			 <p>The mighty JK Rowling&rsquo;s latest reaches us, at long last. After the bombshell ending of <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/02/24/well-this-is-an-exciting/"><cite>The Running Grave</cite></a> two years ago, we have the next installment in Strike and Robin&rsquo;s story. (That should really be &lsquo;Strike and Ellacott&rsquo;s&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Cormoran and Robin&rsquo;s&rsquo;, but sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to write things in the way that <em>feels</em> right).</p>
<p>The case is way complex. I&rsquo;m not sure I followed all the twists, or even quite had all the characters figured out — especially actual and possible victims, even more than culprits. That&rsquo;s partly because of the speed I read it at, and the late nights my reading caused.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll not say too much more because of spoilers, but I think <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/09/12/the-ink-black-heart-by/"><cite>The Ink-Black Heart</cite></a> is still my favourite.</p>

			 <p>I would have said I had rewatched this inside the last five years or so (after seeing it as a kid). But I remembered next to nothing of it, apart from the overall idea and the iconic scenes.</p><p>It's still pretty good. Oddly, it kind of makes me want to see what they did with the remake, but let's face it, the answer is probably, 'made a mess.'</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s unusual to get a science-fiction novel that was also longlisted for the Booker, as this was. The question, though: <em>is</em> it science fiction?</p>
<p>It certainly has science: most notably marine biology. Also space travel to the edge of the solar system via a new, unexplained drive; something which might be a first contact event; possible time travel; and a kind of ascendence. In fact there&rsquo;s a section near the end that had strong resonances of <cite>2001: A Space Odyssey</cite> for me.</p>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s SF. But it feels somehow incomplete. Not unfinished, except in the way you might say that about <cite>2001</cite> itself. It keeps the pages turning OK, but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure exactly what it&rsquo;s trying to achieve, and (therefore) whether it&rsquo;s successful.</p>
<p>It tells two stories at once. And I do wonder whether MacInnes was similarly torn between his desire to write a mainstream, literary novel, and one diving deep into <a href="https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/fantastika">fantastika</a>.</p>
<p>Leigh, the marine biologist who ends up on a space mission, had a physically abusive father, which not surprisingly affects much of her life. Though her sister appears not to have suffered similarly, and there are hints that Leigh is not entirely a reliable narrator. (But then again, who is?) The adult Leigh is torn between her career and her desire to visit her mother, who is showing signs of dementia.</p>
<p>As a marine biologist Leigh experimentally engineers algae which is intended to feed, oxygenate, and cheer up the small crew of a year- (or more) long voyage. But there&rsquo;s a lot going in the background of the story, that Leigh and most of the other characters are not privy to. Secrets kept by companies and governments. We, the readers, are also kept outside the walls of secrecy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very good at evoking the situation of someone who is a cog — albeit an essential one — in very complex machine, but who has no picture of the machine as a whole.</p>
<p>All of which leaves it convincing, but frustrating, especially if you&rsquo;re looking for a nicely wrapped-up story.</p>

			 <p>I had a sudden hankering to reread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory_Road">this old Heinlein book</a> (even older than me, it turns out, being first published in 1963). I read it as a kid, from the library, and if I ever bought a copy it isn&rsquo;t accessible now.</p>
<p>I searched my local library&rsquo;s catalogue. No joy. But the excellent <a href="https://www.wob.com/en-gb">World of Books</a> duly had an old copy or two, and one was soon here.</p>
<p>It is almost exactly as I remembered it, which is to say it&rsquo;s a tale of derring-do, sword-and-sorcery adventure, where the sorcery is sufficiently-advanced technology. We don&rsquo;t learn anything about how it works, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s just a fun story, very much of its time.</p>
<p>The first-person male protagonist is one of those highly-capable men beloved of that era&rsquo;s male American SF writers. But he is relatively lacking in self-confidence at times, which is surprisingly refreshing for the type. The female lead is mostly great, and considerably more capable than the guy, even if he doesn&rsquo;t exactly realise it.</p>
<p>Anyway, loads of fun, and I&rsquo;m glad to have read it again after all these years.</p>

			 <p>I had never heard of Wilder until a year or so ago, but I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2025/01/07/finished-reading-the-bridge-of/">read <cite>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</cite></a> toward the end of last year, and now I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://www.thorntonwilder.com/theophilus-north">this one</a>. I picked it up at a secondhand book stall at our local market a few months ago — at the same time I got <a href="https://devilgate.org/2025/05/22/books-blitzkreig-bops-by-alli/"><cite>Blitzkrieg Bops</cite></a>, actually — and now here we are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1926. The twenties are undeniably roaring, for some people at least. The titular Theophilus, or Teddie, as he prefers to be known, starts the story by leaving his job teaching in a boys' school. He goes on the road, buying a car from a friend, and at first you think it&rsquo;s going to be a pre-Kerouac kind of thing. But within a few paragraphs he&rsquo;s reached Newport Rhode Island, sold the car, and settled down for the summer.</p>
<p>Well, &lsquo;settled down&rsquo; is not quite the right term. In fact, in modern terms, he has to hustle to make a living. Staying at the YMCA at first, he manages to get various jobs teaching kids tennis, tutoring languages, and reading to people. It was long before audiobooks, obviously.</p>
<p>But really, what he&rsquo;s doing is sorting out relationships. Various kinds of relationships, but not that varied kinds of people. Newport is a summer home for the wealthy, the kind of people familiar from that other book about the twenties. You know, the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2013/05/21/the-thirdperson-sanctimonious/">one I&rsquo;ve never managed to like</a>. This lot have more problems, and are more interesting, than Gatsby&rsquo;s crowd. And some of them are kids, too.</p>
<p>He is astonishingly <em>capable</em>, and since the story is told in the first person, it can come across as a tad self-serving, almost boastful at times. But North is so charming, so thoroughly <em>good</em> for people, that it&rsquo;s hard to criticise.</p>
<p>Oh, I should add, it&rsquo;s a comedy of sorts. Among a certain class of reader, myself included, mention Rhode Island and you&rsquo;ll conjure up soul-sucking, squamous, cosmic horror. But there&rsquo;s nothing even vaguely Lovecraftian here. The only horrors are the fear of social ostracism, and one house that is supposedly haunted. North finds a way to remove that stain from the house and ensure that servants will stay there again.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it a lot, but it&rsquo;s a strange little one. It does just about dip into hints of magic realism at a couple of points, but those are mainly North (or Wilder) criticising the kind of people who prey on the vulnerable by offering healing and such.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maybe not fair to compare it to <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite>, just because it&rsquo;s set around the same time. Fitzgerald was writing about his own time, while Wilder was writing fifty years later, making it just on the border of a historical novel for him (though he lived through the time, so not exactly). But I couldn&rsquo;t help drawing the comparison, and I enjoyed this much more.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve read a few of Brookmyre&rsquo;s over the years, and always enjoyed them, but I don&rsquo;t seek him out. So when I chanced on this in Waterstones a week or two back, I had a look. The title immediately made me think of Agatha Christie, of whose books I&rsquo;ve read a few recently, and my partner and I have watched all of the <cite>Poirot</cite> series, and several of the <cite>Miss Marple</cite> TV adaptations.</p>
<p>So when the blurb said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You know Penny Coyne.</strong> The little old lady who has solved multiple murders in her otherwise sleepy village, despite bumbling local police. A razor-sharp mind in a twinset and tweed.</p>
<p><strong>You know Johnny Hawke.</strong> Hard-bitten LAPD homicide detective. Always in trouble with his captain, always losing partners, but always battling for the truth, whatever it takes.</p>
<p>Against all the odds, against the usual story, their worlds are about to collide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there was no way I wasn&rsquo;t buying it. Yes, it&rsquo;s a mashup between Miss Marple and a hard-boiled detective. How? Why? These are questions you&rsquo;ll have to read it to find out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. A gripping read, a page turner. The ending maybe falls a little flat but that might just because I&rsquo;d guessed (or worked out) something fairly early on. I think you&rsquo;re meant to, though.</p>

			 <p>Slightly oddly, I bought this in a bookshop in Canada on our recent trip. I mean, it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> odd. Toronto is an English-speaking city, with decent bookshops: why wouldn&rsquo;t I get it there? Just that it&rsquo;s not in the least Canadian, and it gave me extra weight to carry home.</p>
<p>But it was such a nice bookshop I wanted to support it (BMV on Queen Street West, if you&rsquo;re interested), and this is a book I&rsquo;ve meant to read for years.</p>
<p>Does anyone actually reach the titular maritime safety device/residence? That&rsquo;s one of the things I wanted to know, as well as what else the story was about. Well, it&rsquo;s Woolf, so as I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2018/10/02/mrs-dalloway-by-virginia-woolf/">wrote about <cite>Mrs Dalloway</cite></a>, it&rsquo;s mainly about the inside of people&rsquo;s heads.</p>
<p>Not in a gruesome way; not like that thing they do in <cite>House</cite>, where the camera goes up someone&rsquo;s nose and into their brain (we&rsquo;re watching the first season at the moment). I mean their <em>minds</em>, obviously.</p>
<p>Slightly to my surprise, it&rsquo;s set in Scotland. Specifically, a Hebridean island, generally taken to be Skye, although there&rsquo;s no lighthouse like the one in the story there. A family with about four (five, six?) children — ranging from young adults about to be married off, down to a boy of five or six — have a holiday home there. and spend the summer, along with various guest they&rsquo;ve invited along.</p>
<p>Conversations happen, walks are gone on, and many thoughts are thought. Will James, the young boy, get his desired trip to the lighthouse? Only if it&rsquo;s fair tomorrow, which his father assures him it won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>In fact, we never learn if he goes there on that visit. Part two of the book is entitled &lsquo;Time Passes&rsquo;, and it certainly does. Ten years, in fact, including the First World War. Several characters die offstage. Woolf is content to tell us, in her inimitable style. Showing that kind of thing would not make sense here.</p>
<p>Then in the third section, what&rsquo;s left of the family and invited guests visit the house again. Suffice it to say the weather is fine enough to make the trip, but the sixteen-year old James and his sister Cam do <em>not</em> want to go with their father, but are dragged along anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making light of it (ha ha), but it&rsquo;s a work of complete genius in the way she takes us inside people&rsquo;s thoughts. It is so convincing, even — perhaps especially — the teenage James. It can be difficult at times, but not in an unreadable way. Just in the complexity of the thought processes. Woolf was all about the interiority. It wil bear another reading, I&rsquo;m sure. Probably several.</p>

Which is more sensible. I can&rsquo;t help but imagine some potential readers were put off or confused by that &lsquo;final&rsquo; in <cite>The Final Empire</cite>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>My son basically made me read this. He&rsquo;s a Sanderson fan and I had read none. He (my son) also told me Sanderson wanted to write a fantasy where the good guys had lost. Like what would have Middle Earth been like if Frodo and Sam had failed on their trip to Mordor? Sauron would have got the one ring back and basically been all-powerful.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>So this is basically that, with quite a different setup. The empire is &lsquo;Final&rsquo; because it has lasted a thousand years or more and is never expected to end. Most people live as peasants, near slaves, and few noble houses are allowed to exist because the empire needs trade and internal tensions and what have you. The emperor — The Lord Ruler, as he&rsquo;s known — is basically all-powerful, invulnerable. He&rsquo;s said to have survived various assassination attempts up to and including a beheading. Which seems… wildly improbable, but hey, this is fantasy.</p>
<p>But some people — the titular Mistborn, and others — have special abilities, and there are pockets of resistance.</p>
<p>Sanderson writes a good enough page-turner, but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be going on with the series. First of all there are just <em>too damn many</em>. But more importantly, and surprisingly, this first book is actually quite a complete story, with an ending. Sure, it&rsquo;s a reasonably open ending, with hints of the kind of troubles the characters are going to face, and so on.  But if there were no more books, you wouldn&rsquo;t feel unsatisfied to leave it there.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t care enough about any of the characters to want to invest my time in it. Which is probably its biggest weakness. I even left it at home when we went on holiday to Canada recently. I was about 100 pages from the end and didn&rsquo;t want to have to pack such a huge book that I would probably have finished on the flight over. Which is <em>not</em> how I&rsquo;d have treated <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> back in the day, just to give one example.</p>

			 <p><img src="uploads/2025/1afcdc07ae.jpg"/></p> <p>This was daft, but quite fun. A film based on a board game. Specifically on Cluedo. Which in America, strangely, seems to be called 'Clue'. Why would you <i>not</i> use such a great, clever name as 'Cluedo'? Unless they don't have Ludo there? But that seems impossible.</p><p>Anyway, it's probably the second-best thing I've seen Tim Curry in. Hmm, he was in <i>Times Square</i>, wasn't he? I remember enjoying that, but not much about it.Right now I'd have to but this ahead of it. He plays the butler, and since one couple turn up in the same car, and it's a stormy, rainy night, I was getting serious Brad & Janet vibes. I was disappointed when they had an umbrella on getting out of the car, instead of a newspaper.</p><p>Anyway, the writers had to struggle a bit to fit the conventions of the game into an actual story, but they did OK. There are shenanigans, murders, betrayals, multiple endings. All in all, not bad.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/355287/no-great-mischief-by-alistair-macleod/9780099283928">This was published</a> in 2000, and my partner&rsquo;s parents gave it to me that year or the next. I have a vague feeling I also knew about it from somewhere else. Maybe just saw it in a bookshop and thought it looked interesting. Either way, I never got round to reading it till now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the story of a Scottish family — clan, almost, and certainly they&rsquo;re referred to that way in the Gaelic terms that pepper the book — that migrated to Canada some time after Bonnie Prince Charlie&rsquo;s 1745 uprising. It&rsquo;s simultaneously the history of that migration, and the story of a present-day descendent of the family, now a successful orthodontist in Ontario; and his older brother who is in less successful circumstances. And most of all, of how they came to be that way.</p>
<p>I decided, since we were taking a trip to Canada, that now might finally be the time to read it. I started it on the way to the airport, but I don&rsquo;t think I read any while we were still over there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve finished it now, though, and it&rsquo;s pretty good. Nice use of parallel storylines, various bits about Scottish history and modern-day (well, actually the modern parts are set in the 80s)  Toronto, and so on.</p>
<p>MacLeod came up in conversation while we were over. Not apropos of this; I just recognised the name. He was mentioned as a poet, I think, and I believe that&rsquo;s how he&rsquo;s better known. Still, he&rsquo;s a decent novelist too.</p>

			 <p>This is a strange wee beastie. The edition I have was published in 1998, and I must have bought it then or not long after. I vaguely remember reading a bit of it and finding it amazing, really powerful. And I obviously started it, because I had a bookmark in it, a few pages in.</p>
<p>But every time I&rsquo;ve had a look at it since, it hasn&rsquo;t really grabbed me. Until recently, when I started it again.</p>
<p>And… I&rsquo;ve no idea what I saw in it back then. It&rsquo;s a work of surrealism, but it&rsquo;s just wilfully obscure. Every sentence is grammatically and syntactically sound, but semantically meaningless. It purports to be a catalogue or almanac of a society, with sections titled &lsquo;Sleep&rsquo;, &lsquo;God&rsquo;, &lsquo;Food&rsquo;, and so on. And within them chapters, or short stories, called &lsquo;Sky Destroys Dog&rsquo;,&lsquo;Ethics of Listening When Visiting Areas That Contain Him&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hidden Ball Inside a Song&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It can be strangely compelling in places, almost reaching the level of poetry. But mostly it&rsquo;s a bit of a chore to get through. If I hadn&rsquo;t had it and kept it so long I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered.</p>
<p>A very curious work.</p>

It&rsquo;s a slim volume, taking its title from the Ramones' song &lsquo;Blitzkrieg Bop&rsquo;, and subtitled, &lsquo;A Brief History of Punks at War&rsquo;. Alli Patton is a music journalist from the southern US and this slim book takes a look at how punk, from the 70s through to the 20210s, has been used to resist war, and call for peace and justice.</p>
<p>She starts with Stiff Little Fingers and the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and moves on through apartheid South Africa to Chile during Pinochet&rsquo;s regime and punk bands in East Germany during the Cold War.</p>
<p>And then beyond that, decade by decade. There are always wars and oppression, and it seems there are always punk bands resisting and calling for peace.</p>

			 <h3 id="searching-for-the-man">Searching for the Man</h3>
<p>The state of internet search these days is such that it can be hard to find things that — while you don&rsquo;t <em>know</em> they&rsquo;re there — you know <em>must</em> be there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if the search engines give up after a bit and just show more links to the same videos. Or lyrics sites, in this case. I found myself at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_song">the Wikipedia page for answer songs</a>, and idly scrolled through it. Mainly I wondered what they&rsquo;d say about &lsquo;Here Comes Your Man&rsquo;, by the Pixies. If you&rsquo;ve swum in the same pools of the indie/punk/post-punk floodwaters as me, you&rsquo;ll have long realised that Black Francis must have written that song, in part at least, as an answer to The Velvet Underground&rsquo;s &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Waiting for the Man&rsquo;. (Note the formulation of the title from the first album; many people and versions characterise it as &lsquo;Waiting for My Man&rsquo;, since that&rsquo;s what the lyrics say.)</p>
<p>There was no reference to the song on the page. Slightly odd, I thought. I looked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Comes_Your_Man">the song&rsquo;s own page</a>. No reference there to the Velvets or Lou Reed.</p>
<p>If you doubt the connection, just listen to the two songs. There&rsquo;s the riff on the Pixies song, plus all the references to &lsquo;waiting&rsquo; in it, as well as the obviousness of the title. Sure, it&rsquo;s not <em>only</em> that, or even, really, <em>about</em> &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Waiting for the Man&rsquo; in any sense. But it&rsquo;s unthinkable that the one didn&rsquo;t inspire the other. Let&rsquo;s not forget  Black Francis wrote, in another song, &lsquo;I wanna be a singer like Lou Reed/I <em>like</em> Lou Reed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Others must have written about this, I thought, and started googling around. Well, I use DuckDuckGo, but you know. And I even tried switching to Google. Nothing came up, except for the odd little Reddit post saying, &lsquo;Hey, this song&rsquo;s a bit like that song.&rsquo; Yet you&rsquo;ve got to imagine — it&rsquo;s hard <em>not</em> to imagine – people will have written about it. Music journalists, bloggers… hell, I&rsquo;m surprised <em>I</em> haven&rsquo;t mentioned it before now.</p>
<p>But nothing turned up. I&rsquo;m sure those pages are out there, lost for now in the deep pools of the web. But the search engines just don&rsquo;t want to go there anymore.</p>
<h3 id="tying-ribbons">Tying Ribbons</h3>
<p>I was looking into answer songs because I&rsquo;d been reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_a_Yellow_Ribbon_Round_the_Ole_Oak_Tree">page on &lsquo;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&rsquo;</a>, and it mentioned there being an answer song.</p>
<p>I was looking at <em>that</em> page because we were talking about the origin of people tying yellow ribbons when they&rsquo;re waiting for someone to come home. I thought it might have originated with the song. It was certainly the first time most of us here in the UK heard the expression. When Americans festooned buildings with yellow ribbons during the Iran hostage crisis, it seemed like a reference to the song.</p>
<p>But the page suggested the origin is much older, possibly going back to the US civil war. So much for that.</p>
<p>We were talking about yellow ribbons because people are displaying them again: waiting for the remaining hostages in Gaza to be freed.</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s government is doubtless guilty of war crimes, probably crimes against humanity. And October the 7th was a crime against humanity. I&rsquo;m all for freeing Palestine, but free the hostages too, and if you can get rid of Hamas too while you&rsquo;re doing it, so much the better.</p>
<p>Free Palestine from Hamas.</p>

<p>'Walk on the Wild Side' is the second track from <cite>Transformer</cite> to feature on <a href="https://app.crucialtracks.org/">Crucial Tracks</a>, I note, but that's not surprising. I'd consider it a 'crucial album'.</p>

			 <p>I read one of the pieces from this, &lsquo;At the Dam&rsquo;, on my <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">MA course</a>. It didn&rsquo;t make a huge impact on me at the time, but enough to keep Didion&rsquo;s name in my mind, and eventually to stir up enough interest for me to get this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a set of personal essays covering various events around the end of the sixties and the early seventies. It struck me, reading this, she&rsquo;s kind of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_journalism">gonzo journalist</a>, or at least gonzo-adjacent, in that the often puts herself in the narrative. Which is good and proper in my humble opinion. Not as intense as HST, but still.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of good, interesting stuff here, including one piece that involves her hanging out with The Doors, waiting for Jim Morrison to arrive. It&rsquo;s not much about music, though, and I don&rsquo;t know why she chose to call it <cite>The White Album</cite>.</p>
<p>One minor annoyance about at least this edition is, although the front matter credits the various publications the pieces originally appeared in (<cite>Life</cite>, <cite>The New York Review of Books</cite>, etc), it doesn&rsquo;t tell us which piece appeared where.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t detract from the pieces themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which song would you use to introduce yourself to someone new?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure this is a thing I've ever done in the musical kind of sense, but I guess somebody might say, 'Tell me a song you love,' or something. I could answer with 'Sit Down' by James, for sure.</p>
<p>I saw them live a ton of times in the late eighties/early nineties. They're probably the band I've seen most, along with The Pogues and The Fall. Including on my 25th birthday, headlining the Reading Festival. Actually The Pogues were on that day, too. Or so my memory says, even if the Reading histories don't.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about 'Sit Down' is that they released it as a single and it didn't do much. I saw the video a load of times on the old ITV Chart Show on Saturday mornings back when I lived in Walthamstow.</p>
<p>But like a year or so later they didn't just rerelease it; they rerecorded it, with reordered verses, and a more upbeat performance. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew7Zkkucos8">Here's the original video on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>The new version, of course, became a huge hit.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s annoying that the song I want to use for the prompt, &lsquo;Share a song that tells a great story,&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t found on Apple Music. It&rsquo;s sitting right there in my music library being fantastic, ever since I ripped it from a Cover CD from <cite>Uncut</cite> magazine, back in 2002.</p>
<p>It tells the tale of a pair of lovers that we might describe, in the clichéd form, as &lsquo;star-crossed&rsquo;. But it&rsquo;s not a tale of young lovers. Rather, the titular pair are experienced, world-weary (certainly by the end), but they keep on keeping on.</p>

And the lead actor: Dylan too.</p><p>Yes, in 2003, Bob Dylan wrote and starred in this film. In a country in state of constant revolution and war, with the dictator-president dying, a singer is released from prison to play a benefit concert. It's not clear why, but 'The Network' wants to broadcast it. </p><p>And Uncle Sweetheart, played by John Goodman, is hoping to get rich from it. It can't end well, and Jeff Bridges, as a journalist who talks a lot more than he writes, listens, or observes, is supposed to be uncovering the corruption.</p><p>It can't end well, and frankly it's a bit incoherent. Enjoyable enough though, and certainly interesting to the Dylan fan.</p>

At the heart of history’s most successful eradication campaign is a mystery. The smallpox vaccine—now also being deployed against monkeypox—contains a live virus that confers immunity against multiple poxviruses. But it is not smallpox or a weakened version thereof. Nor is it monkeypox. Nor is it cowpox, as suggested by the vaccine’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200696/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famous origin story</a> involving pus taken from an infected milkmaid to immunize an 8-year-old boy.

</blockquote><script note="" src="https://cdn.micro.blog/quoteback.js"></script>
<p>The vaccine predates systematic, controlled manufacture, so several or many versions were made from various sources. And they were transferred by sending infected children around the world! I do seem to recall hearing that last part before, but not the fact that its true origin is shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>As far as representing my current mood goes, I'm actually just hungry. But Springsteen's 'Hungry Heart' is always a good choice. The story goes he wrote it for The Ramones, or at least was going to offer it to them. But he decided to keep it, and of course put it on <cite>The River</cite>.</p>
<p>That album — and most of his gigs since — wouldn't have been the same without it. But I'd still love to have heard The Ramones do it.</p>

<p>Lou Reed is one of my all-time faves, both with the Velvets and solo. This one popped into my mind this morning as we were walking back from badminton (playing the game, not the place where they have horsey things). It’s from the mighty <cite>Transformer</cite> album.</p>

<p>First love, eh? 'Music was my first love,' as an old song has it, 'And it'll be my last.' But that's not what this is about, really, is it?</p>
<p>Let's go with The Ramones (they were going to turn up some time, in one or another form, of course), where they made it on to <cite>Top of the Pops</cite>. Maybe because Phil Spector was at the controls, though we'd have to hope not.</p>

<p>'What is your favorite song from last year?' I am asked by the daily prompt from Crucial Tracks.</p>
<p>'Favourite,' I say. The 'favorite' spelling reads like a made-up element from thirties SF, or some such.</p>
<p>But I'm avoiding the question. The thing is, what this tells me is, I don't listen to much new music these days. Or, when I do, it doesn't impinge, doesn't resonate with me, become something I go back to.</p>
<p>I spent a chunk of 2024 listening through a list from <cite>The Guardian</cite>, of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/05/the-50-best-albums-of-2023">the 50 best albums of 2023</a>, in order to check out what was good and recent. I had already heard the PJ Harvey, the Gina Birch, and the Boygenius albums, all of which I liked.</p>
<p>None of the others made enough of an impact to count, sadly. That is, none of them got a second play. One, I think, I gave a decent chance, but couldn't even finish.</p>
<p>And anyway, they were all new works from the year before last, not last year.</p>
<p>So for the purposes of this prompt, I'm allowing 'new to me' to count. And while I love PJ Harvey, so you might expect one of hers to make the cut, <cite>I Inside the Old Year Dying</cite> is too much an <em>album</em>. It's its own unique thing, but I don't recall a specific standout track from it.</p>
<p>So I'm going with Boygenius and, in another acknowledgment of my lack of new-music-attention, their one that namechecks an old singer — one of my favourites.</p>

			 <p>I just watched the latest <em>Doctor Who</em> episode, ‘Lux’.  It was <em>gloriously</em> meta. Who needs fourth walls? And with a love note to the fandom in the middle.</p>
<p>The best episode RTD has done, certainly in this incarnation. IMHO, obviously.</p>

<p>I did not sing along to anything today, as the daily prompt asks. But I did find myself singing this Meat Loaf ditty, at least in my head. Maybe aloud, who knows?</p>
<p>Interesting that it appears as by Meat Loaf & Ellen Foley. Entirely appropriate, as it's a duet. But I don't think it was originally billed that way, and the modern approach would be to include 'Feat Ellen Foley' right in the title text. As I wrote about several years ago in <a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/03/06/little-feat/">Little, Feat..</a>.</p>

Fantastic footage and sound from a gig that I've never even heard of before (though I think I've seen some of the footage). Great extracts from TV news broadcasts of the time, all sorts of great stuff.</p><p>Turns out there was an asylum/hospital/children's home kinda place where hundreds of kids with learning disabilities and other problems were kept in horrific conditions. Seeing the footage of it, I was reminded of the Romanian orphans that led JK Rowling to set up her Lumos charity. </p><p>John & Yoko learned about the place back in the day and set up the titular One to One benefit concert, raising money to help to provide better lives for those kids.</p><p>The strangest thing is that I've never heard about this concert before.</p><p>I will be watching this film again, you can be sure.</p>

<p>Today's prompt is 'Share a song that changed your perspective on music.'</p>
<p>I'm gonna have to go back to 1977 for this one. That year may not surprise you, being as it was the core of the original punk days.</p>
<p>I was 13, as of August. 'No More Heroes' came out in September, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_More_Heroes_(The_Stranglers_song)">Wikipedia tells me</a>. I can't tell you when I first heard it, but I do know it was on a Sunday afternoon, after a week in which my friend Brendan had strongly urged me to get into punk.</p>
<p>It came on the radio, and it was the first punk song I heard.</p>
<p>The Stranglers were less punky than the Pistols, Clash, Damned, etc, of course, being older and to some extent, bandwagon jumpers. But who gave a fuck about that when they made a song as good as this?</p>

			 <p><img src="uploads/2025/41b5a3421f.jpg"/></p> <p>This has a slightly interesting connection to home for me. Just last week we were walking past St John of Hackney churchyard, a common route from the Narrow Way home, when we stopped to look at a plaque outside the Hackney Mortuary. It describes the top-secret military operation the film is named after. The dead body that was used to deceive the Nazis was stored at the mortuary for three months. You can see a picture of the plaque at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat" rel="nofollow">the Wikipedia page for the mission</a>.</p><p>So why not watch the film? It's an interesting story, it's got an impressive cast, and it's on Netflix.</p><p>Good thing about that last, because we'd have been mildly annoyed if we'd had to pay extra for it. Trouble is, it's not very good.</p><p>It's not terrible. Two-and-a-half stars from me means it's OK, but just barely. On another day I might have given it three. The problem might be with us: knowing the story in advance could remove all tension, except from the romance subplot. But no, I think that was OK. I think it's more that sometimes the various parts of a film — which is a complex thing to create, after all — don't come together well enough, for reasons that are hard to define.</p>

<p>My earliest musical memory might be this. I was well under five, maybe only three. My gran — my mum’s mum — was staying with us because she wasn’t well. I walked into her room with my big sister, singing.</p>
<p>Says gran, ‘Is he swearing?’ My sister had to explain that I wasn’t saying, ‘Oh bloody’ something.</p>

<p>It seems wildly unlikely that I — or indeed, anyone — could have a single ‘favourite song’ throughout high school. Not least since ’high school’ itself is not a commonly-used term here in the UK. Though my secondary school <em>did</em> actually have ‘High School’ in its name.</p>
<p>Secondary school lasts six or seven years, though (true, back then, some got out after four, but even so). Who’s going to keep the same fave for that long, especially during such formative years?</p>
<p>At the start, if I had a single fave, it would have certainly been by The Beatles. By the end it would  have been The Clash or Stiff Little Fingers.</p>
<p>So let's go with 'London Calling', a Clash song that mentions The Beatles, albeit negatively: 'phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust.'</p>

<blockquote><p> What is a song that instantly energizes you?</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel I should answer that with something relating to <cite>Star Trek</cite>, but that’s the wrong kind of ‘energize’ (or ‘energise’, as I would spell it). </p>
<p>Although ‘Another Girl, Another Planet’ does sound like it could be about Captain Kirk.</p>
<p>I’ve heard it described as Peter Perret’s love song to heroin, but also seen a more recent interview where he said it wasn’t about that. </p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to get me on the dancefloor, this one’s chugging intro is always a good bet. </p>
<p>‘Space travel’s in my blood,’ after all. </p>

<p>The prompt was 'What song do you wish you had written?' So many, of course, especially since I used to play guitar very badly and sing in bands, and I <em>have</em> written a few songs.<br />
<br />
But for some reason, the one that popped into my mind was 'If I Can't Change Your Mind' by Sugar. Bob Mould's work after Hüsker Dü was varied, but this track off Sugar's first album is just glorious.</p>

<p>And if this were a prime example, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d bother with more, sadly. It&rsquo;s not a bad idea. The titular interpreter is a human on a far-future Earth that is occupied by a tripedal alien race. Their empire has developed by trade and trickery as much as by military conquest, and it seems that&rsquo;s how Earth was taken.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a far-flung outpost, one of four million systems in the empire, so there&rsquo;s bound to be corruption. An emissary is sent from the imperial centre to investigate reports of the Earth administrator abusing its people, which he/she/it (they&rsquo;re a sexually trimorphic species) is. Our far-from-heroic interpreter might just have a chance to get the truth out.</p>
<p>As I say, not a bad idea, just not that well told. There&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with the writing, except for the dialogue being stilted. Oddly, it&rsquo;s fine between the interpreter and the aliens — maybe the fact that we know he&rsquo;s translating lessens the effect. But between the humans, it&rsquo;s just clunky.</p>
<p>And the plot is just about believable. Just. Luckily it&rsquo;s only 126 pages; and I did sit up to finish it last night, so I guess it&rsquo;s got something.</p>

			 <p>I got this as a Christmas present some several years ago, and read bits of it. It&rsquo;s episodic, though — a separate essay on each of the songs, plus an &lsquo;Instrumental Break — so I dipped in and out of it. I was encouraged to pick it up again recently because of the name-similarity with a great podcast I&rsquo;m listening to and keep meaning to write about here: <cite><a href="https://500songs.com">A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs</a></cite>, by Andrew Hickey.</p>
<p>Marcus&rsquo;s title is overconfident to the point of arrogance by calling the book <em>the</em> history. As if there was and could be only one. To say nothing of the idea that it could be encapsulated in ten songs. Hickey&rsquo;s is more aware, and he makes the point repeatedly that his is only <em>a</em> history.</p>
<p>But Marcus is a terrific writer, and, like Hickey&rsquo;s, the title is not literal: when discussing any one song he&rsquo;ll touch on several others, plus various events in the lives of the artists and the goings-on in the world.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t honestly say that I learned much from this, or retained much of what I may have learned, but it&rsquo;s a joy to read. The pleasure is in the journey more than the destination.</p>

			 <p>I remember seeing Brunner at a convention 30 years ago, or more, talking about &lsquo;the death of the midlist&rsquo;: how writers who sold their work steadily to publishers, and to readers, used to be able to make a living from doing so, but no longer could. I wonder what he&rsquo;d make of the publishing scene today.</p>
<p>Anyway, this slim book from 1966 hides its science-fictional nature till almost the very end. Unless you&rsquo;ve read the blurb. Or indeed, this post, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Productions_of_Time">the wikipedia entry about it</a>. A theatre actor, a recovering alcoholic not long out of a sanatorium, gets the chance to work with a hip writer and director.</p>

<p>Or at least, that&rsquo;s what they want the cast members to think.</p>

			 <p>An Agatha Christie book from 1961, and set round about then, too. We start in Chelsea espresso bar, where the main narrator, Mark Easterbrook, observes a fight between two beatnik/proto-hippie rich girls, and the first clue is sneaked in.</p>
<p>Easterbrook is no famous detective, though, either professional or amateur. He&rsquo;s a historian who is trying to finish writing a book. But things happen, and soon the action moves to the English countryside where its author is most comfortable.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>He meets Ginger Corrigan, who the blurb describes as &lsquo;his sidekick&rsquo;, which suggests to me an ongoing series and many adventures. And maybe that&rsquo;s what Christie had planned, who knows. But this is standalone.</p>
<p>Anyway, the titular Pale Horse is a former pub where three women live, and perhaps cast spells. Certainly they give seances and such. But are they using magic to murder people remotely? Well that&rsquo;s what our heroes have to find out, of course.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m finding season 2 of <cite>Severance</cite> quite annoying. The pacing is glacial. Every episode, I wait for something to happen, and they pile up more mysteries. Very slowly.</p>
<p>Take episode 7, for example, where they filled in Mark &amp; Gemma&rsquo;s backstory. All very nice, but completely unnecessary. We already knew they&rsquo;d been a loving couple. We knew she was dead, and that she&rsquo;s not actually dead. They didn&rsquo;t need to spell out every little detail. What&rsquo;s going on with her now is intriguing, but I no longer even care much about <em>what</em> is going on, just <em>why</em>? And <em>when</em> are they going to burn that fucking Lumon cult to the ground?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this idea with modern &lsquo;prestige TV&rsquo;, that telling a story (or adapting a book) as an eight- or ten-episode series is better than trying to squash the same story into a two-hour film. And there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for that. Give the story room to breathe.</p>
<p><cite>Severance</cite> spends too much time listening to its own breathing.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind all this so much if I knew how much more of it there was to go, and that there was a fully-planned story, and that it <em>would actually get made</em>. I&rsquo;ve not forgotten the deep disappointment of <a href="https://devilgate.org/2019/12/15/oa-going-away/">Netflix&rsquo;s completely random cancelling of <cite>The OA</cite></a>. And there we know Brit Marling had the whole thing planned out across five seasons.</p>
<p>Also the reason for my title: it&rsquo;s trying too hard to be <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, and failing. You&rsquo;re not David Lynch. No one is any more. Stop it, and just tell the story. A bit quicker.</p>

			 <p>There was a post about how &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t post your way out of fascism&rsquo; that did the rounds a few weeks ago. I have a feeling it might have done some harm.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read it in detail. Saw the headline, skimmed it, got the gist. Resistance to Trump/Muskism and the other right-wing authoritarian risings around the world: it needs more than tweets, toots, blog posts.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>But not everyone <em>can</em> do more, or give more. And even those who can, or could or should: for some of us, writing is not just what we do, it&rsquo;s what we <em>are</em>. We <em>need</em> to write. And I know I&rsquo;ve felt some discouragement a few times lately, when I might have written about Trump, or Musk&rsquo;s nazi salute, or the general horror of things. I&rsquo;ve thought, &lsquo;Yeah, but &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t post your way…&quot;&rsquo;</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say my memory, my knowledge of the existence of that post has <em>stopped</em> me posting. Other things, or a combination of things, have done that. But it&rsquo;s in there, like a spectre at the writing table, saying, &lsquo;No, this isn&rsquo;t enough, so you shouldn&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is almost certainly not what the writer intended. But I think it&rsquo;s unhelpful at best, and may be harmful to some people at worst.</p>
<p>Posting won&rsquo;t be enough to get us out of fascism, but it might help some people to get <em>through</em> it.</p>
<p>So please, everyone, don&rsquo;t be discouraged; and don&rsquo;t stop posting.</p>

And as LeGuin&rsquo;s wall round a spaceport both closes the planet off from the rest of the universe, and encloses the universe, depending on how you look at it; so VanderMeer&rsquo;s tower has its topological oddity. It starts at ground level and goes down, into the ground underneath it, rather than rising into the air.</p>
<p>Or so the Biologist sees it, But this is Area X, and things are rarely as they seem.</p>
<p>The Biologist is the first person narrator. Accompanied by three other women — the Psychologist, the Anthropologist, and the Surveyor — they are the latest in a series of groups sent in to investigate the mysterious zone.</p>
<p>Almost everything is unexplained in this book. It is incredibly compelling, gripping, even, but everything remains unexplained, the ending is open. Yet while there are three more books in the series, I feel it&rsquo;s such a perfect little nugget, beautifully crafted, that to read on would almost spoil it.</p>
<p>I suspect that&rsquo;s not true, though. We are in safe hands with VanderMeer, so I expect the continuation will be sound. I remember my friend Simon having a similar response when he read <a href="https://www.gollancz.co.uk/titles/dan-simmons/hyperion/9781399609500/"><cite>Hyperion</cite></a>. Its perfectly-crafted open ending seemed to him like it didn&rsquo;t need a sequel. But of course <cite>The Fall of Hyperion</cite> was magnificent, and so were the two <cite>Endymion</cite> followups.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is great, but you probably already knew that, what with winning awards and being ten years old.</p>

			 <p>Looks like Amazon&rsquo;s deal with Iain Banks&rsquo;s estate to make a series out of <cite>Consider Phlebas</cite> is <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/consider-phlebas-amazon-charles-yu-chloe-zhao-1236300861/">back on</a>.</p>
<p>Pity it&rsquo;s Amazon, but at least Adele is involved as an executive producer.</p>
<p>I remember Banksie saying all he wanted to see was the fight under the hovercraft, so let&rsquo;s hope they leave that in.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://devilgate.org/2025/02/23/books-northanger-abbey-by-jane/">📗Books 2025, 4: Northanger Abbey, by Jane Austen </a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2025/02/23/books-northanger-abbey-by-jane/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-23 17:46:41 &#43;0100">Feb 23, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We started watching <cite>Miss Austen</cite>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Austen">
BBC serial about Jane&rsquo;s sister Cassandra</a> trying to get hold of Jane&rsquo;s letters a few years after her death. That made me want to read some more Austen, the only I&rsquo;ve read before being <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite>.</p>
<p>So I tried <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781903025628"><cite>Northanger Abbey</cite></a>. Which is mainly a spoof of the gothic novels that Austen herself would have been reading at the time, and also, of course, a romance.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it a lot, but it ended very surprisingly. It has the omniscient narrator you might expect for a book of its time, but it&rsquo;s mostly written in close third-person. We are privy to Catherine&rsquo;s thoughts and fears. But the thing is, when we get to the climactic scene, when everything is going to be resolved and our heroine end up happy (it&rsquo;s not much of a spoiler), Austen (or the narrator) turns away.</p>
<p>Instead of being with Catherine as the hero rides to her emotional rescue, we are told about it. We&rsquo;re kept at a distance, no longer aware of what&rsquo;s going on in her head. It&rsquo;s an absolute masterclass in the difference between &lsquo;showing&rsquo; and &lsquo;telling&rsquo; in writerly terms; but the wrong way round for a really satisfying experience.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a continuation of the style of those gothic romances she was parodying, but read today, it&rsquo;s a strange choice.</p>

Characters of no merit, dialogue that sometimes reaches snappy but often sits in the leaden cliché realm, and just general horribleness. </p><p>It's good for the scenes of New York, the crowd scenes in bars and restaurants, and yes, it has its moments. But overall, no, didn't do it for me.</p><p>It's not like amoral characters make the film amoral, but you need to have someone to root for. That should be the gossip columnists's sister and jazz guitarist who were a couple. Sadly they're just too feeble (and too sidelined) as characters.</p>

			 <p>I think I read somewhere that <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526643216">this</a> ends on a huge cliffhanger. It doesn&rsquo;t. Or I wouldn&rsquo;t describe it in those terms.</p>
<p>It has an epilogue, entitled &lsquo;The Old Man at the End&rsquo;, set 50 years or so after the main story. Someone we take to be the protagonist fears for his life; and the close-third-person narration hints at or mentions some events that intrigue. But we&rsquo;re not left hanging.</p>
<p>The book <em>is</em> described as &lsquo;a Long London novel&rsquo;. though, so we certainly expect additions to the series in time.</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;Long London&rsquo; is not used in the book, I think, though our normal, everyday London is called &lsquo;Short London&rsquo; at one point. &lsquo;The Great When&rsquo; <em>is</em> used, and is one of the terms for another London that exists parallel to ours in some sense. Certain people, with certain kinds of imagination (or damage), can find and use some few portals between the two realms.</p>
<p>You know the sort of thing. Parallel worlds, unseen realities, aren&rsquo;t exactly new. But Moore is such a good writer, this is a high, fine example of the form, even if there have been others like it before. The  richness of his description and believability of his characters make this a five-star affair, if I gave stars to books.</p>
<p>And books are key here. It all kicks of in 1949, when Dennis Knuckleyard, 18 years old, orphaned in the war, and working in a second-hand book shop, comes into the possession of a book that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>It is imaginary, being named in an Arthur Machen tale. Which means he has to get it back to the other London before very bad things start happening.</p>
<p>Highly recommended, and I eagerly anticipate the next volume, despite not being cliffhung by this one.</p>

<p>Light blogging year, then, but I&rsquo;ve written quite a lot of fiction, so there&rsquo;s that. To say nothing of things like the currently-1500-word essay on <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/06/06/i-keep-thinking-i-should/">my thoughts and feelings about AI</a>, wherein I try to understand those things.

			 <p>I read about <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781852428426">this</a> some four years ago on <a href="https://jackdeighton.co.uk/2021/04/24/vivaldi-and-the-number-3-by-ron-butlin/">Jack Deighton&rsquo;s blog</a>. It sounded interesting enough that I tried to order it via <a href="https://www.pagesofhackney.co.uk">Pages of Hackney</a>. But they told me it was out of print.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t even find it on Amazon; no Kindle version. So I left it.</p>
<p>Until just recently, when I had cause to by some second-hand books from <a href="https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb">World of Books</a>. Something made me think of this one. Quick search, and there it was.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s even weirder and more fun than I imagined from reading Jack&rsquo;s review. It&rsquo;s a series of short stories, with some interconnections, about various classical composers (plus some philosophers). But it&rsquo;s all deeply surreal. You&rsquo;ll find Beethoven living in present-day Edinburgh, for example.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it all for? I don&rsquo;t really know. But they&rsquo;re great little vignettes, easily digestible, and lots of fun.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t really picked up on blogging properly since this year started. I didn&rsquo;t, for example, write a summary post about last year&rsquo;s entries, as I generally do. I&rsquo;m also behind on books updates. <a href="https://devilgate.org/2025/02/11/books-the-murder-of-roger/">The other day&rsquo;s post</a> was about a book I finished very early in January.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve been kind of off the whole thing since November or so. Maybe earlier, but the USA&rsquo;s apocalyptically stupid choice of head of state was the anti-icing on the un-cake of my feelings about the world in general.</p>
<p>I feel like I might be coming out of that downturn now. And strangely, I think I&rsquo;ve got my new blog theme to thank for it. In part, anyway.</p>
<p>It seems daft, but just freshening the place up can make a difference, you know?

Their voices work beautifully together when they harmonise, and it's notable that both actors did all their singling vocals.</p><p>We see moments of the next few years, culminating in Dylan's famous appearance with an electric band at the Newport Folk Festival.</p><p>For a film set in the sixties, it's surprisingly pure. Not just in the sense of Seeger and the other folk purists on the Newport organising committee. There's hardly any suggestion of sex, and no drugs at all.</p><p>No drugs. In the sixties. Unless you count cigarettes (of which there are a lot) and alcohol (most of which Johnny Cash, played by Boyd Holbrook, has already consumed). There are scenes where Dylan, at least, is clearly meant to be stoned, but no consumption.</p><p>I think that says something about our times, rather than the time of the movie, but I'm not sure what.</p><p>Will you enjoy this if you're not already a fan, and/or know some of the story? Probably not as much as I did, but see it for the beautifully-realised exteriors and interiors of old New York, for the performances, and of course, for the music.</p><p>I want to go to a singalong showing now.</p>

			 <p>This morning I read the whole of the <a href="https://archive.is/J31rj"><cite>Vulture</cite> article about Neil Gaiman</a>.

<p>It&rsquo;s so depressing that a man who seemed so decent, so generally a positive force in the world, can turn out to have been an abuser all these year. Allegedly, I suppose I must say.</p>

			 <p>After my recent <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/12/15/conclave.html">viewing of the film</a> based on this, my daughter got me  <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780735273344">the book</a> for Christmas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising how compelling a book can be when you know exactly what&rsquo;s going to happen, and it&rsquo;s about something that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally give a toss about. Though on the latter, I suppose the boy can leave the church, but it always leaves its mark, or something.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out this Harris guy can really write. Who&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve thought?</p>
<p>I note with interest that the &lsquo;why this story, why now&rsquo; question that I mentioned when writing about he film, never even crossed my mind while reading this. I approach a book with a different set of expectations from how I do a film, maybe.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading several weeks ago, in fact. I&rsquo;m way behind with the change of year.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is an odd little book. I stress the &lsquo;little&rsquo; because it&rsquo;s very short. We&rsquo;re in Peru. An ancient rope bridge, of Inca origin, collapses one day, killing the five people who were crossing it. A priest, Brother Juniper, witnesses the event and decides to use it to prove God has a plan for humans.</p>
<p>The narrator, however, tells us that Juniper&rsquo;s eventual vast book on the subject was derided, destroyed, and in any case incomplete. The narrator knows things about the people that Juniper never learned. How the narrator knows these things is never stated — we might assume it&rsquo;s because the narrator is also the author, though that&rsquo;s rarely a safe assumption.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the start. The rest of the book consists of the stories of the victims and how they came to be there on that day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. Won the Pulitzer.</p>

I mentioned this in <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/10/13/of-all-the.html">my <cite>Nineteen Eighty-Four</cite> post</a>, since the first and last stories are inspired by Orwell&rsquo;s novel. The last being the title story.</p>
<p>Both they, and the others, are very good. Ken&rsquo;s usual concerns are here, of course: the future, politics, Scotland, and more.</p>
<p>Also the cover and internal illustrations are by Fangorn. Highly recommended.</p>

			 <p><img src="uploads/2025/f11fb760a3.jpg"/></p> <p>When I was a kid, brought up in the Roman Catholic Church, my Mum taught me that, when a pope dies, all the cardinals get together to choose a new one. God guides them so they vote for who He has chosen, and it has to be unanimous.</p><p>Whether or not that unanimity requirement was ever really true, I can't say. But that's certainly not how it happens in this film. I imagine this tale is closer to the reality, humans being political beings with preferences and schemes. And God not existing, of course. Or, if 'He' does, certainly not taking that kind of hand in human events.</p><p>I enjoyed this story of the events after an unnamed, imaginary pope's death. It's well acted and beautifully shot. It does have one or two moments that tend to the over-theatrical, let's say.</p><p>But I have to wonder why the filmmakers chose to tell it, and why now. It's an adaptation of Robert Harris's novel from 2016, and could ask the same question of him: why that story, whey then?</p><p>And I guess you tell the story you want to tell, and why not? If other people enjoy it, or get something from it, that's all that matters, really.</p>

			 <p>I laugh gently at <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/11/08/finished-reading-the.html">my past self</a>, musing that <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784971625">this volume</a>, based on its title, might have a <em>less</em> bleak universe-view.</p>
<p>Reader, it does not.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s the thing I liked least about this whole trilogy, the dark view of the universe, of sentience. The idea that every species that develops intelligence and advances to the point of thinking about space travel and the idea of possibly communicating with other intelligent species; that they would all have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide">xenocidal</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> instinct. Have it, and routinely, casually act on it, by wiping out the star systems of other species they detect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it couldn&rsquo;t be so. As one explanation for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi paradox</a> it&rsquo;s exactly that: one explanation. But it&rsquo;s just too fuckin <em>bleak</em> for my tastes.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this story, and the trilogy as a whole, is jam-packed with ideas, stuff about relativity, higher and lower dimensions, all sorts of good hard-SF stuff. The characters are kind of blank, undeveloped: I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be sticking in my memory. But I enjoyed it overall.</p>
<p>Apart from when I was annoyed/disturbed/upset by the dark forest idea.</p>
<p>Your central idea: I do not like it.</p>

			 <p>I was shocked, but not exactly surprised, by the US election result. Or no: I was surprised. I think I had somehow internalised that idea that Kamala Harris would win. It seemed unthinkable that Americans would elect Trump again.</p>
<p>But then, it seemed unthinkable that they would elect him <a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/01/20/trumpeting.html">the first time</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised though. Among the presidents in my lifetime, we&rsquo;ve had Nixon, Reagan, Bush, and W Bush. All of them considered to be dangerous warmongering borderline fascists at the time. And/or comical and incompetent choices, to consider Reagan and W Bush, specifically.</p>
<p>Yet America elected all of them (notwithstanding that the popular vote nearly always favoured their Democratic opponent).</p>
<p>Trump, of course, rolls the ills of all of them up into one great ugly package, and adds narcissism on top. And the times could hardly be worse for women in America in particular, with reproductive healthcare under attack with the overturning of <cite>Roe v Wade</cite>.</p>
<p>What can you do, though? Life goes on. We&rsquo;ll get through it, except for those of us who don&rsquo;t.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784971618">This</a> is somehow much less obscure and strange than <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/10/20/finished-reading-the.html">the first one</a>. I don&rsquo;t know how much that is to do with it having a different translator, but it&rsquo;s possible. The third one is back to Ken Liu, who translated the first one, so maybe we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>The other odd thing is that when I added this to Micro.blog&rsquo;s Bookshelves feature, it came up with a subtitle I&rsquo;ve never heard of before: &lsquo;Remembrance of Earth’s Past, #2&rsquo;. On the book&rsquo;s title page, and in any other discussion I&rsquo;ve heard of, it&rsquo;s always referred to as &lsquo;The Three-Body Trilogy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Getting to the story itself: perhaps the least believable thing about the whole thing is the idea humans could be convinced to believe that an alien invasion force was on its way to Earth and would arrive in 450 years. To believe and act toward resisting the force or ameliorating the situation by escaping or anything else.</p>
<p>I mean, in the real world we can&rsquo;t even get people to believe in, get governments and businesses to act on, the climate emergency, and its effects are visible day by day.</p>
<p>The climate is largely ignored in this book, as well, though in the latter part, set two hundred years after the start, we see some extreme desertification in China.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty bleak in places, in its philosophy, this one; especially as regards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi paradox</a>, or a solution thereto. But it leaves us at a point where I&rsquo;m thinking, &lsquo;Where now? That feels like a decent ending.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But <cite>Death&rsquo;s End</cite> (great title, and potentially a much less bleak philosophy, if it matches the title) is sitting waiting, all 700+ pages of it. Why does each volume of a trilogy tend to be longer than the one before?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> So we&rsquo;ll see where that takes us.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this. There&rsquo;s a lot of telling, and the characters maybe aren&rsquo;t very clearly differentiated, but it&rsquo;s full of ideas.</p>

			 <p>It seems Facebook still has the odd use, apart from keeping in touch with family and friends who still use it. I popped in late last night, and it told me I had memories on this day. It seems the 29th of October has been a day on which I&rsquo;ve often posted in the past, because there were several. But the one that really caught my eye was this one:</p>
<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://devilgate.org/uploads/2024/jason-sandinista-memory.png" alt="A screen grab from Facebook. The text is below." title="Jason Sandinista Memory" border="1" width="588" height="224" />
<p>15 years ago, it tells me, in 2009, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason Ringenberg doing The Clash&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ivan Meets Gl Joe&rsquo;: a thing of rare beauty. Spotify URI: <a href="http://is.gd/4Hcr7">http://is.gd/4Hcr7</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s quite telling, in several ways. First of all, remember the <code>is.gd</code> URL shortener? Remember <em>URL shorteners that aren&rsquo;t <code>t.co</code></em>?</p>
<p>Also, I haven&rsquo;t used Spotify in a long time, being a happy Apple Music subscriber. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter. What&rsquo;s really weird is that I have absolutely no memory of Jason (out of Jason &amp; the Scorchers, as I&rsquo;m sure you know) doing any Clash song, much less a surprising choice of <cite>Sandinista</cite> album track.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> And back then I was listening to Jason quite a lot.</p>
<p>Obviously I quickly searched for it on Apple Music. To find that it&rsquo;s part of an album. Not one by Jason, though. <cite><a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/2107226-Various-The-Sandinista-Project-A-Tribute-To-The-Clash">The Sandinista! Project</a></cite><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> is a compilation album of covers of the entirety of <cite>Sandinista</cite> by different artists.</p>
<p>Why was I not told such a thing existed?</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that I <em>was</em> told of it, one way or another. Some passing mention, a mental note, quickly forgotten… maybe it was mentioned in Jason&rsquo;s newsletter or some such.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not a totally off the wall idea. It&rsquo;s subtitled &lsquo;A Tribute to The Clash&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;ve had or listened to things like it before. I had something called <cite>London Booted</cite> once, which was sort of techno-ish covers of some or all of the tracks from <cite>London Calling</cite>. And I remember listening to a reggae version of that album, or tracks from it, at least.</p>
<p>But this is every track on what is famously a triple album. Yes, including &lsquo;Career Opportunities&rsquo; (though not, to be fair, &lsquo;Blowing in the Guns of Brixton&rsquo;). And the great thing about it is, almost no track is a carbon copy of the original. We get jazz instrumentals, ska versions, rocked-up versions of ones The Clash took slowly, and everything in between. Most of the performers are little known, or unknown, to me at least. But we get Katrina of Katrina and the Waves, Jon Langford of the Mekons, Wreckless Eric, The Coal Porters, and of course the aforementioned former Scorcher.</p>
<p>It is really, really good. Highly recommended if you&rsquo;re a fan, and even if you&rsquo;re not, I imagine you&rsquo;ll find something to enjoy. Go on, <a href="https://album.link/i/256099883">find it on your favourite service here</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I love that the label it&rsquo;s on is called 00:02:59 Records. &lsquo;The band went in/And knocked them dead/In two minutes fifty-nine,&rsquo; as &lsquo;Hitsville UK&rsquo; says.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

			 <p>Spoilers below.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784971540">This</a>  is a really strange book. I know it&rsquo;s probably cultural differences in storytelling style, and what have you. But there is something deeply odd about the way this is told. I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on what it is (and at least part of it will be to do with the translation).</p>
<p>At a plot and character level, one thing that surprised me is that when someone starts seeing unexpected visual effects — specifically, a countdown timer superimposed on the world around them — they don&rsquo;t ever seem to think that the explanation is they&rsquo;re actually in a simulation. That would seem like the logical first attempt at an explanation, given the recent history of SF and indeed discussions outside of it.</p>
<p>We never learn what was meant to happen at the end of the countdown. And (not connected to that) the character we&rsquo;re first sympathetic to betrays all of humanity!</p>
<p>I liked the early parts about the Cultural Revolution in China. They linked surprisingly well into my <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/10/13/of-all-the.html">recent <cite>Nineteen Eighty-Four</cite> deep dive</a>. Which is amusing because not long ago I read something about someone encouraging someone else to read this, where they said you just had to get past that part to really start enjoying it.</p>
<p>I did enjoy it, mind. I went right out and bought the sequels and have started <cite>The Dark Forest</cite>. I just find it weird. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://devilgate.org/2015/10/06/the-threebody-problem.html">actually a reread</a>, but it&rsquo;s nearly a decade since, and I only remembered two scenes.</p>

			 <h2 id="ministry-of-plenty">Ministry of Plenty</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2024. It&rsquo;s 40 years since 1984. So I guess that&rsquo;s why there have been a lot of things turning up that are related in one way or another to George Orwell&rsquo;s <cite>Nineteen Eighty-Four</cite><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s considerably more than forty years since the novel was published: more like 75 years. Which is a memorable enough number in itself.</p>
<p>At Worldcon in Glasgow in August, the last panel I went to was about the book. People discussing when they had first read it, how it had affected them, the effects it had on literature and culture more broadly, and so on.</p>
<p>Then a few weeks later the podcast of the BBC Radio 4 programme <cite>In Our Time</cite> dropped into my feed, with an episode about it. It was described as a &lsquo;summer repeat&rsquo;. I assume the programme is off the air but they like to keep the feed fed.  <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001bz77">It was originally broadcast in 2022</a>, so nothing to do with any anniversaries in this year, but no matter.</p>
<p>All of this served to remind me of two things: one, that it was high time I read it again. And two, since read it in my teenage years and never since, I had shamefully never quite read <em>all</em> of it. Because there&rsquo;s that bit in the middle where Winston is reading &lsquo;<cite>The Book</cite>&rsquo;, as it&rsquo;s called. And when you&rsquo;re fourteen or fifteen that can seem terribly dull and easily skippable.</p>
<p>Also at the convention<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I picked up a copy of Ken MacLeod&rsquo;s new collection, <cite>A Jura for Julia</cite>.  You might guess from the title that there&rsquo;s some sort of connection, what with Julia being the only female character in the original book, and Jura being where Orwell spent the last months of his life writing it.</p>
<p>And indeed, the collection is bookended by two connected stories comprising a sequel to Orwell&rsquo;s novel.</p>
<p>So I was going to revisit the original and then read Ken&rsquo;s stories. But I realised I didn&rsquo;t actually have a copy. I think I read it from the library all those years ago. We got our son a copy at some point, but that&rsquo;s either with him or in a box in the basement. So I decided just to buy a new one.</p>
<p>While I was in Foyles I noticed another connected work: <cite>Julia</cite> by Sandra Newman. I remembered reading about this when it came out and thinking I&rsquo;d like to read it. It&rsquo;s a retelling of the story of <cite>Nineteen Eighty-Four</cite>, from Julia&rsquo;s point of view. It came out last year, so I&rsquo;m sure author and publisher had anniversaries in mind, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<h2 id="not-forever">Not Forever</h2>
<p>So what about these books, then?</p>
<p>There are two things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_geography_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four">Ingsoc</a> got right, I mention in passing: going over properly to the metric system — which leads to the oddity of a prole barman who has never even heard of a pint — and going to full use of the twenty-four-hour clock, giving us that famously startling opening line about the clocks striking thirteen.</p>
<p>Not much else, though. It&rsquo;s a bit odd thinking about it now that the ideology is called &lsquo;<em>English</em> Socialism&rsquo; when the geopolitical bloc Airstrip One is part of, Oceania, is clearly dominated by America. The renaming of the UK makes that clear. And indeed, the switch to decimal measurements and twenty-four-hour time are even stranger, given how America in our world is the biggest holdout against those.</p>
<p>I suppose the &lsquo;English&rsquo; in &lsquo;Ingsoc&rsquo; could mean the language. But a socialism dominated by America? Something that calls itself socialism, at least: it&rsquo;s no more socialism than Germany&rsquo;s &lsquo;National Socialism&rsquo; was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before that I dislike dystopian fiction as genre or background to stories. I wonder if that dislike was caused in part by early inoculation with this work.  But what I found really weird about reading it after all these years is how weirdly <em>cosy</em> it all felt. Maybe it&rsquo;s just because I knew what happens; maybe because there are these sequels by other hands to consider; or it could be somehow inherent in the writing. But I had no real sense of bleakness, nor even of menace. Strange, really.</p>
<p>It is, of course, a tragedy, among other things. Winston and Julia know that they&rsquo;ll be caught by the Thought Police and taken to the Ministry of Love eventually; but they believe that, whatever they have to go through, there will be a core of them, deep in their hearts, that will survive, uncorrupted, undefeated. I was reminded of Evey, in Alan Moore and David Lloyd&rsquo;s <cite>V for Vendetta</cite>. About how you&rsquo;ll survive — maybe win — as long as they can never reach that last half inch of you (I write from probably inaccurate memory).</p>
<p>That turns out not to be true for Winston and Julia, as they each betray the other. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s assertion that &lsquo;We will empty you out and fill you up with us&rsquo; proves true; and the novel closes with Winston loving Big Brother. There is no hope. A boot stamping on a human face.</p>
<p>Except, then we get the appendix. It tells the story of Newspeak, and does so wholly in the past tense, describing plans the party had for the minimal, stripped-down language. How it was expected to limit the capability for thoughtcrime — for thought itself — in the populace forced to use it. But it is presented as if it were an academic work, part of a history of the Big Brother times in what was then called Airstrip One, and is now called Britain again.</p>
<p>Hope in an appendix. I like it.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-it-short">Keeping it Short</h2>
<p>So we come to the first sequel I want to speak of, which is composed of Ken MacLeod&rsquo;s two short stories. &lsquo;Nineteen Eighty-Nine&rsquo; picks up on Winston&rsquo;s story. He&rsquo;s taken from the Chestnut Tree café thinking he&rsquo;s finally going to be killed. But in fact it&rsquo;s the revolution. Big Brother and the party are overthrown. Winston is to be Minister of Truth in the new government.</p>
<p>And then in &lsquo;A Jura for Julia&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a decade or two later. Julia is a researcher in &lsquo;computational literature&rsquo;, mechanical writing. She used to be a mechanic who worked on the machines that created cheap novels for the proles. Now she&rsquo;s an academic studying the technology behind the machines. She travels to Jura because she has heard there is an important link there to the history of the machines. What she finds ties her story and Winston&rsquo;s together with Orwell&rsquo;s in a fascinating way.</p>
<h2 id="a-womans-perspective">A Woman&rsquo;s Perspective</h2>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Sandra Newman before <cite>Julia</cite>, but she&rsquo;s written several books, and been nominated for various awards. This one is authorised by Orwell&rsquo;s estate and tells the familiar story from Julia&rsquo;s perspective, expanding it both in worldbuilding, character, and time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a much richer story than Orwell&rsquo;s, in that Julia&rsquo;s character is dramatically expanded from the original, and we learn a great deal about the society, or the various societies that exist in Airstrip One. It&rsquo;s all well done, very convincing, and completely in keeping with the original. There&rsquo;s nothing added that couldn&rsquo;t have been imagined in Orwell&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Julia the character is not much more than a cipher in the original, and here she has a rich inner life, and is wonderfully and believably changeable.</p>
<p>One chapter opens with the line, &lsquo;She was in Love.&rsquo; Which jars you for a second, because the previous chapter ended with her and Winston&rsquo;s arrest. Till you remember that she refers to the ministries just by their key words: &lsquo;Truth&rsquo; for the Ministry of Truth, and so on.</p>
<p>It takes us to a an ending not so very different from MacLeod&rsquo;s but perhaps a more ambiguous one.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s enough <cite>Nineteen Eighty-Four</cite> for a while, and enough 1984, too, though it strikes me that the novel I&rsquo;m writing at the moment is set then. It&rsquo;s a year that still has a massive gravitational pull on the imagination.</p>

			 <p>If there&rsquo;s a record for the longest gap between volumes of a series of collections, I think we all know that there&rsquo;s only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dangerous_Visions">one real contender</a>. Though to win it, JMS&rsquo;s <cite>The Last Dangerous Visions</cite> will have to actually be released (which, at the time of writing, is scheduled to happen next month, amazingly).</p>
<p>Second on the list, though, might be <cite><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781915556431">Nova Scotia</a></cite>. The <a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/novascotiarev.htm">first volume</a> was published in 2005, to more-or-less coincide with the second Glasgow Worldcon. Nineteen years later all is well, as Volume 2 is published to more-or-less coincide with this year&rsquo;s Glasgow Worldcon.</p>
<p>And it is again, very good, and very varied. I&rsquo;m not going to go through the stories, but it struck me that three of them concern someone being resurrected — woken from cryogenic stasis, or reconstructed from DNA and memories — in a future that might not be quite what they had expected or hoped for. A couple of others include bringing back extinct species, or sentient life coming to entities that are not (to the best of our knowledge) sentient at present.</p>
<p>I doubt the stories were chosen deliberately to have those connections. Rather, perhaps this is how our current end-of-the-world fears are playing out: in fantasies of technological afterlives. Not that such stories are particularly new, but maybe they&rsquo;re particularly <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>Notable contributors: Ken McLeod, of course, Scotland&rsquo;s premier living SF author. James Kelman, surprisingly: as one of Scotland&rsquo;s best-known <em>literary</em> authors, it&rsquo;s pleasing that he&rsquo;d lower himself into our genre murk. Grant Morrison, Scotland&rsquo;s best known comics writer, I imagine. And plenty others.</p>

			 <p>I saw Tendai (as is his name) interviewed at Worldcon last month. Went along without knowing anything about him or his writing, and the interview was interesting enough that I went and bought <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529039481">this</a> in the dealers' room immediately afterwards. Or maybe the next day, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first of the <cite>Edinburgh Nights</cite> series, which I think is currently at three books with a fourth on the way and a fifth planned. Which means it kind of violates one of my personal guidelines to have bought it, but what the hell, you know?</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s set in an alternative Edinburgh where there&rsquo;s magic. The time is approximately the present day, because there&rsquo;s things like smartphones. But our heroine, Ropa, can talk to ghosts, which tend to hang about when they&rsquo;ve got unfinished business back on the plane of the living.</p>
<p>And a whole lot more happens besides. It&rsquo;s a pretty bleak environment that she lives in, essentially a shanty town of caravans on the edge of the city, very much hand to mouth. It feels kind of post-apocalypse, but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s been anything quite as disastrous as that, just a slow decline. Not sure, though, there are hints at things. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see where he takes it.</p>
<p>As far as the &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t start a series that the author hasn&rsquo;t finished writing&rsquo; guideline goes, it&rsquo;s pretty standalone, thought with plenty of setup for more.</p>

			 <p>I mentioned in the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/09/03/finished-reading-death.html">last books post</a> that I&rsquo;ve seen the Jackson Brodie TV series. Well, maybe not all of them. I enjoyed the latest book in the series so much that I thought I&rsquo;d go back and read the earlier ones. <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780385671316">This is the first</a>, and the story was completely unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>It was also surprisingly horrific. It starts by setting up three &lsquo;case histories&rsquo;, with three stories of crimes at different times in the past: a young girl disappears; a young woman is murdered; another young woman murders her husband.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re introduced to Jackson Brodie: divorced and trying to co-parent a young daughter and carry on his life, while also trying to run a private detective agency in Cambridge, a city he hates.</p>
<p>Somehow, all these cases are going to come together and get solved. As I said about the latest book, though, it&rsquo;s clear that Atkinson&rsquo;s writing about the minutiae of the human heart, far more than the minutiae of detective work. And that&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an enjoyable, easy read — well, apart from the gruesomeness and tension of the first three chapters — and intriguingly it ends as if Brodie&rsquo;s career is over. I don&rsquo;t know if she planned to write sequels, but clearly something must change.</p>

			 <p><img src="uploads/2025/c09622492d.jpg"/></p> <p>It's a comedy, but I have to say, I find very little humour in it. Especially not the first half.</p><p>Certainly there's farce: moving Stalin's body around, all that. But the terror, the killings, the torture, the rape: none of it shown, exactly, but all right there in front of you. It's mostly just too fucking <em>serious</em> for me to laugh at it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve read several of Kate Atkinson&rsquo;s books, but never one of her Jackson Brodie detective series. This despite having seen the TV adaptations. So getting <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780385548007">this</a> as a birthday present was great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re promised a murder mystery set against the background of a country house hosting a murder-mystery party, and that&rsquo;s what we get, eventually. I really enjoyed it, but if anything I&rsquo;d like her to spend more time with the titular detective.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But we get various viewpoint characters, and really very little from Brodie&rsquo;s viewpoint. Very little actual detecting, too.</p>
<p>Indeed, I got the impression that Atkinson doesn&rsquo;t really <em>want</em> to be writing a detective story. Or she does, of course, but she&rsquo;s so keen on multiple viewpoints and character creation — and so good at them — that those are the things she&rsquo;s doing, more than writing a conventional story of a detective solving a mystery.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with that, of course, you can tell any story you want, any way you want, and why be bound by conventions?</p>

			 <p>When the final chronicles were first announced, and indeed on the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/08/18/the-runes-of.html">first</a> <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/09/19/fatal-revenant-the.html">two</a> books, it was referred to as a trilogy. I assume that the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/08/16/finished-reading-against.html">third</a> volume just became so long that the publishers, and probably Donaldson himself, decided it needed to be split in two. Each of the third and <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780575108325">fourth</a> volumes is about the same length, anyway.</p>
<p>And they bring everything to a satisfying conclusion, that&rsquo;s the main thing. Of course Linden hesitates, and Covenant resists using wild magic (but not to the extent he once did). Of course Donaldson uses fifty words where fifteen would do. Of course his writerly tics come through.</p>
<p>But the pages keep turning, and old friends and enemies turn up, and Wild Magic, Law, and Earthpower do their things, and we all leave satisfied.</p>

			 <p><img src="uploads/2025/70a4518193.jpg"/></p> <p>We've been watching the old &lt;cite&gt;Poirot&lt;/cite&gt; TV series, inspired by me getting the book this film is based on <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/12/27/murder-on-the.html" rel="nofollow">last Christmas<a rel="nofollow">. More on the series later, perhaps, but it drops in quality in later seasons, when the production company changes.</a></a></p><p>And in season 12 it does &lt;cite&gt;Murder on the Orient Express&lt;/cite&gt;; and it frankly does quite a bad job of it. Not least in the suddenly-Catholic Poirot's struggle with his conscience. </p><p>Having him struggling with his conscience over his decision at the end isn't automatically a bad thing. But in the context of the series, it's just not the same character as earlier.</p><p>However, we're talking about the 1974 Sidney Lumet film version here. It's no more than OK. If you didn't know the story maybe it would be better, but I'm not sure. It's quite a stellar cast, and most of the individual parts are played well, but in the end it all just comes out as not very good. </p><p>Maybe the source material is to blame. Or more likely, the setting. It's like a bottle episode, in that it almost entirely takes place on the train. That maybe doesn't lend itself well to good cinema.</p>

			 <p>You will, I think, be far from surprised to learn that <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780356206523">this</a> is a reread. At least the third read, in fact. I suggested it as a possibility for my book club, and when it wasn&rsquo;t chosen I decided it was time anyway.</p>
<p>There are still books that should be in <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a> that I&rsquo;ve only read once: <cite>Stonemouth</cite> and <cite>The Quarry</cite>. But I&rsquo;ll get to those eventually.</p>
<p>One oddity about <cite>The Crow Road</cite> is that I&rsquo;ve never blogged about it before. Yet I&rsquo;ve loved it since I first read the opening line, at a convention in Glasgow in 1992, if memory serves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just read the opening line and you&rsquo;ll buy it,&rsquo; my friend Steve said, when I was hesitant about shelling out the huge £10 price for the hardback. I had already read all of Banks&rsquo;s earlier books, so I was definitely planning on getting it, but waiting for the paperback was the norm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was the day my grandmother exploded.&rsquo; Steve was right. I bought it, and all he subsequent books, in hardback.</p>
<p>Memory does serve, but not all that well: <a href="https://devilgate.org/2013/06/17/forgot-the-cry.html">I&rsquo;ve written all that before</a>, it turns out, after Banksie died. Though it remains slightly unclear which convention it was that year.</p>
<p>A book is more than its opening line, though. <cite>The Crow Road</cite> is a family drama, set mostly in a fictional Scottish town not far from where I grew up. Also in Glasgow, a non-fictional city where the titular road exists. The metaphorical one is everywhere, of course: it means death, in the vernacular of that exploding grandmother.</p>
<p>I read it with more of a writerly eye this time, I think, and I wondered whether the structural games really add anything to the whole. I don&rsquo;t mean the parts that are effectively speculative: the main character, Prentice McHoan, trying to work out what might have happened to his missing uncle. Nor the flashbacks in third-person, when the main narrative is in first. That makes sense, as they&rsquo;re showing us Prentice&rsquo;s childhood, or things that happened to other family members when Prentice wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more thinking about a couple of flashes forward, that hint about where the main narrative is going to go. They aren&rsquo;t enough to really make the reader speculate, and they happen when we&rsquo;re already well into the story, so they aren&rsquo;t needed to make us keep going.</p>
<p>They  do no harm, though, and maybe Banksie needed to use them to keep his own interest up. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with them, or that.</p>
<p>I do find it hard to explain why this book is so compelling. I think it&rsquo;s probably his best non-SF book. It&rsquo;s probably not quite my favourite, though it&rsquo;s up there. I&rsquo;ve long thought it was partly cultural for me, in that the characters and locations feel like people and places I knew growing up. But that can&rsquo;t explain its broader appeal.</p>
<p>I guess Banksie was just a great writer.</p>

			 <p>I seem to have largely stopped blogging. Certainly, as a general election approaches, I&rsquo;ve written nothing publicly about politics.</p>
<p>Consider: in just over a week we could be rid of this appalling Tory government. The Labour one we get in its place (or, just possibly, a coalition) will probably not be much to write home about, but even if its policies are far from perfect, its plans to tax the rich and invest in the country&rsquo;s infrastructure far weaker than I&rsquo;d like: things can hardly be worse.</p>
<p>Indeed, they can only get better, right?</p>
<p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/01/18/i-joined-the.html">saw Keir Starmer speak at the Fabian Society</a> a few years back. 2020, surprisingly, but January, before the pandemic really got going. He came across there as a thoroughly good and decent, left-wing, progressive guy. I can&rsquo;t remember anything he said specifically, but it was positive, you know?</p>
<p>Now, he&rsquo;s generally seen as timid, scared of appearing to be too left-wing, that sort of thing, or worse. While at the same time seemingly fierce at purging the left of the party. And poor on women&rsquo;s rights, to say nothing of his dealings with women MPs and candidates.</p>
<p>Still, after the shitshow of the last few years, I&rsquo;ll accept competence, as long as it&rsquo;s not right-wing competence.</p>

It&rsquo;s the story of a financier around the time of the Wall Street Crash in the 1920s, told from four different points of view. Which one do we trust? (See what he did with the title?)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good, but nowhere near as good as the praise heaped upon it by reviewers, as quoted all over the cover, would suggest.</p>

			 <p>The latest bookclub book. Kincaid&rsquo;s brother died in 1996 of AIDS. Kincaid herself was estranged from her family for 20 years, so she saw her brother when he was three, and then again when he was 33, and dying.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529077094">this</a> is more about her than about him. She looks at feelings towards her birth family: does she love her brother? Does she love her mother? &lsquo;No&rsquo; is her conclusion for both. But she examines different kinds of love, different ways of loving.</p>
<p>Parts of it are kind of like cubist art in a way: examining the same place, person, or event, at different times, in the way the cubists would try to show a subject from different angles at the same time.</p>
<p>The writing flows very smoothly despite some impressively- if not excessively-long sentences.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I got <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781786897077">this</a> as a Christmas present from my beloved. I had no idea who Courttia Newland is. I assumed it was a woman, at first. It&rsquo;s not, and it turns out I had experienced some of his work already, as he wrote some of the scripts for Steve McQueen&rsquo;s <cite>Small Axe</cite>  series of films; specifically <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/01/26/lovers-rock.html"><cite>Lover&rsquo;s Rock</cite>,</a>  <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/02/07/red-white-and.html"><cite>Red, White and Blue</cite></a> , and <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/03/06/education.html"><cite>Education</cite></a> . (I wouldn&rsquo;t bother clicking those links, it looks like I didn&rsquo;t write anything about them.)</p>
<p>I started the novel without reading any reviews or anything about it other than the blurb and quotes on the cover. The key one of those is this, from the <cite>Observer</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A vast and wildly ambitious piece of speculative fiction that asks what the world would look like if slavery and colonialism never existed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which set me up with some expectations. Sensibly, Newland doesn&rsquo;t make this imagined world a utopia. Far from it, in fact. The world in which the protagonist, Markriss, finds himself, is pretty grim.</p>
<p>And to my mind, at least at first, the only thing in-universe that tells us about the absence of colonialism, etc, is skin colour is never mentioned. Yes, the world is different from our own, and it turns out (reading around the novel) a major reason is, instead of the weird monotheism of Judaeo-Christianity-Islam having the major religious impact on world history, African religions have the biggest influence.</p>
<p>What this means for our hero is he can have an out-of-body experience and it not exactly be unexpected.</p>
<p>Which takes us into the whole out-of-this-world part of this novel. All those blurbs talk about it as a novel of decolonisation and so on, which is fine. But that&rsquo;s because Newland has a mainstream, literary reputation — he has published several previous novels. <em>This</em>, though is a genre work. Science fiction, you might say, or fantasy, looked at from another direction.</p>
<p>And what nothing prepares you for (well, the reviews do, but I didn&rsquo;t want to read them first) is that this is a multiverse story. Because Markriss&rsquo;s ability to leave his body in his astral form develops to the point where he can do so permanently; and then drop back down into a different tributary of the titular river.</p>
<p>This puts him in an alternative version of himself: another timeline. Some have very similar events and experiences; some are very different, such as one that doesn&rsquo;t look at all removed from our own. He always has some of the people closest to him, though their relationships vary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s effective and accomplished, but it can be unsatisfying. Because, when he leaves a timeline, he leaves its story incomplete. We don&rsquo;t know what happened to the first version of Markriss, or the second, or…</p>
<p>Sometimes the language, the linguistic style, can be confusing. But it feels like a positive sort of confusion, the kind that stretches your mind.</p>
<p>On the whole, I enjoyed it.</p>

			 <p><img src="uploads/2025/b00e956b8a.jpg"/></p> <p>To the IMAX at Waterloo last Sunday, with a group of fellow writers from the Spectrum group. &lt;a href=“<a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/02/22/dune.html" rel="nofollow"> https://devilgate.org/2024/02/22/dune.html</a>”&gt;As I said, I wasn't that impressed when I watched part 1 on Netflix. Still, this would be wholly different, not least because of it being on a giant screen.</p><p>Which was true enough. That screen is almost too big, certainly when you're sitting in row G and there's a closeup: Timothée Chalamet's face shouldn't be gigantic! Luckily there weren't too many of those occasions.</p><p>More to the point, this a spectacular movie, in the literal sense: it's all about the spectacle. And there's plenty of that. Battles, explosions, sandworms, duels.</p><p>And it's all a bit… not that good really, I thought. I liked parts of it. But really disliked the overall narrative arc. As I said last time, I remember the book hardly at all. So the transition of Paul Atriedes from teen duke trying to find his way with the Fremen, to world leader and messiah figure challenging the galactic emperor himself? Frankly, I don't buy it, and I didn't like it.</p><p>My favourite moment was Chani (Zendaya) turning away and walking out when everyone else bowed down to him. In fact in acting terms Zendaya is the best thing about this film. She can express so much just with her face, it was incredible.</p><p>Of course that ability might have been exaggerated by her face being the size of a bus, but no one else was doing that.</p><p>The worst thing about it in a ways was that it didn't feel like the end brought us to a conclusion. It felt like the middle volume of a trilogy. And I'm quite sure the original book didn't feel like that. I know there are several sequels, but I don't believe it was written as the start of a series. It was a self-contained work.</p><p>In fact I started the second one, &lt;cite&gt;Dune Messiah&lt;/cite&gt; (and yes, that title should have given me some clues to the above complaints) all those years ago, and couldn't get into it. Didn't finish it.</p><p>The odd thing about all this is that it makes me slightly want to go back and read the book (and maybe carry on this time).</p><p>Anyway, there we are. There had do be someone who didn't think it's the best thing since freshly-baked baguette.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read several of Keenan&rsquo;s books before, and enjoyed them, but found them strange. This one is composed of three or four different narratives. They&rsquo;re interlinked, or at least interconnected, but they&rsquo;re very different.</p>
<p>A love story in France of a few years ago about someone who is studying cathedrals (sort of); a historical story about the Siege of Khartoum; a far-future science-fiction story supposedly written by two of the characters in one of the other sections.</p>
<p>And so on. It will bear rereading, I imagine, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll dedicate the time. I started it just before Christmas and finished it this morning. With a few other books in between, but still.</p>

<p>spaghetti but thicker and with a hole in it, meaning it absorbs 200 percent more sauce than its thinner, hole-free brethren, due to math.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rereading the article now, I had forgotten that she did a whole investigation about the shortage, writing it as if it were about a grave conspiracy, and hoping she might be called &lsquo;the Bernstein of Bucatini&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So what of it?</p>
<p>It was… fine, I guess? Like spaghetti, but thicker.</p>
<p>But I fear we might not be getting the real thing. From the photograph accompanying the article, the hole through the noodles looks quite substantial. Whereas in the packet we have — the brand being Tesco Finest — the hole is quite narrow. The <cite>New York</cite> photo might be exaggerating the holiness, but I suspect we&rsquo;re being fobbed off over here, with fakeatini.</p>
<p>Certainly there&rsquo;s no way it collected three times the sauce that standard spaghetti does.</p>
<p>Of course, if you go back to my picture from the other day you&rsquo;ll see that the packet describes it as &lsquo;<strong>Spaghetti</strong>&rsquo; in big letters, with &lsquo;bucatini&rsquo; underneath, in much smaller type, like a subtitle.</p>
<p>Maybe, rather than a fake, we have a hybrid.</p>

			 <p>First, a disclaimer: the author of <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781787612747">this book</a> was on the same Creative Writing MA as me, and I read a prerelease PDF that she sent me.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s a really good young-adult fantasy story set in the real world, present day.</p>
<p>Or I think &lsquo;middle grade&rsquo; is the sort of level it&rsquo;s marketed towards. The main character, Saffi, is about 12. Her younger brother is maybe eight or ten. Their mum has died tragically young and their dad takes them from London to live with their grandparents in a B&amp;B by the sea in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>The titular house has been in the family for generations, and it has A History. The kids hate it at first, but Saffi tries to adjust and to keep her brother&rsquo;s spirits up. She is helped by a slightly mysterious local boy they meet.</p>
<p>And then a group of guests arrive at the B&amp;B. In the middle of the night. Without coming through the door.</p>
<p>Things get stranger after that. Will Saffi and Milo save the family&rsquo;s legacy, themselves, and their new friend&rsquo;s home, from the plans of these powerful figures out of myth and fairytale? Only by reading will you find out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great. Get it for your kids.</p>

			 <p>In <a href="https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/02/03/ten-blue-links-for-3rd-feb-2024/#1a79a958-71e8-46b9-a4fa-d6519eae97f6">the lone footnote of his latest post</a>, Ian Betteridge bemoans the use of the term &lsquo;users&rsquo; for people making use of software:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve always hated calling people users rather than customers. You owe “users” nothing. You owe your customers everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember seeing this complaint years ago. &lsquo;Why do we refer to people with a term that comes from the illegal drugs trade?&rsquo; was a common refrain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, people taking illegal drugs <em>are</em> sometimes referred to as &lsquo;users&rsquo;. But only really in 70s cop shows. I grew up on <cite>Starsky &amp; Hutch</cite> and <cite>Kojak</cite> as much as the next guy my age, but I don&rsquo;t look to them for appropriate linguistic terms today.</p>
<p>More to the point, the term &lsquo;user&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t <em>come</em> from the drug trade, it <em>went to</em> it. The term just comes from the English language: from the verb &lsquo;to use&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Anyone who uses any item is a &lsquo;user&rsquo; of that item. If I cut a slice of bread, I&rsquo;m a user of the bread knife. If I go into the garden to gather the still-uncollected autumn leaves, I&rsquo;m a user of the rake. And so on.</p>
<p>Ian prefers the term &lsquo;customer&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s fair enough if you bought the item in question. But he also writes about using <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, which is a piece of software that is available at no cost. I use it every day, but I&rsquo;m not a customer of the people who make it. Ian may pay them, as it&rsquo;s possible to do for certain features, or just to support them. But there are plenty of examples of software for which that is not the case. It&rsquo;s just free. You&rsquo;re not a customer of Linus Torvalds when you use Linux, for example.</p>
<p>Anyway, my feelings are almost the opposite: being a <em>user</em> — or a <em>reader</em> or a <em>listener</em> or <em>viewer</em>, for that matter — is the truth, is the state that has power, has meaning. Not the tawdry commercial act, the mere fact of when or whether we bought a thing.</p>

<p>If Apple needed a general-purpose language for configuration, why did they invent their own, rather than using Terraform, say?</p>
<p>But then, this Pkl (‘Pickle’) seems a lot more expressive than Terraform, and a lot more down-to-Earth and less cloudy.</p>

			 <p>I can see why <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781324064831">this</a> won the Booker <strike>last year</strike> the year before last. It&rsquo;s beautifully written, with a kind of light, easy style. And yet it goes to some very, very dark places.</p>
<p>The titular Maali is dead at the start, finds himself in the afterlife, and doesn&rsquo;t know how he died. He&rsquo;s given seven days — the &lsquo;moons&rsquo; of the title — to find out, or not, before he has to decide whether or not to go into &lsquo;The Light&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There are ghosts, ghouls, demons, and horrors. Most of the latter two are living humans, because we&rsquo;re in Sri Lanka&rsquo;s civil war, and Maali was a photographer who photographed the horrors. Many of the dead he meets died in atrocities, and they&rsquo;re not shy about sharing their stories.</p>
<p>I can highly recommend this, but not if you&rsquo;ll be too disturbed by stories of atrocities. So think of this as a content warning.</p>

			 <p>Back in 2021, when I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/03/30/how-to-write.html">read Chee&rsquo;s <cite>How to Write an Autobiographical Novel</cite></a>, I expressed an interest in this book, <cite>Edinburgh</cite>, largely because of its title. As I said then, &lsquo;the Edinburgh connection in the novel didn’t survive the writing and editing process, but he kept the title anyway.&rsquo; There is, in fact, a tangential character in this who has a loose connection to the city, but it&rsquo;s not relevant.</p>
<p>What we have is a <em>bildungsroman</em>, the story of a boy becoming a man, knowing he&rsquo;s gay from an early age, and going through various experiences both because of that fact and having nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>But about halfway through, the first-person narrative switches to a different character&rsquo;s first-person narrative, which caused me some confusion. The sections are headed with the name of the narrator, but since there is only this one change, then a change back for the last quarter, it wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious what was going on.</p>
<p>That was OK though. What I didn&rsquo;t enjoy so much was a kind of allusiveness that really became vagueness, which at times made it slightly hard to see what he was getting at. Especially in the last quarter.</p>
<p>And that last quarter is the most difficult and problematic part of the whole. See, early on, the first narrator is abused, along with several classmates, by a teacher. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much effect on the narrator, though it does on some of the other victims.</p>
<p>But in the end the main narrator becomes an abuser himself; of the other narrator, who is linked to the whole story in a way that is, frankly, too coincidental. And it all ends in a kind of unresolved ambiguity which I found left a bad taste.</p>
<p>All in all, I preferred his nonfiction.</p>

			 <p><img src="uploads/2025/06d2ecf532.jpg"/></p> <p><em>This review may contain spoilers.</em></p> <p>It's unusual to go in to see a film with essentially no idea of what it's about. Unusual, but sometimes quite a good way to approach something. I think I had read something to the effect that someone was invited to someone's country home. But as far as that, I knew nothing about this, going into the cinema today.</p><p>Except, maybe, that there was some major surprise twist or reversal.</p><p>There are, in fact, no surprises in this.</p><p>Or let's say, I found nothing particularly surprising in it.</p><p>I enjoyed it, and had a good conversation about it afterwards. But it would have been better — the conversation afterwards in particular — if the the first twenty minutes and the last five were shaved off.</p><p>The first twenty minutes because, we know: Oxford is shit if you have no friends and no money; and it's better if you have both. We don't need it explained in elaborate detail.</p><p>Or maybe that's not so obvious. I have some insider knowledge there.</p><p>But the last five or so minutes. I mean, really? Do you have to explain everything? Spell everything out in minute detail? Confirm that every possible thing that we thought might have happened — but that was, until now, pleasingly ambiguous — had actually happened?</p><p>I feel like the ending was focus-grouped to death; a few people didn't understand, so they dropped in some tiny flashbacks. Yes, he <em>was</em> that manipulative. I had suspected that from about forty minutes in, and my suspicions only increased. But I'd rather have had them left as suspicions.</p><p>All that said, I enjoyed this a lot. I just feel I could have enjoyed it a lot more.</p><p>---</p>

			 <p>The first Christmas-present book, finished on boxing day.  Short, and a page-turner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read an Agatha Christie before, perhaps surprisingly. I&rsquo;m not even sure I&rsquo;ve seen any significant adaptation, except I once caught the end of one. Of this novel, unfortunately. So I sort of knew what the conclusion was, which meant I was seeing how the clues pointed in that direction.</p>
<p>No matter, it&rsquo;s still a great read, and makes me want to read more.</p>

			 <p>I suppose I should tell you what I thought of the three <cite>Doctor Who</cite> 60th anniversary specials.</p>
<p>They were good. Not great, but good. My favourite of the three — and I think probably the best, too — was the middle one, &lsquo;Wild Blue Yonder&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As to the ending, the &lsquo;bi-generation&rsquo; thing was daft, but fun. It was good to give the leaving and arriving Doctors the chance to interact, and a Doctor ending without it being a death was good.</p>
<p>However, let us speak of the extension of that effect, as explained in <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/doctor-who-bigeneration-doctorverse-newsupdate/">this <cite>Radio Times</cite> article</a>. I was directed there by <a href="https://micro.blog/BenSouthwood">@BenSouthwood</a>, via a <a href="https://bensouthwood.me/2023/12/09/doctor-who-was.html">conversation on Micro.blog</a>.</p>
<p>As I said there, I loved the idea of the Timeless Child, and the expansion it brought to The Doctor&rsquo;s past and the prehistory of the Time Lords. But this &lsquo;every Doctor is now bi-generated&rsquo; idea just seems like it leaves things in a mess.</p>
<p>Sure, you can explain it all away with branching timelines, alternative realities and all that. But it all just seems a bit too chaotic, you know? Even if they never use it, it feels unnecessary.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this idea of making an expanded &lsquo;Whoniverse&rsquo;, in the vein of what Marvel and <cite>Star Wars</cite> have become. Disney&rsquo;s money is going to allow this, presumably. More shows, even, than when we had <cite>Torchwood</cite> and <cite>The Sarah Jane Adventures</cite>.</p>
<p>Trouble is, from my point of view, that I&rsquo;ve lost interest in both <cite>Star Wars</cite> and Marvel exactly because there&rsquo;s <em>so much stuff</em>. It&rsquo;s all just too much.</p>
<p>So I hope my favourite programme doesn&rsquo;t go the same way. Or at least, if it does, that the original programme will always remain at the hearts of the franchise, and not depend on any of the expansion packs.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had this book for years, and I thought I had read it. Took a look at it a week or two back and realised I hadn&rsquo;t. So I did.</p>
<p>What I also didn&rsquo;t realise was that it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://christopher-priest.co.uk/books/the-dream-archipelago">Dream Archipelago</a> story. Which is surprising, since it starts in present-day (1980s) London. In fact it&rsquo;s the <a href="https://christopher-priest.co.uk/books/the-affirmation">first novel</a> (though not, I think, the first story) to use the Dream Archipelago as a setting, or state of mind.</p>
<p>Peter Sinclair suffers various crises in his personal life, and decides to write an autobiography to better understand himself. Through various revisions his writing becomes more fictionalised, until he&rsquo;s writing about the islands. Or living in them. Is it alternative world or madness? Portal fantasy or mental breakdown?</p>
<p>Or maybe both, or neither. You could argue that as a story it doesn&rsquo;t entirely make sense, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d go there. I mean, I&rsquo;d go <em>there</em>, to the Archipelago, for sure (it feels a lot like Greece to me, and indeed Sinclair and his ex/not-ex girlfriend met there, we are told).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a novel that leaves you questioning its realities, and maybe your own. And that seems like a good thing to me.</p>

			 <p>In a way it was surprising that Shane MacGowan survived this long, considering his noted and dramatic habits. But it&rsquo;s still sad that he&rsquo;s died.</p>
<p>I count The Pogues as one of the bands I&rsquo;ve seen live most of all. The only other one that comes close would be The Fall, and either could be the winner. Goes back to 1985, either way.</p>
<p>The Pogues were vey much a band of supremely talented musicians and songwriters. But Shane was the driving force. What they did was to meld punk with Irish folk music. The former, of course had helped me through my adolescent years and would remain a lifelong love. The latter: well, I came from a Scottish Catholic background, so it was pretty familiar, between Scottish folk and Irish songs sung at Celtic matches.</p>
<p>So on the instant that I first heard them — certainly on Peel, and probably &lsquo;Sally MacLennane&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d say — they clicked. There was no learning curve, no adjustment to this new sound. It was just <em>there</em>, it belonged, as if it had always existed.</p>
<p>The Pogues may have been inevitable, but Shane was a genius. And his songs, as I <a href="https://devilgate.micro.blog/2014/03/13/some-people-left.html">wrote when Phil Chevron died</a> were steeped in death imagery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with a couple of excellent screen grabs from Twitter (where, just to note, as I write, &lsquo;Sodomy and the Lash&rsquo; is trending under a &lsquo;food&rsquo; heading, which is just beyond weird.</p>
<p>First, this excellent mashups of the day&rsquo;s deaths of noted figures:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/imagegardentrax/status/1730209566124544462"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://devilgate.org/uploads/2023/screenshot-2023-11-30-at-15.09.26.png" alt="A tweet saying 'i'll remember Shane MacGowan for his staid, unflashy fiscal stewardship during the late New Labour years, Henry Kissinger for his wildcat drinking and visionary balladeering, and Alastair Darling for his crimes against the people of Cambodia and Laos'" title="Tweet about Shane's death, with Alistair Darling and Henry Kissinger in the mix" border="0"  /></a></p>
<p>And this typically topical &lsquo;Fairytale&rsquo; reference (even if it does misspell his surname):</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LMAsaysno/status/1730200197630705674"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://devilgate.org/uploads/2023/screenshot-2023-11-30-at-15.32.48.png" alt="A tweet saying 'fair play to shane macgowen for tapping out exactly one day before the fairy tale of new york discourse starts  RIP'" title="Tweet about the timeliness of Shane's death" border="0"  /></a></p>

			 <p>Why did nobody ever tell me that this book is funny? I had it in my head as a slightly worthy, if much-loved, courtroom drama. But the trial is only part of it, and quite small part at that. Though its ramifications play out to the end, and echo back to near the start.</p>
<p>Scout is an endearing narrator, wise beyond her years, tough, smart. Lee conjures a believable, well-formed picture of life in small-town Alabama in the thirties. A place of community and friendship, gossip and criticism, poverty and hard work. And a few people, notably Atticus, of course, willing to do the right thing in the face of dangerous racist neighbours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s intriguing, from a writer&rsquo;s perspective, how the narrative voice changes in the courtroom scenes when they do come.</p>
<p>And Boo Radley gave the band their name. I don&rsquo;t think I knew that, or if I did I&rsquo;d forgotten.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need me to tell you it&rsquo;s a classic, and it turns out, for good reason.</p>

<p>The titular Sarah is a woman described as ‘ugly’ who turns up in the camp of some Chinese men who are working on railroads in the USA of the 1870s. She speaks no known human language, though she does make sounds. She gains her name later because, a character says, ‘she sings like an angel’. One of the men, a young man called Chin, is volunteered to try to find where she belongs, or failing that, at least get rid of her, so she stops distracting them.</p>
<p>So begins a trek across the Pacific Northwest and beyond. Along the ways we meet various characters with various good and bad qualities.</p>
<p>The ending is, as I say, ambiguous. We never find out who or what Sarah Canary is. But the journey is quite enjoyable.</p>

			 <p>I picked this up because of the title, taken as it obviously is from an early song by <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/the-clash/">my favourite band</a>. I bought it because it is set in and around the famous anti-Nazi festival in Victoria Park in London. Or at least it starts there.</p>
<p>Though that&rsquo;s not quite true. It starts even closer to home for me: my kids' primary school is mentioned early on, and many other streets, pubs, takeaways and landmarks that still exist are visited.</p>
<p>Joe Thomas was born in 1977, so he&rsquo;s doing this from research, not memory, but it captures the area very well, and the time — well, from what I know of those times in London, I think he&rsquo;s done a great job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not mainly about the music scene, though. Thomas is a crime writer, and this is, kind of, a crime novel. And becomes more so as it goes on, and jumps to 1983. As you might imagine, given the notoriety of Stoke Newington Police Station of the time, it&rsquo;s about bent coppers. And one more-or-less decent cop who is — we think — trying to bring them down.</p>
<p>I say &lsquo;We think&rsquo;, because it&rsquo;s not finished. It turns out it&rsquo;s the start of a trilogy, with <cite>Red Menace</cite> and <cite>True Blue</cite> to follow. This one was only published this year, so I guess it&rsquo;ll be a while before we see the followups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all pretty good. It uses a slightly odd, cut-up sort of style: half sentences, fragments ending in dashes. But it&rsquo;s very readable. As I say, I was drawn to it by the music and the locations, but I enjoyed spending time with the characters, and the situation is compelling. Real life events are stitched into fictional ones (or vice-versa).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, then, it&rsquo;s a very political book. And surprisingly Thatcher turns up as a character. I&rsquo;m not sure why Thomas choose to do that. Maybe since most of the characters are on the left, it was to provide some sort of balance. Why not go as far up and right as possible, I suppose. I don&rsquo;t mean Thatcher is the furthest-right person in it, to be fair: the National Front are heavily involved, too.</p>
<p>The main police character is running &lsquo;spycops&rsquo;, and has operatives inside both the NF and the loose coalition of groups that oppose them (the Anti-Nazi League, Rock Against Racism, the Socialist Workers' Party). I expect as the series goes on we&rsquo;ll see some version of the scandals around that whole business, too.</p>

There's a central character who's obviously based on Bowie, another who's mostly Iggy Pop. Various others take elements of Lou Reed, Marc Bolan, and so on.</p><p>The music is a mixture of actual music from the time and specially-written tracks. The performers in the bands appearing on-stage and on the soundtrack are impressive: Thom Yorke and Johnny Greenwod, Thurston Moore, Bernard Butler, Ron Asheton, and more.</p><p>But the story is thin, and overall it's kind of boring. Apart from the songs, the main interest for me was in looking for parallels to the real people. Which is not really enough to sustain a film.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s slightly surprising, perhaps, that I&rsquo;ve never seen this horror
classic, given my sometime, occasional, interest in the genre. But then,
it wasn&rsquo;t available or was hard to get in the UK for the core years
when I might have seen it.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s on iPlayer just now, so I rectified the situation.</p>
<p>Except I almost didn&rsquo;t get past the first ten minutes. Honestly, I was
so bored with the slow, tedious Iraq-set grave-robbing scene  <em>that has
nothing to do with the rest of the story!</em></p>
<p>And the film as a whole is weirdly fragmentary, disjointed after that,
at least for the first half.</p>
<p>Then the last third is just one big advert for the Catholic church.
Though I would note that the exorcism fails, the old exorcist is killed
offscreen (and weirdly, he turns out to be the archaeologist/grave
robber from the start).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the self-sacrifice of the doubting Jesuit Father Karras, that gets
the demon out of the girl. His ending is one of the bravest things I&rsquo;ve
ever seen in a film. And those steps were the scariest thing in this
film.</p>
<p>Presumably the necklace/coin-like artefact that somehow made its way
from Iraq was supposed to have had something to do with allowing the
demon into the girl, but no use or sense of that was made in the story.</p>
<p>Decent effects. good makeup, and a great performance from Linda Blair
(if slightly wooden performances from most of the rest of the cast)
leave this as just OK, and far from the classic of its repute.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, of course.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not Nolan&rsquo;s best, and I&rsquo;m not sure it entirely makes sense. But it was better, and easier to understand, than I&rsquo;d been led to believe. Of course, I was watching it at home, with subtitles on, so that always helps with making out mumblecore actors.</p>
<p>But the time-flipping: I realise it&rsquo;s well thought-out, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s quite well thought out <em>enough</em>. A second watch might give me clarity on that, but unlike say <cite>Interstellar</cite> or <cite>Inception</cite>, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d particularly want to watch this again any time soon.</p>
<p>Which, since I&rsquo;m realising that as I write it, surely means half a star off?</p>

<p>This one is a historical novel based on the true story of the Mirabal sisters, three women from the Dominican Republic who were assassinated for political activism by the regime of the dictator Trujillo, in 1960. Among the history of Latin American dictatorships, that was one I had never heard of.</p>
<p>A fictionalised story, bringing the characters to the fore. There&rsquo;s relatively little about what they actually did regarding revolutionary activities, but lots about them as daughters, as mothers. It&rsquo;s told from four points of view: each of the murdered sisters, Patria, Minerva, and Mate; and that of their surviving sister, Dedé.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautifully written novel, heartbreaking because you know how it&rsquo;s going to end, and because the characters are so well-realised, so brought to life.</p>
<p>The day they were murdered, the 25th of November 1960, is memorialised by the UN as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_for_the_Elimination_of_Violence_against_Women">International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women</a>.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s only a few days since I finished — just over a week since the year-long wait was over — and it seems like ages. Now we&rsquo;re back into another wait — hopefully not more than a year — till we find out what&rsquo;s next for Strike and Robin.</p>
<p>Here, Robin has to go undercover to investigate a cult. By which I mean, she has to sign up as if she were a believer, and go deep, deep undercover. It gets very tense.</p>
<p>Minor spoilers follow.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t enjoy this as much as the previous one or two, I think. Certainly at first I was a bit disappointed because of the time-jump. We&rsquo;re eight months after the end of <cite>The Ink Black Heart</cite>, when I had expected it to continue straight on, the way <cite>Troubled Blood</cite> flowed right into <cite>IBH</cite>.</p>
<p>But I think the main problem was that the two main characters are separated for much of it, precisely because she&rsquo;s undercover, so can&rsquo;t really communicate with him.</p>
<p>Of course, once it all kicked into gear, the pages kept turning like they always do. But, while it was great to see them bring down an appalling cult, it just wasn&rsquo;t as emotionally resonant for me as, especially, the previous two.</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;ve heard comments about this over the years, but I can&rsquo;t
remember whether people say it's surprisingly good, or so bad it's
good.</p>
<p>It's somewhere in between, of course. It's very much of its time,
which was 1995 — the same year as <cite>The Matrix</cite>, if I&rsquo;m remembering
correctly. And while it comes from a place not that far from <cite>The
Matrix</cite> — it&rsquo;s about hackers and how our lives are tied up with
computer systems, after all — it&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>Not least because it&rsquo;s far more a realist piece, compared to the
SF/fantasy stylings of the Wachowskis' film. Here, Sandra Bullock is a
freelance computer expert of loosely defined skills, who gets caught in
the backwash from the corruption of a sometime client&rsquo;s security
software.</p>
<p>Something like that, anyway. It starts very slowly, despite a dramatic
prelude incident, but she&rsquo;s soon on the run, wooed and threatened by a
glamorous hacker/gangster.</p>
<p>Out on her own with no one she can trust, she has to trust herself.</p>
<p>It's not bad. Probably not so-bad-it&rsquo;s-good, either. Just OK.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve always considered this the least of Iain Banks&rsquo;s novels. As, I think, did he. If I remember correctly, this was the one about which he said he wrote it without a plan, and he&rsquo;d never do that again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s strange, coming back to <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a>, and reading this for the first time in many years, to find that I liked it far more than I expected to. (Funny to note that my only other reference to it here was <a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/01/25/a-song-of.html">saying it was better than I remembered</a>.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that bad at all. It doesn&rsquo;t meander the way you might expect the &lsquo;no plan&rsquo; thing to imply. What is striking is how apt the title is. A significant proportion of the narrative is taken up with the main character&rsquo;s dreams. All of which either illuminate her past or tie in to other events in the plot, so they make sense.</p>
<p>But whichever novelist it was that I remember saying, &lsquo;Never have a dream sequence&rsquo; — Chris Priest, I think — must hate it.</p>

<p>The 1954 version of <em>A Star is Born</em> has in it the bones of a great film. It is not, however, the great film it&rsquo;s reputed to be.</p>
<p>I should start by noting that our enjoyment of this was marred by the fact that the sound was out of sync. We rented it from Apple TV on our Roku box, and it was out from the start. I tried all the suggestions I could find online to fix it, short of a factory reset. Thing is, all of those were about the sound being out of sync <em>on the Roku</em>.</p>
<p>But the Roku was fine, in every other app, and in other things in the Apple TV app (great to have <em>The Morning Show</em> back). No, the problem here was that particular file, it seemed like.</p>
<p>Maybe there was a way we could have forced a redownload of it, and got a different version. If so, it wasn&rsquo;t to be found.</p>
<p>But you adjust, you put up with things. We were startled half an hour or so in (to a <em>three hour film</em>, I note) when the video stopped and was replaced with a sepia-toned still image. Clearly a production still. The audio, and the story, carried on. The picture changed to another still. Visuals came back, to a long shot. Then another still.</p>
<p>This was strange enough that it deserved duckducking. Turns out we were seeing the result of studio meddling. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/oqnc5i/a_star_is_born_1954_does_an_uncut_print_exist/">It seems a producer, believing it was too long, made the decision to cut it</a>.
Without the director.</p>
<p>And later the studio, in a BBC-<em>Doctor Who</em>-video-wiping level of stupidity, melted the offcuts down to reclaim the silver.</p>
<p>Thing is, the producer may have been wrong at the time &mdash; according to that story, the shortened version was less popular &mdash; and he was certainly wrong in <em>what</em> he cut; but he wasn&rsquo;t wrong about the film being overlong.</p>
<p>That may be unfair. <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/01/01/rrr.html">Three-hour films can work perfectly well</a>, after
all. No, the edits should have been made at the script stage.</p>
<p>Or maybe at directing.Because this film is incoherent at times. A sudden cut and it&rsquo;s months or years later with no sense of what went on in between. That can be fine, it can work well. Except here it felt
like they had a series of scenes that they wanted to show, and they just bashed them together without a thought for how the story would flow.</p>
<p>There are some great moments. Judy Garland has a fantastic voice, of course, and is a perfectly fine actor, and a very good <em>physical</em> actor, it turns out.</p>
<p>A great voice, rubbish songs, unfortunately. Getting her to sing a song that includes the word &lsquo;somewhere&rsquo; does not make it as good as the song she&rsquo;s most famous for.</p>
<p>Honestly, that and the song-within-a-film-within-the-film (&lsquo;Born in a Trunk&rsquo;, I think it was called) are as much as I remember about the music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of keen to see if the seventies or twenty-tens versions are better. I&rsquo;ve got to imagine they must be.</p>
<p>Shorter, anyway</p>

			 <p>Wordy, as I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/08/18/the-runes-of.html">mentioned before</a>. Long. Unnecessarily repetitive.</p>
<p>But I enjoyed it nonetheless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite glad, though, I don&rsquo;t have the other books yet. I feel it&rsquo;s best to take a break after a story like this. Let it sink in. Prepare yourself, maybe, for the next one.</p>
<p>Anyway, more of the same: The Land is in danger, Linden Avery&rsquo;s son is in Lord Foul&rsquo;s clutches, and she&rsquo;s prepared to do just about anything to save it, and him. But especially him. I expect we&rsquo;re going to see a situation where she puts the whole Land — the whole of Earth, indeed — in danger, by trying to save Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Maybe she already has.</p>
<p>Oh: people have <em>far too many different names</em> in this. I mean, names by which various people refer to them. In the very last chapter someone refers to &lsquo;The Timewarden&rsquo;. I was like, &lsquo;That sounds like The Doctor; what the hell is going on?&rsquo; But they just meant Thomas Covenant.</p>

			 <p>Normally speaking I&rsquo;d claim <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141920078">a novel written in the 1930s and set in the late 40s</a> for science fiction. But this doesn&rsquo;t quite reach the threshold. There are around three obvious things that are futuristic: a reference to the Anglo-Nicaraguan war of 1946; &lsquo;air mail&rsquo;,  where a package sent from London is dropped into a field in Sussex; and the astonishing combination of phone and television, allowing the callers to see as well as hear each other! Or rather, one caller to see the other, since phone boxes don&rsquo;t have &lsquo;television dials&rsquo; (but must at least have cameras).</p>
<p>Oh, and the train service has become rubbish, not because of the car or Beeching, but because (wealthy) people mostly fly.</p>
<p>But all that is nothing compared to how funny and overall good this novel is. Stella Gibbons wrote many other novels, but all of them are out of print but this, which is a great shame.</p>

			 <p>I started reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473619777">this</a> a few years back, and stopped after the first chapter or so, because it seemed too similar to the thing I was trying to write at the time. I didn&rsquo;t want to be overly influenced, or worse, unconsciously plagiarise it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s always been in the back of my mind. And recently I&rsquo;ve been trying to get back into that novel I was working on then, and finding it difficult. So I thought maybe reading the space opera I backed away from because it was too similar to my own nascent space opera would be just what I needed to get me kickstarted.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t quite happened yet (maybe because I read it on holiday), but I loved the hell out of this.</p>
<p>Great characters you enjoy spending time with. A plot that&rsquo;s just believable enough, with stakes that are high for the characters and then get higher. An interesting, believable galactic political background, with Earth as very much the minor player.</p>
<p>None of the nonhuman characters feel really <em>alien</em>, except from in their physical descriptions, but that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to read <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781408871775">this</a> since I read a review of it back when it came out, in 2017. So, six years on, I finally did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly slight, given all the fuss and praise. I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with Saunders before reading that review, but he is famous for his short stories. I&rsquo;ve read a few of those since — at least one during <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">my MA</a> — and they&rsquo;re  fine, but to my mind tend to suffer from the problem that many short stories have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/short-stories/">mentioned this here before</a>, though seemingly only once. Often, when I read a short story — even, or perhaps especially, by one of the supposed greats of of the form: Carver, Hemingway, even Chekhov — I&rsquo;m left thinking, &lsquo;So what? What was the point of writing that, and why did you leave it where you did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, I recognise the skill that it takes to conjure a life, a character, in few words. And Saunders makes good use of that ability here. Because the story is not very much about Abraham Lincoln. It&rsquo;s not even that much about his son, Willie, who is the one who is actually in the &lsquo;bardo&rsquo;, a place where souls wait after death in some schools of Buddhism. Rather, it&rsquo;s about some of the other souls that are trapped in the same Washington graveyard. We get a whole host of compressed backstories.</p>
<p>And we get altogether too many quotes from books and articles about Lincoln and the death of his son. I haven&rsquo;t investigated to see whether these are from actual Lincoln biographies, histories of the American Civil War, and so on, or they are cleverly invented by Saunders. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_in_the_Bardo">This Wikipedia article suggests it&rsquo;s a mixture</a>.) But I found them much less interesting than the stories of the dead souls. A few would have been fine, for background, but it feels like they make up about half the book.</p>
<p>More stories about the dead, please.</p>

			 <p>Forty years ago it was: towards the end of school, Watty — <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/02/12/pennyfarthings-and-paranoia.html">he of the Number 6 badge, celebrating <cite>The Prisoner</cite></a> — turned me on to <cite>The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever</cite>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does he not believe in?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everything!&rsquo; said Watty with relish.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get into the first book. There was an early section where I ground to a halt. But I went back to it, and ripped through the five books of the two trilogies that were out yet.</p>
<p>Then I had to wait. This is largely why I try not to start a series before its author has finished writing it. Those weeks and months through the first year of uni were interminable. (Only in that one regard, though, to be fair.)</p>
<p>There was a guy on my corridor in the halls of residence who was similarly waiting, and when <cite>White Gold Wielder</cite> came out, he bought it at once.</p>
<p>In hardback. I was shocked by the profligacy, and didn&rsquo;t emulate him. Besides, it wouldn&rsquo;t have matched my paperbacks.</p>
<p>But after he&rsquo;d read it, he lent it to me. I wish I could remember his name.</p>
<p>So it should be clear that I liked the books a lot. However, I was thereafter corrupted by the general consensus that these were not well-written books, not a good example of the genre.</p>
<p>And yes, sure, they&rsquo;re not particularly well-written. Donaldson can be over-wordy and repetitive at times. But he knew how to weave a tale that gripped me.</p>
<p>And now, forty years hence, after my son had borrowed my old copies and read them (including my paperback of <cite>White Gold Wielder</cite>, which I bought to complete  the set, but have never read, since I never reread the series) he discovered (something which I vaguely knew) that Donaldson had written a &lsquo;final&rsquo; trilogy. Which has since turned into a tetralogy. I don&rsquo;t know when that happened. This volume that I read — my son&rsquo;s — says it&rsquo;s three volumes.</p>
<p>So how is it? Pretty damn good, actually. A copious &lsquo;What Has Gone Before&rsquo; leads off, and reminds me how much I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> remember about the original six books. And then — well, I don&rsquo;t want to get into spoilers, but after the first hundred or so pages, it&rsquo;s a real page-turner for the next four hundred or so, and leaves me keen to know how it all ends.</p>
<p>So expect more of this stuff here, in due course. This time, it&rsquo;s all finished, and there will be no need for me to wait for a final volume.</p>

			 <p>It’s like China wanted to write a police procedural, a detective story. But being China, there was no way it could be set in the quotidian world of today.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780330534192">Which is great.</a>. The setup here is that there are two cities, Besźel an Ul Qoma, somewhere in Eastern Europe; but they both occupy the same space. People in on can’t interact with those in the other.</p>
<p>That’s about as much as I knew about it before I started.</p>
<p>In another way it feels it&rsquo;s kind of an extended metaphor for how we don&rsquo;t notice things that are right under our noses. Or, as my beloved said, just for how we can live in a city like London alongside people from other cultures, people who look and dress differently, who even move differently; and never interact with them</p>
<p>This is both good and bad, of course. Or can be both or either depending on the circumstances. Because we&rsquo;re ignoring other people, whole swathes of them. The live their lives, full, rich, desperate, happy, sad; and we know nothing of them. They know nothing of us. Yet we don&rsquo;t get in their way. We don&rsquo;t interfere with them. We let them get on with their lives, and they us with ours, not causing them problems, as they cause us none.</p>
<p>Or only the most minor of inconveniences as we avoid each other on the street.</p>
<p>But is there even a <em>third</em> city, co-terminal with the two we know about? Some believe there is. Does Orciny exist?</p>
<p>You’ll have to read it to find out.</p>

			 <p>To tide me over until the new Strike book comes out (in just under two months) I suddenly decided to reread JK&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781408704202">single non-pseudonymous, non-magical book</a>.  It&rsquo;s over a decade old now, which is kind of hard to believe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still bloody heartbreaking. How she can make us feel so much for so many flawed characters (but especially one or two) in so few words, never stops amazing me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slice of small-town England, in which a parish council member dies, leaving the titular vacancy. And all that proceeds from that. It shouldn&rsquo;t be as compelling as it is, based on that description. But there you go.</p>

A rainy Monday in July, and it was packed. The Barbenheimer effect, of course. But I was there on the first weekend of Black Panther, I was at the opening night of the last Star Wars movie… Neither was as busy as this.</p><p>Oppenheimer was incredible. Hard to make out the dialogue, at times, of course, You expect that from Nolan, and we've maybe got worse at listening to screened entertainment, due to nearly always having the subtitles on at home.</p><p>But I didn't feel I missed anything too significant.Oppenheimer's story is quite incredible. I had the vague impression, since I knew only that he'd been instrumental in the Manhattan project, that he was more experimenter than theoretician, maybe an engineer, rather than a physicist. But it turns out (assuming the film and the book it's based on are right) that he was very much a theoretical physicist — even theorising about black holes — and very much not an experimentalist.</p><p>Later 'more politician now than scientist', as one of the many other characters says. And those other characters: so many names from the history of physics, many with parts so small you don't even realise they were there till you look at the cast list. Feynman, for example.</p><p>Heisenberg (I didn't know his politics were so uncertain); Bohr. Einstein, obviously, though he wasn't involved in the Manhattan Project.</p><p>Artistic license: how far were they from the trinity bomb, the initial test detonation? The longest distance they mentioned was twenty miles, for the longest-distance observers, and the closest 1000 yards. That must have been the blast radius, though: there's no way anyone was that close!</p><p>But as represented, the time between the light and the sound seemed ridiculously long. It created quite a chilling effect, though: I may never have experienced such a silence in a cinema.</p><p>Good film, would watch again. Preferably with subtititles.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/05/29/films-books-blogging.html">mentioned in May</a>, that I had been reading this. It&rsquo;s taken me till now to finish it.</p>
<p>In another sense it&rsquo;s taken me a lot longer: I first started reading it in 2004. Back then I was <a href="https://devilgate.org/2005/10/20/postexam-comedown.html">doing an Open University literature course</a>. In one module an extract from <cite><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780140434279">Daniel Deronda</a></cite> was one of the options for us to write about. I think I must have chosen it, because my tutor sung its praises, saying it was a great one to read over Christmas, &lsquo;curled up next to the fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So I bought it and started it at the time. I can be fairly sure of this, as the bookmarks I found in it, when I picked it up back in May, were a pair of old-school paper train tickets from 2004. Two markers, of course, because this is a classics edition with comprehensive endnotes.</p>
<p>The main bookmark was around page 200, so I got a decent way into it. Except this is a book of over 800 pages, so actually not that far. I don&rsquo;t know why I stopped. Probably just got distracted by other books and petered out. I started from the beginning again this time, and found I remembered almost nothing of what I read nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<p>But enough meta story about my history with the book. What of the book itself?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really two main interwoven stories. The title character appears briefly, wordlessly, in the first scene, and then is not seen again for the whole of the first book (it was originally published serially, and is internally divided into eight books). First we get the start of the story of Gwendolen Harleth, a young woman of fair but limited means, who might expect to marry well. Until her family falls into poverty.</p>
<p>Her story at times feels like it&rsquo;s going to be a conventional, Austenesque romance. It is not, of course: it&rsquo;s much more complex than that.</p>
<p>The other story is about how Daniel Deronda rescues a young Jewish woman from self-inflicted drowning, and finds her a home, and what follows from that. This section is largely about the way Jews were treated at the time (the 1870s), and the idea that they might seek a homeland. The start of Zionism, in effect. Deronda is sympathetic to the plight of the Jews generally, as he is to Mirah, the woman he rescued. But then, he&rsquo;s synmpathetic to just about everyone.</p>
<p>The darkest part of this story shows us how terrifyingly restricted, locked down, controlled, a married woman could be in those times. Even if the husband in question is not physically violent, he simply controls all aspects of their lives, and hence her life. She has no hope of escape. It&rsquo;s powerfully understated, and all the more chilling for that.</p>
<p>Some sentences are overly long by modern standards, and some of the language is complex or old-fashioned enough to be confusing, but it usually becomes clear with careful reading. And it doesn&rsquo;t detract from the power of the storytelling.</p>

<p>I first heard of Mike Myers in 1985 or so, at the Edinburgh Fringe.
Someone was giving out flyers for a comedy show (I know, at the Fringe,
right?) If I remember correctly it was the opening night that evening,
at St John&rsquo;s on Prince&rsquo;s Street.</p>
<p>A comedy duo called Mullarkey and Myers. We had probably heard of Neil
Mullarkey, and there was an added incentive: a free bottle of Moosehead
beer (owing to the Canadian nature of one of the performers) if you
turned up with the flyer.</p>
<p>I don't remember anything about the show, but the name and its
existence stuck. Years later came <em>Shrek</em>, in which the same Mike Myers
did a Scottish accent for no very obvious reason. I assumed he had
learned it that year in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way he made this, too. It's fine, but I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/02/05/our-man-flint.html">already
watched <cite>Our Man Flint</cite> this year</a>, so&hellip;</p>
<p>In fact, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the ringtone from Powers&rsquo;s communication
device is lifted from the presidential phone in <cite>Flint</cite>.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m realising I need to get back into the habit of putting things on the blog. More than film notes from Letterboxd and book notes. There won&rsquo;t be another book note for a while because I&rsquo;m reading <cite>Daniel Deronda</cite> by George Eliot. It&rsquo;s 800 pages and I&rsquo;m around the 200 mark.</p>
<p>I started reading something else after Eastercon — did I mention I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastercon">Eastercon</a> this year? Oh, yes, <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/04/07/on-my-way.html">I did</a>, but only briefly. it was in Birmingham, but not in the heart of the city with its many curry restaurants. It was at the Hilton Metropole, out near the airport and NEC.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the guests of honour was Adrian Tchaikovsky, who I&rsquo;ve been aware of but never read for lo! this several years. He seemed personable and interesting, and my friend Simon recommended his <cite>Children of Time</cite>. Turned out I already had that on my Kindle from some offer, so I started it.</p>
<p>And I stopped after about a third. I just wasn&rsquo;t really enjoying it. The spider characters were kind of interesting, and the human ones much less so, and I just didn&rsquo;t care that much about the plot.</p>
<p>Then I discovered that it&rsquo;s the start of a series (or at least that it has sequels, which is not necessarily the same thing). That just put me off more, because if I&rsquo;m not that interested in 400 pages or whatever, how much <em>less</em> interested am I going to be in three times that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in the business of reading things because I &ldquo;should&rdquo;, either because they&rsquo;re in some way classic, or just because I&rsquo;ve started them. Sorry Adrian, sorry Simon.</p>

			 <p>I bought <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781911310990">this</a> on my <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/04/09/conventions-conventionally-drink.html">recent visit to Eastercon</a>, from one of the authors, David Wake.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about the possibility of self-publishing before this, but Wake was on a panel about what to watch out for when you first get a publishing contract (his point: nothing, if you self-publish). He made some good points about the advantages of doing it yourself versus the traditional publishing route. For example, you don&rsquo;t send your sample chapters and synopsis in then wait two years for someone to decide. And even if they say yes, it could be another two years before your book is published.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which way I&rsquo;ll go with my <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/04/06/just-after-midnight.html">recently-finished draft</a>, but I thought it was worth spending a fiver on this to check out the possibilities. And it seems a decent guide to how you can approach publishing both ebooks and paperbacks, for minimal outlay.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go into things like cover design and marketing, which, of course, are some of the things that traditional publishers handle.</p>
<p>I might give it a spin, though, with a novella that I&rsquo;ve got sitting around. We shall see.</p>
<p>Anyway, take a look at this if you&rsquo;re interested in the possibilities. <a href="https://punkpublishers.com/">Their website is here</a>.</p>

So there were a number of scenes where I was relying purely on the visuals and a very hazy understanding of a very few French words.</p><p>But I think I got the gist of most of those parts, and I'd have wanted to watch it again anyway.</p><p>It is, of course, totally brilliant.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781645060659">The sequel</a>  to <cite>Beyond the Hallowed Sky</cite>, which I read <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/01/05/beyond-the-hallowed.html">at the start of last year</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an excellent followup, with a very good summary of the previous novel at the start, which is useful. Top quality SF with politics. Scotland, and the Union (the EU++), are expanding into interstellar space, joining the other two power blocs.</p>
<p>Like the last, and perhaps even more so, this ends in a place that is quite satisfying. No cliffhangers, and if there were no more books, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Though at the same time it&rsquo;ll be great to see what happens in book 3.</p>

			 <p>Atkinson&rsquo;s <cite>Life After Life</cite> was the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2014/03/26/the-first-three.html">wonderful</a> story of Ursula Todd, who kept repeating her life, dying in different ways each time. One interpretation or explanation for this strange experience is that she was trying to create (or find, or reach) a version of her life in which her beloved brother Teddy survives the Second World War and lives to grow old.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780385618700"><cite>A God in Ruins</cite></a> is the story of that timeline.</p>
<p>Or maybe a couple of timelines. While this is in most ways a more straightforward tale than its predecessor, we do see two or three possible different endings for Teddy. It&rsquo;s also about his descendants: his daughter the infuriating Viola, and her two children. It&rsquo;s kind of a redemption tale for some characters.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the bits about Teddy&rsquo;s wartime expreiences as a bomber pilot most. Overall it&rsquo;s not as good as <cite>Life After Life</cite>, but not bad.</p>

As a film it's pretty decent. As a biopic, it left me wanting more. I'd have liked to see about a bit more of her career than just the big breakthrough case that first brought her to public attention.
<p>That case, though, is interesting. It was a sex-discrimination one<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> where the discriminated-against party was a man. He was a carer for his elderly mother, and the fact that he had never been married meant he wasn&rsquo;t entitled to a tax credit, where a woman would have been.</p>
<p>Ginsburg was able to convince the judges to declare the law unconstitutional, as it discriminated arbitrarily, on the titular basis. And with the ACLU, she was then able to tackle the many laws that discriminated similarly against women. Clever.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Or gender-discrimination, as they renamed it, because &lsquo;sex is all over the brief&rsquo;, and it would distract the judges — male, of course; at least, according to the film. And I wonder if we can draw a line of causality from that decision to the position of gender in the culture today.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p><cite><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781446420874">The Rings of Saturn</a></cite> is a very unusual book. My copy has this classification on the back: &lsquo;Fiction/Memoir/Travel&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Well make up your mind, I might say!</p>
<p>And yet, it is all those things, and the combination makes a compelling, readable whole. Sebald (or the narrator) goes on walks around Norfolk and Suffolk. Along the way his thoughts carry him on paths that both parallel his physical ones and diverge far from them in both time and space. He muses on history, architecture, biography, geology, ecology, and much more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/22/where-to-start-with-wg-sebald">This <cite>Guardian</cite> &lsquo;Where to Start With…&rsquo; article</a> saves it for last, as &lsquo;the one you&rsquo;ll want your friends to read&rsquo;. Which is fair enough.</p>

			 <p>To Cambridge, on Thursday just past, and to the Corn Exchange, to see Suzanne Vega. My one-word review: spellbinding.</p>
<p>I had never been to the Corn Exchange before (to be honest I&rsquo;ve rarely been to a gig — especially an indoor gig — outside London these last thirty-six or so years). But it&rsquo;s one of those places that feels slightly legendary to me, because I&rsquo;d see it listed among the tour dates in <cite>Sounds</cite> or <cite>NME</cite> back in my youthhood.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s a lovely, clean, modern venue, with Old Speckled Hen on tap. We were seated in the balcony (on the balcony?), which was fine.</p>
<p>And as to Ms Vega: I&rsquo;m not steeped in her work, so the fact that she essentially played a &lsquo;Greatest Hits&rsquo; set was ideal for me. She even explicitly said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna play some of the well-known ones early, so people don&rsquo;t worry that they won&rsquo;t get them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This after she&rsquo;d opened with &lsquo;Marlene on the Wall&rsquo;, followed by &lsquo;Small Blue Thing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She had one accompanying musician, a guitarist called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Leonard">Gerry Leonard</a>, who has worked with Bowie, among others. He was great, making heavy use of those sampling/looping pedals, making him sometimes sound like three or four players at once.</p>
<p>So, like I say, the whole thing was spellbinding.

			 <p>Watty was  wearing a badge, one of the big, old kind. Probably two inches across, round. They used to advertise them in the back of <cite>Sounds</cite>, <cite>NME</cite>, <cite>Record Mirror</cite> (and I think there was a fourth member of the British weekly music press, but I can&rsquo;t recall it). They always included the size, in old-fashioned imperial units: one-inch, two-inch. Probably inch-and-a-half.</p>
<p>In the early days we wore the big ones. My first one was almost certainly a Beatles one, but I don&rsquo;t remember what design it had. I do recall a glittery Thin Lizzy one, when I went through my period of them being one of my faves. Wings, maybe? Probably.</p>
<p>Anyway, with punk, the badge size that was considered cool, or even acceptable, reduced. Anything bigger than an inch across would lead to mockery, for sure. Although I think Brendan&rsquo;s Stranglers badge, saying &lsquo;Something Better Change&rsquo; (&lsquo;Because I like the song and I like what it says&rsquo;) was of the two-inch persuasion, but that was in the early days.</p>
<p>Watty&rsquo;s one, the one that I&rsquo;m talking about: that was probably even earlier. It was white, with the outline of what I had to get quite close to realise was a penny farthing bicycle. And a number: 6.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that about, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/158671"><cite>The Prisoner</cite></a>! Do you not know about it?&rsquo; Watty wasn&rsquo;t too bad in this way, but the default reaction to someone being ignorant of something you liked was mockery, back then, when we were 13, 14. To be honest, probably for a decade or more after that, too. Instead of the healthier attempt to infect the ignorant one with our own enthusiasm. Or at least inform them about it.</p>
<p>I learned, though, that it was a weird programme that was on late at night, and anyway it was over now, so even if it hadn&rsquo;t been on at a time that I wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to stay up on a school night, it was finished, so there was no chance I&rsquo;d ever get to see it.</p>
<p>Pity.</p>
<p>Of course, <cite>The Prisoner</cite> was originally broadcast in 1967-8, so if Watty was watching it ten years later, it does show that repeats were a thing. If only there were a way we could have our own copies of TV programmes. But what a fantastic, farcical idea!</p>
<p>I know it was the early days, because the name &lsquo;The Prisoner&rsquo; did not immediately make me think of The Clash. The <a href="https://song.link/i/688798635">B-side</a> of &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/i/647246391">(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais</a>&rsquo; shares a title with Patrick McGoohan&rsquo;s paranoid cold-war ex-spy drama. I don&rsquo;t think it has anything else in common with it, but you can&rsquo;t be sure.</p>
<p>I finally saw some episodes in the early nineties. I bought some on VHS, along with my friend Johnny, who also hadn&rsquo;t seen it. But that didn&rsquo;t prove very practical, as we live in different cities. And VHS was expensive. Two episodes per tape for, what fifteen quid? So that petered out.</p>
<p>Much later I got the DVD box set. And it&rsquo;s been one of the things we&rsquo;ve been watching over the last few months. Er, years, maybe. It might have started in lockdown.</p>
<p>Tonight we finally watched the last two episodes. Which were much better than I had been led to believe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of amazing, saturated as it is with sixties fears about mind control, brainwashing, hypnotism. Is anything real after the unnamed main character gets gassed in the opening of the first episode (repeated in the opening credits of almost every episode)? Maybe the whole thing is a hallucination induced by the gas, you know?</p>
<p>There are certainly plenty of actual induced hallucinations or dreamlike states in the series. Which is why you can&rsquo;t trust the increasingly psychedelic ending.</p>
<p>The whole thing is a mindfuck. I loved it.</p>

<p>I remember seeing this as a kid and absolutely loving it. We talked about it at school, probably played at being Flint.</p>
<p>It’s a Bond spoof. James Coburn as Flint is a super agent who is brought out of retirement to save the world from some mad scientists who are controlling the weather.</p>
<p>I only remembered two things about it. His ability to stop his heart for maximum rest, and the device in his watch that got him started again; and his lighter, with ‘82 functions… 83 if you want to light a cigar.’</p>
<p>It’s daft nonsense, but fun in places. There’s even a lesser agent called 0008 (Triple Oh Eight) who tells him ‘It’s bigger than SPECTRE.)</p>

<p><cite>Tár</cite> is a much-discussed, disputed, disagreed-upon <em>tour de force</em>. Not since <cite><a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/02/27/oscar-action.html">Moonlight</a></cite> have I read so much about a film after seeing it.</p>
<p>Lydia Tár is a conductor who is rehearsing with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra for what should be the pinnacle of her career, a live recording of Mahler's Symphony No 5. But she has a past, and it's coming to get her.</p>
<p>Perhaps my favourite interpretation is the too-long-titled '<a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/12/tar-cate-blanchett-movie-ending-explained-analyzed.html"><cite>Tár</cite> Is the Most-Talked-About Movie of the Year. So Why Is Everyone Talking About It All Wrong?</a>', from <cite>Slate</cite>. It posits that the last third or so is, essentially, fantasy, hallucination, or similar.</p>
<p>There's a lot to get out of this — not least encouraging me to listen to Mahler's Fifth — and I'm looking forward to watching it again.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>First, cards on the table, Bob is a friend of mine. <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780957217409">Bomber Jackson Does Some</a> is his first novel, self-published in 2012. He gave us a copy back then, and it&rsquo;s taken me till now to read it.</p>
<p>Just because of the size of my to-read piles, not any quality concerns.</p>
<p>Bomber is an ex-boxer and an alcoholic. At the start of the novel he has just got out of prison. As you might imagine from such a setup, things largely go downhill from there. His thoughts include a fair amount of slang, some of which I didn&rsquo;t understand, but the meaning was usually clear from context. For example, he refers to two homeless men as &lsquo;real old-fashioned paraffins&rsquo;. Paraffin lamp = tramp, I assume.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written in first person, present tense, which I think is quite a hard voice to sustain. Bob does a good job of getting us inside Bomber&rsquo;s head, and the story flows along at fine old rate.</p>
<p>All in all, top stuff. Recommended if you can get hold of a copy.</p>

The same year as Woodstock, but much less well-known. The footage was shot at the time, but lay in a basement for fifty years, because the then-filmmakers couldn't get it broadcast.</p><p>We get Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Sly & the Family Stone, Mahalia Jackson, Stevie Wonder…</p><p>If I have a complaint it's that I'd like there to be more of the music and less of the interviews. Or not less of them: the interviews are good. I especially liked the ones that started with some of the surviving performers watching their younger selves. But for most of the acts we just get one song, and an interview gets superimposed over part of it.</p><p>Well worth a watch, though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m shocked that I posted less than 100 times, but there you go. I&rsquo;ve been busy with other things.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other Things</h2>
<h3 id="writing-a-novel">Writing a Novel</h3>
<p>What time I had for writing outside of work, I tried to spend mainly on completing my novel. You&rsquo;ll recall that I did a <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">Creative Writing MA</a> in 2020–21. I graduated in May 2022. My <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/09/17/dissertation-submitted.html">dissertation</a> was essentially the first 15,000 words of a novel (along with a preface on how it had all come together). I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/12/17/at-the-start.html">promised myself</a> that I&rsquo;d finish it by the end of the year. I haven&rsquo;t quite achieved that goal, but I expect to in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<h3 id="new-job">New Job</h3>
<p>But to that &lsquo;outside of work&rsquo;, above: I started a new job in February. I never quite got round to writing about it here, except on my <a href="https://devilgate.org/now/"><code>/now</code> page</a>, which is an infrequently-maintained page that&rsquo;s meant to say what I&rsquo;m up to at any time. I was and am glad to have it, of course, but it&rsquo;s amazing how much working 9–5:30 again takes away from your ability to do other things.</p>
<p>The job itself? I was employed as a Java Developer — that&rsquo;s literally in my job title — and I have written precisely zero lines of Java.</p>
<p>Instead, I found myself plunged into the exciting new world of infrastructure as code, or IaC, and the <a href="https://www.terraform.io">Terraform</a> language. I might write more about that at some point, but in short, it seems I work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> now, and I&rsquo;m enjoying it.</p>
<h4 id="digression-on-writing-at-work">Digression: On Writing at Work</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written over 70,000 words of a novel over the past year-and-a-half or so. But since February I&rsquo;ve written something like 100,000 words at work. This comes from keeping copious notes on what I&rsquo;ve being doing and what I&rsquo;ve learned, and so on. I thank <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> for making it easy to do so, and for working in a way that matches how I want to work. But I wonder: why didn&rsquo;t I keep notes like this before? I always wrote things down, of course, but not this systematically, this comprehensively.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mystery.</p>
<h3 id="jury-duty">Jury Duty</h3>
<p>In May I spent three weeks on a Jury at <a href="https://hornseyhistorical.org.uk/wood-green-crown-court-what-was-there-before/">Wood Green Crown Court</a>. That was an interesting experience. I might write more about it one day.</p>
<h3 id="etc">Etc</h3>
<p>And all the other things that make up life. Hey, I even read <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/books-2022/">33 books last year</a>!</p>

			 <p>Not just <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/12/30/knives-out.html">another</a> murder mystery, but an undeniably cosy one. OK, the deaths aren&rsquo;t cosy, obviously, but the mood and vibe of <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780241988275">the book</a> certainly is.</p>
<p>The club in question is made up of four residents at a retirement village. They start out by speculatively investigating cold cases that a former member, who had been a police officer, had records of. But soon a hot case lands right in front of them, and things get interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious in places, moving, well-plotted, and, let&rsquo;s face it, a tad unconvincing. But you don&rsquo;t let that bother you while you&rsquo;re reading it.</p>
<p>Which you should do.</p>

			 <p>As any fan will realise instantly, the title of this comes from Lou Reed&rsquo;s &lsquo;Romeo Had Juliet&rsquo;. So that&rsquo;s going to draw my interest right away. Then from the blurb we learn that Lou himself is a character in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781617756429">the story</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s a kind of coming-of-age novel about a seventeen-year-old boy from Queens in 1976 or so, who moves with his mother to Manhattan, and into the block where Lou Reed is also living. The boy, Matt, becomes something of a friend/assistant to Lou for a while.</p>
<p>In a parallel narrative, Matt falls for a girl at his new school, who might be involved in some withcrafty kind of stuff. It&rsquo;s not obvious exactly how the timelines of the two strands relate, but things come to a head — or a couple of heads, you could say.</p>
<p>The book closes with a chapter entitled &lsquo;Afterwords&rsquo; (note the plural) in which the narrator — or the author — writes after Lou&rsquo;s death. This section makes it seem as if the early section was based on real events. The author is a successful actor, so who knows?</p>
<p>I want to quote this from that last section, about Lou&rsquo;s music, because I love it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And more than anything else, it was punk. Which should come as no surprise since you were its creator. I don&rsquo;t care what Detroit says, you were doing it when Iggy was a mere Osterberg and Kramer was trying to figure out who the other four would be. As for the lads from my neck of the woods (famous for their <em>&ldquo;One, two, three, four&rdquo;</em> count-off and three power chords) who are considered by some as the progenitors of the movement… well, that just makes no sense chronologically or otherwise. Not to mention (but I will) that they basically wrote the same song over and over again. And however great a song it may be, it renders deep catalog cuts redundant. Sorry, kids, I guess you had to be there—on the Bowery when it happened. But I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the same goes for the little London boy. Just the first few sentences you speak to the audience on <cite>Take No Prisoners</cite> relegates John-John to a corner with some crayons and a finger up his nose. The revolution you started was one of art and intellect. It inspired the defeat of tyranny in Czechoslovakia, for Christ&rsquo;s sake. God save the queen, indeed.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;The little London boy.&rsquo; 😀</p>
<p>Something about the length, the writing style, and the age of the narrator, suggests that this book should or would be considered young-adult (YA). But the Lou Reed connection makes it much more likely that people in my age group will be drawn to it. I don&rsquo;t know what that means.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it, anyway. And it was a Christmas present from my daughter.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m quite pleased to have read as many as 31 books this year. Not sure quite how I&rsquo;ve managed it, what with writing my own, and starting a new job, and all. Partly a lot of rereading of page-turners, of course.</p>
<p>Le Guin&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780426064374">Rocannon&rsquo;s World</a> was not a reread for me, though I&rsquo;ve had it on my shelf for years. Bought second-hand, I&rsquo;m sure, I don&rsquo;t recall where or when, but it&rsquo;s an edition from 1978. And it&rsquo;s a super-slim volume. It probably wouldn&rsquo;t be classified as a novel at all, in today&rsquo;s publishing world. It&rsquo;s kind of a slight story, about a person from an advanced species — an Earth-human, essentially — getting stranded on a planet at bronze-age levels of technology, with various species of native humanoid.</p>
<p>The titular Rocannon has to make his way across the world to find the other high-level aliens who have caused him to be stranded, avenge himself, warn his people about their aggression, and maybe try to get rescued.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s maybe most notable for being, I believe, the place where Le Guin first used the term <em>Ansible</em> for s faster-than-light communication device. She went on to use it in many other novels, and other SF authors adopted it.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s also the name for something in IT automation. Infrastructure as code. Of which concept, though not Ansible, more later, probably.</p>

			 <p>I missed posting this yesterday, what with one thing and another. Twenty years ago yesterday, the 22<sup>nd</sup> of December 2002, my friend Tony texted me and the other members of our then-band, Burn, to the effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nooooooooo!</p>
<p>Strummer&rsquo;s dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was at work, and immediately googled for the story.  Joe Strummer, dead at 50 from an undiagnosed heart defect. We didn&rsquo;t hear the reason at once, of course.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://devilgate.org/2002/12/23/the-death-of.html">The Death of a Hero</a> at the time. Not much has changed, in some ways. I still play his music, both The Clash and his solo stuff. I sometimes wonder what he&rsquo;d have to say about the times we live in now.</p>
<p>Hard to imagine he&rsquo;d have been 70 this year. Such is life, and death.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s amusing, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526643155">this one</a> coming straight after <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/11/22/the-books-of.html">this year&rsquo;s behemoth</a>, since the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/11/22/jerusalem-by-alan.html">last book I read by Moore</a> was a similar year-spanning (and reading-year-consuming) monster.</p>
<p>This one, however, is much more straightforward and shorter read than <cite>Jerusalem</cite>. It&rsquo;s a book of short stories. Or more accurately, a book containing some short stories and one that is more or less long enough to be a novel on its own.</p>
<p>That one — &lsquo;What We Can Know About Thunderman&rsquo; — is a fractured history of the US comics market. It tells of the two big companies — American and Goliath — and a few smaller ones that mostly got gobbled up over the years. American famously has the eponymous Man of Storms as its most famous character, along with King Bee, Moon Queen, and many more.</p>
<p>We get the stories of how various young fans attend conventions and end up as professionals, and what happens to some of them afterwards. But why are some odd things happening to people who work for American?</p>
<p>That one&rsquo;s the centrepiece, but I think my favourite might be &lsquo;American Light — An Appreciation&rsquo;. Subtitled as &lsquo;by C. F. Bird&rsquo;, it presents an annotated version of a poem, the &lsquo;American Light&rsquo; of the title, by a beat poet called Harmon Belner. In 26 pages and 86 footnotes, Moore manages to give us a pretty good beat poem, and tell parts of at least two life stories. You&rsquo;ve got to read all the footnotes, though.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The other stories are good, too. &lsquo;The Improbably Complex High-Energy State&rsquo; takes place in the first femtoseconds of the universe.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> &lsquo;Location, Location, Location&rsquo; is the story of an estate agent and her client after the world has ended.</p>

<p>I was mildly distracted by this text early in that <cite>Guardian</cite> report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pioneering 2 Tone band rose thanks to the support of Joe Strummer,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> who invited them to support the Clash live,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While not wrong, it ignores the fact that The Specials were bloody brilliant! The piece does make that clear later, to be fair, but it seems slightly the wrong way to weight it.</p>
<p>I also listened to some Fun Boy Three, and they were far better than I remembered, too, both with and without Bananarama.</p>

<p>When I was a little kid my family used to go on holiday to
<a href="https://millport.org">Millport</a>, on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Cumbrae">Isle of
Cumbrae</a>,
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Clyde">Firth of
Clyde</a>.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t go to the cinema often, if ever, back then. But Millport had
a small cinema, and we always went once or twice when on holiday.</p>
<p>I don't recall any of the films we saw in the four years we holidayed
there. What I <em>do</em> remember is the film posters, because they were
always there, so I saw them year after year. And unusually, they were
round the walls inside the auditorium. So while you waited for the
lights to go down, you saw adverts for films that once shown there.</p>
<p>It's where I first heard of the <cite>Dollars</cite> trilogy. Only the first two
then, in a double poster for <cite>A Fistful of Dollars</cite> and <cite>For a Few
Dollars More</cite>. <cite>When Eight Bells Toll</cite>. I think <cite>Ice Station Zebra</cite>.</p>
<p>And one called <cite>Matt Helm Gets it in Denmark</cite>. I eventually saw all the
others, but not that one. As I got a bit older, if ever the name came
back to me, I wondered what kind of &lsquo;getting it&rsquo; the title referred
to. I probably kind of looked like an adventure film, so it was probably
more likely to be a threat to his life, than any other interpretation.
But the <em>entendre</em> was clearly <em>double</em>.</p>
<p>I recently found that our Roku has a strangely-named channel called
&lsquo;Movieland Tv&rsquo; [<em>sic</em> as far as the lowercase &lsquo;v&rsquo; goes]. I had
a poke around, and it seems to specialise in old movies from the 60s and
70s that are not what might now be called classics. Though there are a
couple of Bond films: <cite>Thunderball</cite> (the first Bond film I ever saw) and
<cite>Diamonds are Forever</cite>.</p>
<p>But I came across one called <cite>The Silencers</cite>. The blurb described it as
&lsquo;The first Matt Helm movie&rsquo;. Well! Here was the mysterious figure from
my childhood. If not getting it in Denmark, then at least in danger of
being silenced. The blurb also told us he was an agent who&rsquo;d got out of
the game and his superiors wanted him back.</p>
<p>Fair enough, sounds like it could be OK, and I fancied something like a
spy film tonight.</p>
<p>The first surprise was the star: Dean Martin. Now, that poster back in
Millport <em>might</em> have shown his name in large type, and if it did you&rsquo;d
think the collision of his last name with my first would have stuck with
me. But if so, that fact is lost in the mists of memory.</p>
<p>After an opening where four hit men are given bullets with &lsquo;Matt Helm&rsquo;
written on them, it starts with a woman dancing. And, basically,
stripping. It&rsquo;s obviously trying to be like a Bond opening scene, but,
way sub-even-that-standard.</p>
<p>And then another woman starts singing, and the credits include original
songs by Elmer Bernstein, and a choreographer. Is this a musical?</p>
<p>Well, no, but if you&rsquo;ve got Dean Martin in the studio, you&rsquo;d be daft
not to get him to sing a bit. Which he doesn&rsquo;t do in character, but
does in a couple of scenes in voiceover, in effect. Oh and there&rsquo;s a
joke with Sinatra coming on the radio and Helm saying, &lsquo;Turn that off,
I can&rsquo;t stand his voice.&rsquo; They retune, and a Dean Martin song comes
on, and he says. &lsquo;Now this guy can sing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I know, it&rsquo;s not much of a joke.</p>
<p>It's a daft spy romp, and from Helm&rsquo;s amorous adventures, I think
it's now clear which kind of &lsquo;getting it&rsquo; will be happing in Denmark.
Though probably a bit of both.</p>
<p>I'm giving it one star for making me laugh several times, though mainly
at the ridiculousness. And half a star for the fantastic mobile bed. Why
move to answer the phone when you can flick a switch and have your bed
rotate you to where it is? And when you want to have a bath, just let
your bed take you there and drop you in.</p>
<p>Honestly, that bit wouldn&rsquo;t have been out of place on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Island">Tracy
Island</a>.</p>
<p>Other than that, it&rsquo;s complete mince.</p>

			 <p>I am unreasonably happy about having finished this before the end of the year. I started reading it at the start of the year. In fact, possibly before the start of the year, since it was a Christmas present.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ve read <a href="/categories/books-2022/">28 other books</a> while intermittently dipping into this behemoth, something I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/02/13/raw-spirit-in.html">alluded to</a> once <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/03/16/the-schrdingers-cat.html">or twice</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a historical novel set in the middle and end of the 18th century, telling the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Frank">Jacob Frank</a>, a Polish Jew who led a cult, or alternative religious community if you prefer. He converted to Islam, then to Catholicism, taking his followers with him on the second of those changes. But they remained &lsquo;true believers&rsquo;, treating Frank as the true Messiah.</p>
<p>It took me so long to read partly because it&rsquo;s so long, and certainly not because it was uninteresting. In fact it&rsquo;s surprisingly compelling, considering the subject matter. But it is complex. Not least because of all the Polish place names and names of people. The latter is compounded when they get baptised into the Catholic church. They take on new names, so now most characters have two sets of names.</p>
<p>I got a surprise when I first picked up the book to find that it&rsquo;s numbered backwards. Chapter 1 of Book 1 starts on page 892. The story ends on page 27. (There are some notes and blank pages after that.)  At first I thought I might have to read it &lsquo;backwards&rsquo;, but no: the story proceeds in the direction I&rsquo;m used to. It&rsquo;s just the numbering.</p>
<p>I wondered if this was a reference to the direction of Hebrew writing, and Tokarczuk&rsquo;s note at the end confirms that it is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as well as a reminder that every order, every system, is simply a matter of what you&rsquo;ve got used to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is fair enough. I quite liked knowing how many pages I still had to go, with having to subtract. Especially as I got near the end.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, in the last couple of weeks I read this in  &lsquo;<a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/shift-happens/issues/some-good-news-1458208">Shift Happens</a>&rsquo;, a newsletter about a book about keyboards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(in Poland and parts of Europe, books have their tables of contents at the end, and so will mine).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which isn&rsquo;t the case here, but I thought it was an interesting slightly-connected idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge work, in more ways than one, and also an incredible example of the translator&rsquo;s art.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Since Musk&rsquo;s takeover of Twitter has been confirmed, there has been a lot of chatter about free speech. Musk, we are told, describes himself as a &lsquo;free speech maximalist&rsquo;, and there are fears that he&rsquo;ll have Twitter reinstate the accounts of Trump and other white supremacists.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Joe Strummer.</p>
<p>More specifically, I&rsquo;ve been wondering why his &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1443369287">The Road to Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll</a>&rsquo; was popping into my head so often. It wasn&rsquo;t a problem: getting an earworm of a song I like doesn&rsquo;t bother me. But I wondered what was triggering it.</p>
<p>I can often work out why I get a song in my head. I knew, for example, why I often had The Clash&rsquo;s &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/gb/i/688798635">The Prisoner</a> ' in my head through the summer. The words &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner">The Prisoner</a> ' are written on the whiteboard in our kitchen, along with the titles of the other serieses we&rsquo;re watching.</p>
<p>And in fact I sing &lsquo;The Prisoner&rsquo; every time I hang out the washing, owing to its line referring to &lsquo;hanging out the washing and clipping coupons and generally being decent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It clicked today, though. You know how — if you&rsquo;re an old-school album listener (or just old) like me — when you play an album, one track&rsquo;s ending often triggers the expectation of the next? So that, when you hear a song in isolation, on a playlist or on the radio or something, and the wrong song plays next, it can be quite jarring?</p>
<p>The song before &lsquo;The Road to Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll&rsquo; on <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1443368778"><cite>Rock Art and the X-Ray Style</cite></a> is &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1443369281">Techno D-Day</a>&rsquo;. Joe&rsquo;s celebration of illegal raves ends with the line, &lsquo;And this is about free speech!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So it turns out my head was just playing the next song whenever the phrase came up.</p>

			 <p>And so I circle back and reread the book I read <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/09/12/the-ink-black.html">just over a month ago</a>.</p>
<p>This has been a most enjoyable experience, reading through the whole series. Rereading this one so soon was an excellent opportunity to see if I could spot any clues that I missed the first time (certainly one or two).</p>
<p>The apparent logical jumps the characters make at the climax made more sense this time, so that was good.</p>
<p>Excellent stuff. I look forward to the next one.</p>

<p>Martin McDonagh&rsquo;s latest is sad, hilarious, tragic, and true. Or feels like it could be true, even if some of the decisions characters make are baffling, to say nothing of gruesome.</p>
<p>On a rugged, beautiful island off the coast of Ireland in 1923, with the civil war going on on the mainland, two friends fall out. Or rather, one says he doesn&rsquo;t like the other any more. A whole sequence of events flow out from this simple, almost child-like choice.</p>
<p>The funniest part happens when one of them goes to confession.But that&rsquo;s only to be expected: confession&rsquo;s a pretty funny kind of thing, when you think about it.</p>

			 <p>For some reason this is the one whose title never sticks in my mind. When I try to think of the books in the series I always seem to have a hard time bringing this one to mind.</p>
<p>Which is by no means because of the story, which is excellent. Strike and Robin take on a cold case, 40 years old. <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/05/19/troubled-blood-by.html">When I wrote about this before</a> I said I thought there was too much time spent on the other cases. That didn&rsquo;t seem so this time.</p>
<p>Also back then, I was recovering from being sick. This time I was just starting to be. And indeed, I was reading a section where Strike gets flu and tries desperately to convince himself that he <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be getting it; to no avail, of course. I was reading that and thinking, &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m definitely getting it.&rsquo; <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/10/06/well-damn-as.html">And not flu</a>.</p>

<p>Politics is the background for this one, with Robin going undercover at the House of Commons to try to find out who&rsquo;s blackmailing a government minister — or rather, why? The blackmailers are known, but nobody outside of the minister&rsquo;s family knows what it is they have on him.</p>
<p>All good stuff, as ever. I had totally forgotten who was behind it all (where &lsquo;it&rsquo; is the murder that follows the blackmail), which just goes to show you can easily enjoy a whodunit <a href="https://devilgate.org/2018/10/04/lethal-white-by.html">a second time</a>.</p>

			 <p>God, I have missed this <em>so</em> much. Live music FTW.</p>
<p>I get emails from the <a href="https://joestrummerfoundation.org">Joe Strummer Foundation</a> . The most recent one told me that their <a href="https://joestrummerfoundation.org/gemma-rogers-jsfs-featured-artist-for-september/">artist of the month for September</a>  was someone called <a href="https://www.gemmarogersmusic.com">Gemma Rogers</a>. I hadn&rsquo;t heard of her, but was interested when I read that she&rsquo;d had an album launch at <a href="https://paperdressvintage.co.uk">Paper Dress Vintage</a>. That&rsquo;s a place just down the road from me on the Narrow Way. It used to just be a second-hand clothes shop, but now it&rsquo;s more, I guess.</p>
<p>Anyway, the thought that she might be a local piqued my interest, as well as the JSF recommendation, so I gave her a listen, and liked what I heard a lot.</p>
<p>She was booked to play at a place called <a href="https://www.folklorehoxton.com/info">Folklore</a>, on Hackney Road, so I thought, why not? In support was <a href="https://www.gabigarbutt.com">Gabi Garbutt and the Illuminations</a> , who I saw once a few years back, because <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/336678-Sean-Read">Sean Read</a>, whom I know from round these parts, was producing them and playing in the band. Back then. Not anymore. Not tonight, at least.</p>
<p>Going to a gig in a small venue? No big deal, right? Except… this is the first gig I&rsquo;ve been to since I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/03/01/glen-matlock-remembers.html">saw Glen Matlock</a>. At the end of February 2020.</p>
<p>It felt like quite a step.</p>
<p>But after a bite to eat across the road, we made our way in through forbidding, castle-like doors. Inside is a smallish bar area, and a classic pub backroom. The stage made of two layers of forklift pallets topped with hardboard. It was smoky. Visually, it was like being back in the eighties. But of course, it was stage smoke-machine smoke. Exactly why it filled the air before anyone had taken to the stage escapes me.</p>
<p>Unless it was to show the lasers. It looked like this:</p>

<p>Anyway, Veronica  Bianqui brought her Hollywood-fuelled LA tones to Hackney Road. Though it turned out she had been on the bus with us down from Clapton.</p>

  </a>
  <figcaption>Veronica Bianqui on stage</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I probably enjoyed Gabi Garbutt&rsquo;s performance most of the three. Because at times? At times they sounded a bit like late-period Clash.</p>

  <a class="reference" href="/images/2022-09-29/gabi-garbutt.jpeg">

</figure>
<p>They sounded. Like. The Clash. <cite>Combat Rock</cite>-era. I think it was mainly the bass player sounding a bit like Paul Simonon. Whatever, I can pay no higher compliment. No higher compliment <em>can</em> be paid.</p>
<p>But Gemma Rogers was also great, with the singalong of &lsquo;Rabbit Hole&rsquo; being the highlight. Not often you get the band applauding the audience.</p>

<p>But yes: I had missed it so much more than I realised. Just getting together in room with a hundred or so people, while others make rocking sounds up the front? How could I have forgotten?</p>

			 <p>I surprised myself, really. I, an avowed republican and atheist, watched the Queen&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>It was a historic event, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that. If only because we need reminding once in a while that we live in a militarist theocracy.</p>
<p>Sure, the Prime Minister — elected, but just barely having any democratic legitimacy — was involved, reading one of the weird stories from the strange Christian book, <cite>The Bible</cite>. But look at the start of the ceremony. The military led the march to the church, surrounding the coffin throughout. Just inside the doorway they handed over to the religionists, who led them down the aisle.</p>
<p>All the living Prime Ministers were there, and some other politicians too, I expect. But it was not a day for them, for the elected; nor for their electors, for &lsquo;commoners&rsquo;, except to bow their heads and throw flowers.</p>
<p>I kept an eye on Twitter throughout, but it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as snarky as I imagined. A few comments about dropped papers and spiders, but mostly just revelling in it.</p>

			 <p>So we move into a(nother) period of rereading. Reading the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/09/12/the-ink-black.html">new Strike novel</a> immediately made me want to go back to the start. Mainly, I think, because I wanted to stay with these characters. As I type I&rsquo;ve just finished the second in the series.</p>
<p>The characters, though, are very different back here. Well, Strike not so much. Robin is new-minted, still unformed, and doesn&rsquo;t get nearly as much pagetime as she deservedly does in later books.</p>
<p>Good stuff, this tale of a famous model who dies in a fall from a balcony. The police have written it off as suicide, but Strike, when asked to investigate, has other ideas.</p>
<p>Keeping the whodunit alive, I had completely forgotten who actually was the guilty party. Or rather, I remembered it as being someone other than it was. So I was surprised by it, which you don&rsquo;t really expect on a rereading.</p>

<p>Aaron Sorkin not quite at his best. Decent film, based on the memoir of Molly Bloom. Who is nothing to do with <cite>Ulysses</cite>, but parents who either were huge James Joyce fans, or had no knowledge of him whatsoever. I lean toward the latter.</p>
<p>She nearly becomes an Olympic skier, but is put out of action by injury. She falls into helping to run a poker game for extremely rich people. Takes it over and it becomes even bigger, even richer.</p>
<p>Even more dangerous. The mob gets involved. The FBI get involved.</p>
<p>Great dialogue, as you&rsquo;d expect, but mostly presented by characters who are seated, rather than walking at high speed. Perhaps playing poker while walking at high speed would have improved the whole thing.</p>
<p>Not bad, though.</p>

			 <p>This may be the best so far of the Strike books. My favourite so far, anyway.</p>
<p>Despite being set in 2015 (time flows differently in Galbraith world) it&rsquo;s very much of now. People being bullied online, right-wing terrorist organisations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossrail">Crossrail</a> still being built. Oh wait, they finished that. If the novels ever catch up with reality, Cormoran and Robin won&rsquo;t have to pick their way past roadworks around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_Street">Denmark Street</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://strikefans.com/the-tottenham-pub/">The Tottenham</a> pub won&rsquo;t be there any more. What will Strike do then? Well, OK, he&rsquo;ll just complain about it being renamed The Flying Horse, I imagine. I think I was in The Tottenham once, years and years ago, and didn&rsquo;t think too much of it. But who knows.</p>
<p>Anyway, the book! Yes, it is excellent. I loved it. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t like was the sheer physical size. It&rsquo;s over 1000 pages, and when it&rsquo;s not breaking your wrists, it feels like it&rsquo;s breaking its own spine.</p>
<p>The titular Ink-Black Heart (it should, of course, be hyphenated, as an adjectival phrase) is a cartoon series, initially on YouTube, moved to Netflix. Having read the description, I really want to see it.</p>
<p>It spawns a fan-created game, and therein lies the problem. Fans, you know? They can be troublesome types. Even dangerous.</p>
<p>Parts of the book are presented as in-game chat threads, with up to three streams running in parallel down the pages. It could get very confusing. It doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Read.</p>

			 <p>Yes, I&rsquo;m only reading Iain Banks at the moment. What of it? Or I was for a brief period up until the book after this.</p>
<p>Probably my favourite Culture novel, and possibly the best. Mainly because the ships are most prominent and coolest and it&rsquo;s all just huge <em>fun</em>!</p>
<p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2013/10/16/201431.html">talked about it back in 2013</a> god how can this have been going on for so long? Where by &lsquo;this&rsquo; I mean <a href="/blog/tag/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a>. On the other hand, I suppose as long as I reread his books, it&rsquo;ll be going on, no matter how many &rsquo;re-' prefixes we might want to apply.</p>
<p>There are a couple, though none of the SF, that I&rsquo;ve still only read once. I think maybe literally a couple: <cite>Stonemouth</cite> and <cite>The Quarry</cite>. And one, the poetry collection (with <a href="/blog/tag/ken-macleod/">Ken McLeod</a>), that I&rsquo;ve only partly read.</p>
<p>But anyway, <a href="https://theculture.fandom.com/wiki/Excession_(novel)"><cite>Excession</cite></a>: pure dead brilliant. If by some odd means you&rsquo;ve read his SF and haven&rsquo;t got to this yet, you have a treat in store for you. Or if you&rsquo;re just starting out. Or if you&rsquo;re re-re-rereading, like me.</p>
<p>The Culture meet an object? Entity? Being? That they don&rsquo;t understand and can&rsquo;t cope with. An <a href="https://theculture.fandom.com/wiki/Outside_Context_Problem">Outside Context Problem</a>, as they call it. It&rsquo;s excessive, so it&rsquo;s an excession. Things are set in motion. (Some of them very very fast things.)</p>

			 <p>Banksie&rsquo;s most political book, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say. In the sense that the real-world politics and opinions of the author and the first-person narrator most closely align, and that it was written at about the time it is set and is often <em>about</em> the time it was written, as well.</p>
<p>It starts on 9/11, though that tragic event is only background. A London-based Scottish radio DJ and commentator gets up to mischief and into trouble.</p>
<p>It stands up well twenty years on.</p>

			 <p>The last of the Culture books and Banksie&rsquo;s SF books, both at all, and that I had only read once.</p>
<p>The odd one about this, as a Culture book, I realised only very late on, is that neither Special Circumstances nor even Contact are involved, directly. Just a random grouping of ships who take an interest in the matter.</p>
<p>The matter in question being the decision of a species called the Gzilt to sublime, or leave the material realm for higher dimensions. This a common endpoint (or new beginning) for civilisations in the Culture universe, and I wonder whether, had Iain lived, he would have taken us to the point where The Culture itself was making that decision.</p>
<p>Anyway, the sonata in question is one that is barely playable because it was written for &lsquo;an instrument not yet invented&rsquo;, which turns out to be be the Antagonistic Undecagonstring, or Elevenstring. An instrument with some 24 strings (some not counted in the name, because they are not played, they just resonate) designed to be played with two bows simultaneously.</p>
<p>Our hero — or at least, the main humanoid viewpoint character — Vyr Cossont, has been surgically adapted to have an extra pair of arms to allow her to play it. It is still next to impossible, but she has made it her &lsquo;life task&rsquo;: something to do while waiting for the day when your civilisation sublimes. The decision for them to go was made long before she was born.</p>
<p>But her playing the sonata is only a side issue. The real problem is that maybe someone is trying to sabotage the sublimation. Or maybe not, but odd things are afoot, and various people and ships get involved, and it&rsquo;s all a whole shitload of fun.</p>

			 <p>On <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">my MA course</a>, in the Creative Nonfiction module, we were assigned the first chapter of this as one of our readings. It intrigued me enough that I ordered a copy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pagesofhackney.co.uk">Pages of Hackney</a> had to order it from the US, and it took a long time to arrive. The module (and possibly the course, though I don&rsquo;t actually think so) had finished by the time it arrived.</p>
<p>It took me even longer to finish reading it, despite it being a very slim volume.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s subtitled &lsquo;The Art of Personal Memoir&rsquo;. She starts one section by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thirty years ago people who thought they had a story to tell sat down to write a novel. Today they sit down to write a memoir.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it was published in 2001, so she was seeing a change since the seventies. That may be even more true now, as creative nonfiction, memoir, the confessional story: that&rsquo;s a huge publishing category.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure to what extent this book will help people who want to sit down and write one.</p>
<p>Gornick likes to teach by example. I would estimate that between 40 and 50% of the words in this book are other people&rsquo;s. All properly cited and credited, of course, and the relevant permissions listed at the back. But she uses huge long quotes.</p>
<p>Nothing inherently wrong with that, of course. How else do we first learn to write at all, other than by the examples of things we read? But I felt she spent too much time quoting the examples, and not enough explaining <em>why</em> she chose those. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe use smaller examples, or break the big quotes up with interjections on technique.</p>
<p>Early in the book she talks about the nonfiction writer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here the the writer must identify openly with those very same defenses [<em>sic</em>] and embarrassments that the novelist or the poet is once removed from. It&rsquo;s like lying down on the couch in public … Think about how many years on the couch it takes to speak about oneself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The casual synecdoche of &lsquo;couch&rsquo; to mean &lsquo;therapy&rsquo; or &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; amused me. So commonplace must analysis be in her circles, that she assumes everyone knows what &lsquo;lying down on the couch&rsquo; is like. Whereas most of us, I would guess, only know about it from seeing it in films.</p>

			 <p>Not strictly a book, but a <a href="https://interzone.press">double issue of a short-story magazine</a> seems substantial enough to treat as one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when the last issue came out, but I had actually forgotten that I still had a subscription. It was good to get this, not least because it&rsquo;s going to be the last to be edited by Andy Cox and published by TTA Press — <cite>Interzone</cite> 2.0, we might call it, after the David Pringle years.</p>
<p>From the next issue the editor will be Gareth Jelley, and the publisher MYY Press. The surprising thing about that is that the press is based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw">Wrocław</a>, in Poland. Which is odd because then, is it a British SF magazine anymore?</p>
<p>That probably doesn&rsquo;t matter, because of course it&rsquo;s an international genre, and it&rsquo;s not like they ever only published British writers. But still, quite a dramatic shift. It&rsquo;ll be intersting to see how the magazine changes.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this a lot. There was perhaps too much <a href="https://twitter.com/glassworks18">Alexander Glass</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> — three stories and an interview — but I guess sometimes you have a special focus for an issue (or two). And they&rsquo;re all good.</p>
<p>Several of the stories suffer from something I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/2014/07/21/notexactlybooks-what-has.html">complained about before</a>, which is to say, they don&rsquo;t have endings. Or, put another way, the authors chose to end them at a point that I find unsatisfying; or I don&rsquo;t understand <em>why</em> they chose to end there.</p>
<p>But in this case, I don&rsquo;t think any of the ending-choices let the stories down too. much.</p>

			 <p>This starts out with the main character escaping from some obscure threat and reaching a friend&rsquo;s place. The friend sends him into the past — so you think it&rsquo;s going to be a time-travel story. In the past he tries to save a struggling artist by giving him gold.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the last we hear of time travel. It&rsquo;s actually a story of humans who have attained bodily immortality through various traumatic incidents, and things going on with them. There&rsquo;s some space travel, and, not surprisingly given the tite, a computer connection.</p>

Certainly the <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/christopher-priest/">ones that I&rsquo;ve tagged with his name</a> are all outside of that loosely-connected set. But you can&rsquo;t have been interested in <a href="/blog/tag/sf">SF</a> as long as I have and not be aware of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://christopher-priest.co.uk/books/the-islanders-2">This one</a>, though, well.</p>
<p>Its conceit is that it is a gazeteer of the Dream Archipelago (which is, I&rsquo;m slightly surprised to discover, what its residents call it: I had thought it was more… <em>dreamy</em> than that).</p>
<p>The archipelago is essentially impossible to map, because of some kind of time-distorting vortices that occur over the world it is on. No one is sure how many islands there are or the names or locations of even the main ones. The writers of the gazeteer try their best in any case.</p>
<p>By way of the would-be-factual entries, plus a number of fairly straightforward short stories (which don&rsquo;t fit the gazeteer format, but then nothing really &lsquo;fits&rsquo; here) we get something of the backstory of the archipelago, and fragments of the lives of a few of its prominent citizens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all highly readable and makes me want to know more about this odd world and its people (who seem to be essentially human).</p>

			 <p>&lsquo;<a href="https://www.valmcdermid.com/still-life/">A Karen Pirie thriller</a>,&rsquo; the description on the cover says of this. I&rsquo;m not sure &lsquo;thriller&rsquo; is quite the right term. It&rsquo;s exciting enough, but there isn&rsquo;t the tension that would take it up to &lsquo;thriller&rsquo; level. Not least because Karen Pirie is never in any danger, other than possibly pissing off her boss, the deputy chief constable of Police Scotland.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read Val McDermid before, so picking up one of her later ones — possibly her latest: published in 2020, set just before the pandemic, and ending as lockdown starts — would be a strange choice. But sometimes you&rsquo;re in a holiday house and there are some books and it&rsquo;s not so much a choice as an offering. I&rsquo;ve fancied checking out some <em>tartan noir</em> for a while, anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. I enjoy a crime novel from time to time, and this one certainly kept the pages turning. Backstory was filled in very efficiently, without it feeling like infodumping. And reading about the chill autumn in Scotland (with slight detours into France, the north of England, and Ireland) took the edge off some of the Greek heat.</p>
<p>The title is a little confusing. There is some art involved in the story, but none of it is a still life. There&rsquo;s at least a double meaning to the phrase, of course, and that makes sense in context. But maybe the French term, <em>nature mort</em>, is even more applicable. Not least since Karen Pirie works cold cases for the Scottish police force.</p>

			 <p>Greece is probably the best place to read <a href="https://pollysamson.com/books.htm">this novel</a>, which is good, because that was where I was when I read it. It&rsquo;s a work of fiction mostly set on the real island of Hydra during 1960-61. There was a famous community of anglophone expats there at the time, one of whom was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Ihlen">Marianne Ihlen</a>. They were notably joined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Cohen">Leonard Cohen</a>.</p>
<p>The first-person narrator is fictional, but nearly every other character is real. It&rsquo;s an unusual approach for a contemporary novel, though perhaps not for historical fiction. Which, at sixty years distance, you could consider this. Some of the people are still alive, though, which is probably what makes it feel a bit odd.</p>
<p>Not Leonard or Marianne, though. The books starts with the narrator visiting Cohen&rsquo;s old house on the morning after his death was announced. Which — and I had forgotten this — was just after Trump got elected. Everything else is flashback.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very good. Captures the feeling of a Greek island summer, the listlessness of the young drifters, and the bitterness of the older writers who still struggle for success.</p>

			 <p>Or the first two books in <a href="https://www.rudyrucker.com/wares/">the <cite>Ware</cite> tetralogy</a>, as they now are. I read <cite>Software</cite> many years ago, and enjoyed it, though not as much as some of Rucker&rsquo;s others, notably <cite>White Light</cite>.</p>
<p>This time round it was fine, and so was the second one, but not really anything to write home about. I&rsquo;ll read the other two, since I&rsquo;ve got the combined edition on my Kindle, and they&rsquo;re not very long. But there&rsquo;s a spark that Rucker has when he writes about things like infinities, that just isn&rsquo;t there when he writes about the themes here.</p>
<p>Which are artificial intelligence, machine sentience, and the possibility of transferring human consciousnesses into robot bodies and vice versa. Those are fascinating concepts, but the stories don&rsquo;t quite jump off the page enough for me.</p>

			 <p>I had associated this in my head with Dick&rsquo;s <cite>VALIS</cite>, which is one of his latest works (written 1978, published 1981, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valis_(novel_series)">according to Wikipedia</a>). I think just because of the similarity of names.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik"><cite>Ubik</cite></a> is in fact more of a mid-period novel (written 1966, published 1969), and it shows. Though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik">according to the Wikipedia entry</a>, &lsquo;it was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest novels since 1923.&rsquo; I find that a tad surprising, as it&rsquo;s far from one of his better ones to my mind.</p>
<p>Certainly some of his tropes are there: strange warps to reality, confusion over who is and isn&rsquo;t dead, that sort of thing. But it&rsquo;s just not as compelling as, say, <cite>Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said</cite>, or <cite>A Scanner Darkly</cite>; nor as weird and fascinating as <cite>VALIS</cite>.</p>
<p>The characterisation is weak — which is probably true for most of Dick&rsquo;s work, to be fair. But the story just doesn&rsquo;t really get off the ground.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/06/01/inverted-world-by.html">read <cite>Inverted World</cite></a> on the Kindle. It always annoys me that you&rsquo;re put at the start of the text on opening. I like to go back to the cover and work forward. Sometimes I use the contents links for that, and I think I might have done so here, skipping the introduction, because they nearly always contain spoilers.</p>
<p>So I started with the famous opening sentence I wrote about. But because I linked to the book&rsquo;s Wikipedia page, I skimmed the article. Which mentioned a prologue, that I had somehow missed.</p>
<p>As it happens, missing the prologue didn&rsquo;t really matter, didn&rsquo;t affect my enjoyment of the book. But first, I don&rsquo;t know how people can refer to the first sentence of Chapter 1 as the opening sentence, when there&rsquo;s a prologue full of sentences before it.</p>
<p>And second, be careful how you read your ebooks. You might miss something.</p>

			 <p>With its fairly famous opening line — &lsquo;I had reached the age of six hundred and fifty miles.&rsquo; — I kind of thought I had read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_World">this</a> before, long ago, maybe as a teenager. But no. It turned out definitely not.</p>
<p>A young man learns his place in a city — Earth City, as they call it — which is moving. Rails are placed before it and lifted up behind it so they can be laid in front again. The city is winched along on the rails by fits and starts. Why? Why is it in motion, and why do the inhabitants work desperately to keep it so? And why is the fact kept hidden from city dwellers who are not &lsquo;guildsmen&rsquo;?</p>
<p>The answers, or some of them, are within. Though there is no answer to why &lsquo;guildsmen&rsquo; is the correct word. Women are second-class citizens in the city. And worse outside it, on the whole.</p>
<p>The people of the city are human, they speak English mostly. They know their ancestors were from Earth planet, as they refer to it. The people in the villages they pass also seem to be human, and they mostly speak Spanish. The sun appears not as a sphere, but as a kind of disk with spikes top and bottom. What can be going on? The title suggests some kind of inversion, but what is it?</p>
<p>Ultimately the mystery isn&rsquo;t solved in a very interesting way, and the ending is sad, but maybe happy, but maybe sad.</p>
<p>Priest has written much better books, but it bears reading.</p>

			 <p>This was prompted by a <cite>Guardian</cite> article — listicle, you might say, since it&rsquo;s basically a big list — of books for the summer (last summer): <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/summer-reading-the-50-hottest-new-books-everyone-should-read">Summer reading: the 50 hottest new books everyone should read</a>. I borrowed it from my local library. Kind of great that you can borrow ebooks from the library. Especially during lockdowns, when the buildings themselves were closed.</p>
<p>It is a magic realist novel set mostly in Britain and faerie; or the <em>sidhe</em>, as it&rsquo;s called here. It starts with the story of the tragic death of the main character&rsquo;s sister, when they were both in their late teens or early twenties. Was it murder? certainly the driver of the car that killed her was imprisoned.</p>
<p>The loss of her sister haunts Taryn&rsquo;s life, predictably. But if there are hints that the death is somehow linked to the other mysteries that run through the book, then it is never satisfactorily resolved that there is or isn&rsquo;t any connection.</p>
<p>That aside, we soon find ourselves — unexpectedly, for me at least — in another world. It seems that all the otherworlds exist: Munin and Huggin, Odin&rsquo;s ravens, turn up. We hear that &lsquo;The Great God of the Deserts&rsquo; went mad because his believers had too many different ideas of what he was like, so heaven is closed. A visit to purgatory is made.</p>
<p>Taryn finds out she is damned, because of an action she took — or didn&rsquo;t take, a sin of omission — regarding her sister&rsquo;s killer. And seems to accept this, and another evil at the heart of the Sidhe, without trying to understand it, without raging against it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, but there are definite weaknesses. I found the action scenes very confusing. Some of the geographical descriptions, too. And it feels a bit… maybe <em>unfocused</em> is the word? Hard to say what exactly I mean by that, but I guess it&rsquo;s that some things are hinted at when they should be explained. At least eventually.</p>
<p>There are a few oddities. It&rsquo;s set mostly in Britain, but some Americanisms creep in where they wouldn&rsquo;t. Can&rsquo;t think of any specific examples, but it&rsquo;s on the level of saying &lsquo;highway&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;motorway&rsquo;. That kind of thing.</p>
<p>Well worth a look, though.</p>

			 <p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to write anything about Elon Musk buying Twitter, because I mostly don&rsquo;t care. But Robin Sloan, in his newsletter, which isn&rsquo;t really a newsletter, because he just sends a link to a <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lostthread/">blog post</a> (with a few added words), says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An industrialist intends to purchase Twitter, Inc. His substantial success launching reusable spaceships does nothing to prepare him for the challenge of building social spaces. The latter calls on every liberal art at once, while the former is just rocket science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to quote that because I loved &lsquo;just rocket science.&rsquo; The common expression, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not rocket science&rsquo; has always mildly amused me, as a physics graduate. Because rocket science is <em>relatively</em> both simple and easy. It&rsquo;s straightforward Newtonian physics. Mass. Acceleration. Forces. The physics is simple, the sums are easy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go anywhere near even Special Relativity (still straightforward, if harder), General Relativity (much more complex), or of course anywhere close to quantum physics (frankly the most complex and confusing thing of all).</p>
<p>All of which is just to say that physics has more and less difficult areas. Rocket <em>engineering</em>, of course, is quite another matter. There you&rsquo;ve got all sort of complex materials science, chemistry, end even — if crew are involved — biology, sociology, psychology. Those are <em>much</em> harder.</p>
<p>As far as common similes for the ease of something go, I&rsquo;ve always preferred &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not brain surgery.&rsquo;  If I think about it I&rsquo;m amazed that operating successfully on a living human brain is even possible, and I bow my head to those who can do it. While hoping they&rsquo;ll never have to go near said bowed object, of course.</p>
<p>Anyway, that would have been that for this post, except that I pasted the above quote from Sloan into a text editor. But it didn&rsquo;t look like it does above. It looked like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>An indus-tri-al-ist intends to pur-chase Twit-ter, Inc. His sub-stan-tial suc-cess launch-ing reusable space-ships does noth-ing to pre-pare him for the chal-lenge of build-ing social spaces. The lat-ter calls on every lib-eral art at once, while the for-mer is just rocket science.
</code></pre><p>Where did all those hyphens come from? They look like they&rsquo;re non-printing characters. Ones that won&rsquo;t show up when a web page is rendered, but are there in the source code. Why? I can only imagine two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>a deliberate ploy to make it harder to copy quotes, as I have done above. But Sloan is a pro-web kinda guy, as far as I can tell. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like something he&rsquo;d do.</li>
<li>A glitch. An artifact of the software he used to create the post. It&rsquo;s most likely that. Weird one, though.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stranger still is that the character is not even a hyphen. As I discovered when I search-and-replaced it in BBEdit, it actually appears to be this: <code>\x{AD}</code>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that is. Some kind of hexadecimal representation of something. An invisible hyphen, presumably. Which I had to search-and-replace with actual hyphens to make them visible above. Looking at the source code, it&rsquo;s written as the HTML entity <code>&amp;shy;</code>, which the DuckDuck tells me is a &lsquo;soft hyphen&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All very odd.</p>
<p>I have positive feelings about Sloan, except for his closing image. I&rsquo;ll risk another paste:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wishful descriptions of Twitter as 	<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1507777261654605828">“the de facto public town square”</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1518772753460998145">“the closest thing we have to a global consciousness”</a> sound, to me, like Peter Pan begging the audience to clap and raise a swooning Tinkerbell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don’t have to clap.</p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, but… of <em>course</em> you have to clap. Without wanting to get all metaphysical on you, if you don&rsquo;t clap when Tinkerbell is dying, you&rsquo;ve got no soul.</p>

			 <p>This came to me by way of <cite>The Guardian</cite>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/summer-reading-the-50-hottest-new-books-everyone-should-read">summer reading</a> recommendations last year. I ended up reading it in the tail end of winter, or spring, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/15/luckenbooth-by-jenni-fagan-review-brilliantly-strange?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">his review</a>, M John Harrison describes it as &lsquo;brilliantly strange&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s about right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tale told across times, and tied to place. That place is number 10 Luckenbooth Close, in Edinburgh. Just off The Royal Mile, in fact, which is a place I lived as a student. I was in an alley called James Court, though, not the fictional Luckenbooth Close.</p>
<p>The close may be fictional, but the idea is not: <a href="https://luckenboothsedinburgh.co.uk/history/">luckenbooths</a>  were a kind of market stall in the High Street (part of The Royal Mile). Presumably that&rsquo;s where Fagan got the street name from.</p>
<p>Though I discover today that a luckenbooth is <em>also</em> a piece of jewellery: a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luckenbooth_brooch">heart-shaped brooch</a> , named after the <a href="https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luckenbooths">market stalls</a> in turn.</p>
<p>The book, though, is about none of those things. Instead it&rsquo;s about a series of people who live in the titular tenement block across the centuries. We start with the Devil&rsquo;s daughter, who — well, I won&rsquo;t go into spoilery details. William Burroughs is one of the characters, strangely. Apparently he <a href="https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/06/10/burroughs-and-scotland/">did visit Edinburgh</a>.</p>
<p>It is an astonishing work, involving the saving of ghosts, murders, the Millennium celebrations, homelessness, and much more. Highly recommended.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a strange set of opinions popping up on Twitter over the last week or so, essentially blaming the US, the UK, and/or NATO for Putin&rsquo;s illegal and horrifying war on Ukraine. Which on the face of it is bizarre, at best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that NATO&rsquo;s expansion over the last couple of decades was unwise. Yet who could blame small countries close to Russia from seeking the protection that membership brings? Putin&rsquo;s belligerence was well known even before the current attack.</p>
<p>George Monbiot makes the point well in his excellent <cite>Guardian</cite> piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a strong argument that Nato should have been <a href="https://socialeurope.eu/what-is-nato-for">disbanded</a> at the end of the cold war. But while Putin’s sense of threat seems to have been heightened by Nato expansion and mission creep, Nato expansion has also been driven in part by Putin’s belligerence. Are we really to believe that Estonia and Latvia joined because they wanted to attack Russia? On the contrary, it’s because they fear attack. While Nato’s growth is likely to have contributed to the crisis, it’s ridiculous to suggest that Russia is not the aggressor.</p>
<p>&ndash; George Monbiot, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin">We must confront Russian propaganda – even when it comes from those we respect</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He suggests that Russian propaganda is at least partly to blame. It seems have made inroads on the left. Monbiot mentions the Stop the War Coalition, which normally we would think is an admirable goal and organisation. But their recent <a href="https://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/list-of-signatories-stop-the-war-statement-on-the-crisis-over-ukraine/">letter</a> claims the British government &lsquo;have poured oil on the fire throughout this episode.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m no supporter of Johnson or the Tories, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair. They also say that they &lsquo;do not endorse the nature or conduct of either the Russian or Ukrainian regimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the Ukrainians have done except prepare to defend themselves, and then do so. I&rsquo;m as against war as any former CND member from the eighties, but when a country is invaded, it has a right to fight back.</p>
<p>Monbiot says it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True anti-imperialism means opposing not only the west’s imperialism, essential as this is. It’s about opposing all imperialism, whether western, Russian, Chinese or other.</p>
<p>&ndash; George Monbiot, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin">As before</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As always, of course, it is the ordinary people who suffer. I recommend donating if you can, to one of the organisations working to help the people of Ukraine:</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever written about a book of poetry here before. That&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t read that much of it. Whenever I do, I think, &lsquo;I should read more poetry.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/the-kids-1277">This</a> won the Costa, but that&rsquo;s not the main reason I picked it up. The author, Hannah Lowe, was a tutor on my <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma">MA course</a>. She taught my Creative Nonfiction (CNF) module. Which sounds a long way from poetry, but a person can have skills in more than one type of writing. She was very good as a tutor, and in fact I got my highest single mark in CNF.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very short and easy read, but some of the poems go to some dark places. Others — most, I&rsquo;d say — are highly positive and life-affirming. They were inspired by her time teaching sixth formers in English schools. Which made me wonder on my CNF class chat, should we be worried about what her <em>next</em> collection&rsquo;s going to be about?</p>
<p>Hopefully she won&rsquo;t repeat herself. These are all sonnets, or in one cases a series of sonnets under one title, and very good, as the awards people clearly think.</p>

			 <p>Posting about books is slow because I&rsquo;m reading something gigantic. More of that later (possibly much later). But in the interstices, a return to <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a>). My friend <a href="https://buggerdefanoblog.wordpress.com">John</a> mentioned recently that he had just read this for the first time, which prompted me to revisit it (that, and perhaps some great whisky I got for Christmas).</p>
<p>Mildly surprised to realise that when I wrote about it before in <a href="https://devilgate.org/2003/12/22/the-whisky-post.html">The Whisky Post</a> it was not one of my typical book posts. I guess in 2003 I wasn&rsquo;t doing that. It was just over 18 years ago. Wow.</p>
<p>I concur with my earlier opinion, but note this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Banks gives us a brief overview of the steps in the distilling process, fairly early on, and then makes appropriate use of the various technical terms during later distillery visits. All fair enough. But there is one term for part of distillery’s apparatus — the <a href="http://www.whiskymag.com/words/lyne_arm.html">lyne arm</a> — that he starts referring to without ever explaining what it is (I’m fairly sure: it is possible that I just missed that explanation, but I don’t think so).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I offer an eighteen-year-late correction: he <em>does</em> define the <a href="https://scotchwhisky.com/magazine/ask-the-professor/19310/secrets-of-the-lyne-arm/">lyne arm</a> on first use. I must have missed it the first time. And I note with mild but resigned annoyance that the link in the quote above is dead, even though the site, <a href="https://whiskymag.com">Whisky Magazine</a>, is not.</p>
<p>Anyway, well worth a look if you haven&rsquo;t read it. You may not learn  <em>that</em> much about malts, and the scene has changed a lot over the time, but it&rsquo;s still a joy to spend time with him.</p>
<p>And it seems like Glenfiddich no longer make the Havana Reserve expression. If you search for it online there are prices quoted of around £400 a bottle(!), though no actual bottles for sale. Which is a shame, because it was good, and I&rsquo;m sure it would still sell if they made it. Maybe they stopped being able to get the rum barrels.</p>

<p>Wordle 227 2/6</p>
<p>
🟨🟨⬛🟩🟩<br>🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
</p>
<p>The first time I&rsquo;ve got it on the second line.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t blame Josh Wardle for making a ton of money out of it, it does perhaps slightly undercut the narrative over the last few weeks about how he did it for his partner and for fun. But like I say, who can blame him?</p>
<p>It does seem likely that the <cite>NYT</cite> will put it behind their paywall eventually. As they did with the formerly-free review site <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/">The Wirecutter</a> when they bought it, for example. Which would be a shame.</p>
<p>Something I meant to write about before, but never got round to, was how all the mainstream press wrote about it. They made it hard to find, and, I think, helped to encourage the scammy app store rip-off versions. Because they (mostly, from what I saw) did not say that it was a web-based game, and worse, <em>they didn&rsquo;t link to it</em>. That&rsquo;s sloppy at best.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems I&rsquo;ve done it successfully for 21 days in a row:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turn_of_the_Screw">This extremely short book</a> is only a novella, but it took me some time to get through it because of the density and obscurity of the prose. James is, I think, notorious for writing long sentences, but that&rsquo;s only part of it. It&rsquo;s the textural density, the complexity, and, I think, the wilfully archaic (even for the time) formulations, that make it hard work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ghost story, though the status of the ghostly presences is disputed, or at least discussed: are they all in the governess&rsquo;s mind? The bulk of the tale is the first-person narrative of the governess, but it starts with an odd framing sequence of tales being told round a Christmas-eve fireplace. One of the company is reminded of a manuscript he has, and sends for it. The rest is him &lsquo;reading&rsquo; from it. And I&rsquo;m not sure that &lsquo;framing&rsquo; is the right term here, because we never return to the reading party. It seems like a device to let James write from the point of view of a woman.</p>
<p>Once you attune yourself to the style, it&rsquo;s pretty compelling. Chilling in places.</p>

			 <p>Ken <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/2021/12/beyond-hallowed-sky.html">posted about this on his blog</a>, along with a link to the <a href="https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/beyond-the-hallowed-sky/">first chapter on the publisher&rsquo;s site</a>. I read the chapter and instantly ordered the book from <a href="https://www.pagesofhackney.co.uk">my local bookshop</a>. Finished it on New Year&rsquo;s Day, so it counts as 2021.</p>
<p>He describes it as &lsquo;the first volume of the Lightspeed Trilogy&rsquo;, and adds that &lsquo;the second volume is well underway.&rsquo; Which is fine, but I usually make it a rule not to start unfinished serieses. So not so much a rule as a preference, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>This particular book ends in a way that is satisfactorily complete, but open enough for the followups to go in all sorts of directions. Plenty of unanswered questions, but none so burning that the wait should be annoying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s set in 2070, after that initial chapter which is three years earlier. Humanity is about to develop lightspeed travel. Or it already has. What intelligences will be waiting out there? Some people think the answer is &lsquo;none&rsquo;, because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">the Fermi Paradox</a>.</p>
<p>The political situation is interesting. The countries of the world have largely coalesced into three blocks: the Alliance, which is the Anglosphere minus Scotland and Ireland, but including India; the Union, which is most of Europe including Scotland and Ireland; and the Coordinated States, which is Russia and China. We don&rsquo;t hear anything about Africa or the Middle East. There has been (or is ongoing) an event called the Cold Revolution.</p>
<p>Also artificial intelligences are commonplace, including androids that are essentially indistinguishable from humans.</p>
<p>And if you need to build a starship, obviously you&rsquo;re going to add the FTL drive to a submarine. And where do you build such ships? On the Clyde, of course. A lot of this is set in places from my childhood, which is fun for me.</p>

<p>Happy New Year to one and all. Who knows what 2022 will bring, but let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s at least some relief from the difficulties of 2020 and 2021. But the coronavirus doesn&rsquo;t care about calendars, and neither does viral evolution.</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;re dealing with family photos back in the seventies, eighties, nineties, it&rsquo;s great that you write the date and place on the back (thanks, Mum). That&rsquo;s super useful. But could you please name the event and the <em>people</em>, too?</p>
<p>Yes, of course, you know what it was and who they were. But you&rsquo;re not writing it for you. You&rsquo;re writing it for your descendants, decades later, who want to know who these people were.</p>
<p>Why yes, I <em>am</em> scanning some old family photos, why do you ask?</p>
<p>Oh, and also: don&rsquo;t waste film on scenery. The Scottish hills and moors are lovely, but I&rsquo;m not interested in scanning old photos of them. Give me people, family, friends. Give me backgrounds, the wallpaper in the old house. Show me bookcases, wood-effect stereo systems. Old streets and shop signs.</p>
<p>And people, above all, people: that&rsquo;s what casual photography should be for.</p>
<p>You know what no one took pictures of in the film days? Food. I&rsquo;d actually love to see some old Sunday roasts or birthday cakes, but I don&rsquo;t suppose they&rsquo;d look that different from today&rsquo;s.</p>

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/12/28/planetfall-by-emma-newman-books/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-12-28 01:14:15 &#43;0100">Dec 28, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="http://www.enewman.co.uk/books-index/books/planetfall">This is a novel</a> about a human colony on an unnamed planet. There are, as we soon learn from the first-person narrator, Renata, lies and mysteries at the heart of the colony. Not least of those is how and why the humans came to live on this particular planet, in this particular place.</p>
<p>The place is at the foot of a mountain-like, biological, probably engineered structure they call the &lsquo;City of God&rsquo;. Twenty years ago — or more: the colony has existed for twenty years, but it&rsquo;s not clear how long the journey through space took — a small group of humans managed to get there in a spaceship. They were led by &lsquo;The Pathfinder&rsquo;, a woman who, we discover through flashbacks, knew what planet to head for because of a revelation she had had after ingesting the seed of a mysterious plant.</p>
<p>The intrigue of the novel is about how that backstory and the rest is filled in, how the colony keeps going, and what happens in the &lsquo;now&rsquo; of the story, when a mysterious human arrives.</p>
<p>How they designed and built a ship capable of getting there is not explained, and how far away from Earth it is is never stated. But I don&rsquo;t think Newman really understands the scales applicable to astronomical distances. On several occasions characters refer to having travelled (or in flashback, being about to travel) &lsquo;millions of miles&rsquo; to get to the new planet.</p>
<p>Our sun is 93 million miles from the Earth. If we&rsquo;re talking about distances that are sensibly expressed in terms of millions of miles, then we&rsquo;re talking about places <em>inside our own solar system</em>. And this is definitely not that.</p>
<p>Just to check, I asked Siri how far in miles it is to Alpha Centauri. It looked up <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=miles+to+alpha+centauri">Wolfram Alpha</a> and told me, &lsquo;About 25.8 trillion miles.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the closest star system to our own. It&rsquo;s not <em>wrong</em> to call that &lsquo;millions of miles&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s not exactly accurate. A trillion, after all, is a million million. And that&rsquo;s just the closest system.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t affect the story, but it&rsquo;s a weird thing for an SF writer to have missed, for no beta reader to have picked up, for an editor working at an SF publisher not to have caught.</p>
<p>Other than that, she does a great job of telling a first-person narrative from the point of view of someone who has some mental issues. All narrators are unreliable, and perhaps this one more so than usual. So we wonder how much we can rely on her telling of  what happens, especially at the end.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a religious background to this: the Pathfinder believed — and convinced those who came with her — that they would find God in the mysterious &lsquo;city&rsquo;. Did they? Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of a four-book series, which apparently can be read in any order. The next one (in terms of when they were written) looks like it takes place back on Earth, so we may learn nothing more about what happened in the colony, which was cut off from home.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/hench-natalie-zina-walschots?variant=33021717381154">The title comes from &lsquo;henchman&rsquo; — or -woman</a>. We are in a world where superheroes exist, and thereby, also super villains. Anna Tromedlov works as a &lsquo;hench&rsquo; — or tries to. As the novel starts she&rsquo;s using a temp agency, trying to pick up work.</p>
<p>At first it seems to be a comedy, but then she&rsquo;s at a press conference given by the villain she&rsquo;s working for, when the heroes arrive. Things get a lot darker.</p>
<p>Are superheroes, with their disregard for public safety, the real danger in a world like this? This novel takes a good look at that question, with accompanying adventure, threat, and romance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/19/failure-cascades/#natalie-zina-walschots">Cory Doctorow recommended it</a>.</p>
<p>If she didn&rsquo;t start out planning to call herself &lsquo;The Palindrome&rsquo;, would you ever think to read her surname backwards?</p>

<p>Four adult sisters are making their different ways in the world, but their mother disappeared a year ago. Ghosts and the spirits of stars sometimes wander the family home, where one of the sisters still lives, and the others come and go. A comet is due in the sky soon, and magic threats appear to be building.</p>
<p>Magic realism, you could call it, in the sense that it&rsquo;s set in the real worlds and magic is just <em>there</em>, for this family and a few other people at least. Everyday problems of relationships and such are part of it. The boyfriend of one of the sisters is a ghost.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it, and will probably read the sequel, which is out. My main problem with it was that the four sisters' voices weren&rsquo;t distinctive enough. The story is told from their multiple viewpoints. This is helpful to me, because it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m struggling with myself. Indeed, my <a href="/categories/cwma/">supervisor</a> suggested that maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have so many viewpoints.</p>

			 <h1 id="on-what-a-song-is">On What a Song Is</h1>
<p>It seems like I’m increasingly often hearing people — especially, but not exclusively, Americans — referring to things as ‘songs’ that are not, in fact, songs.
{.has-dropcap}</p>
<p>For example, <cite>Doctor Who</cite> does not have a theme song. Nor does <cite>Eastenders</cite> — though long ago a song using the <cite>Eastenders</cite> theme music made a dent in the UK charts.</p>
<p><cite>Red Dwarf</cite> and <cite>Firefly</cite>, to take two more science-fictional examples, <em>do</em> have theme songs.</p>
<p>Because here’s the truth of it: it’s not a song if it doesn’t have <em>words</em>. One or more human voices singing (because the verb <em>sing</em> goes with the noun <em>song</em>, obviously) is what is needed to make a piece of music into a song.</p>
<p>Those first examples above? Those are theme <em>tunes</em>. It’s not hard to understand the difference. For the <cite>Eastenders</cite>-based hit, somebody wrote words to go with the music; somebody <em>sang</em> it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of this as a recent thing, people referring as ‘songs’ to pieces of music without words. But I recalled why <cite>Eastenders</cite> came to mind. Long ago in the distant past (the 80s) I had a housemate who had an American girlfriend. That programme came on the telly, and she said, ‘Oh, I love this song.’</p>
<p>Much more recently, on the <a href="https://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast (ATP)</a>, John Siracusa was trying to locate a beeping sound that something in his basement was making.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It was a series of electronic tones, played in a melodic fashion. a little tune, in other words. But he repeatedly referred to it as a ‘song’. Which it very definitely was not.</p>
<h1 id="other-takes">Other Takes</h1>
<p>I’m not saying there are no grey areas here. What about the voice used as an instrument, where it only makes wordless tones; mouth-music, as we used to call it? Or pieces that are largely instrumental, but have one vocal piece thrown in, like Glenn Miller’s ‘Pennsylvania 65000’, where the band stop playing at a couple of points and shout the title?
{.has-dropcap}</p>
<p>Or Mendelssohn has a series of pieces entitled ‘Songs Without Words’. What are those, then?</p>
<p>Birdsong, or whale songs? The clue there is in the adjectives, of course: just as nut milk is a milk-like drink made from the relevant nut (or similarly, oats, soya, etc), so birdsong is a song-like thing made by a bird.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m seeing this as mainly an American thing, let’s <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/song">consult America’s favourite dictionary, Merriam-Webster</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="definition-of-_song_-noun">Definition of <em>song</em> (noun)</h2>
<ol>
<li>the act or art of singing</li>
<li>poetical composition</li>
<li>a) a short musical composition of words and music<br>
b) a collection of such compositions</li>
<li>a distinctive or characteristic sound or series of sounds (as of a bird, insect, or whale)</li>
<li>a) a melody for a lyric poem or ballad<br>
b) a poem easily set to music</li>
<li>a) a habitual or characteristic manner<br>
b) a violent, abusive, or noisy reaction (put up quite a song)</li>
<li>a small amount (sold for a song)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>3a is the key one in my argument, clearly. 5a moves disturbingly in the opposite direction, since it refers to ‘a melody’. But since the melody is specifically ‘for a lyric poem or ballad’, the fundamental need for words still stands.</p>
<p>In the end, if it hasn&rsquo;t got words, it&rsquo;s not worth a song.</p>

<p>Yes, we should be sending all this extra vaccine to poorer countries, because that would be the right thing to do, the moral thing. But even for self-preservation, we should be doing that. Every infected person is a mutation factory, so the fewer infected people there are in the world, the less chance there is of a mutation that&rsquo;s vaccine-resistant or worse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s self-preservation on a societal scale. But that same sense, at a personal level, lets me say, if they&rsquo;re offering it here, I&rsquo;m going to take it.</p>

Let&rsquo;s ignore the incorrect possessive apostrophe in the title<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>; it was the assertion about it breaking all the rules that drew me, made me want to read the article. A few paragraphs in I realised that I wanted to read the book, and the article was heading deep into spoiler territory. So I stopped reading it and downloaded the book. Read it as soon as I finished <a href="/blog/2021/11/26/the-caledonian-gambit-by-dan-moren-books-2021-23/">the last one</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the story of four neglected sisters, whose parents run a boys' boarding school and have no time for anything else, including their daughters; and of a ghost that is haunting them, and who might be one of them. And of an ancient darkness that the sisters accidentally invoked.</p>
<p>But the real darkness is the neglect.</p>
<p>Highly recommended, and the article I linked above is very good and insightful (but deeply spoilerific) too.</p>

			 <p>Dan Moren writes about Apple stuff over at <a href="https://sixcolors.com/about/">Six Colours</a>, and at <a href="https://www.macworld.com"><cite>Macworld</cite></a> and so on, but he&rsquo;s also an SF writer. This is his first novel, and there are already a couple of sequels. The series is described as &lsquo;The Galactic Cold War,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s a pretty good description.</p>
<p>There are several planets, linked by wormholes. From what I can tell, they&rsquo;re all originally Earth colonies, but there is at least one empire and one commonwealth, and Earth itself has been conquered by the empire. No aliens, at least so far.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good, in an &lsquo;SF meets cold-war thriller&rsquo; kind of way. There&rsquo;s nothing groundbreaking, but a set of characters I wouldn&rsquo;t mind spending more time with, and an intersting situation.</p>
<p>What struck me, as a Scot, was the &lsquo;Caledonian&rsquo; part. Moren is American, but he spent some time in Scotland. Caledonia is the name of one of the colony planets &ndash; predictably, the one where most of the action happens. Part of its capital city is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leith">Leith</a>. Just down the coast there&rsquo;s Berwick.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Various other towns or areas have names drawn from Scotland.

			 <p>We subscribed to Disney+ last night, so that we could watch Peter Jackson&rsquo;s <cite>The Beatles: Get Back</cite>. I had thought it was going to be a movie, but it turns out it&rsquo;s a miniseries: three two-hour episodes. The second drops today, and the third tomorrow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built from hours of footage that were recorded for the <cite>Let It Be</cite> documentary back in 1969. I remember watching that once and being disappointed by it. The main problem was that it was presented as a fly-on-the-wall thing, but the fly was aurally challenged.</p>
<p>In other words, you couldn&rsquo;t make out much of the chatter between the guys. That, almost as much as hearing them rehearsing and working on the songs, was kind of the point.</p>
<p>If you were making a documentary like that today you&rsquo;d probably have all the band members wearing microphone packs, as the participants in reality TV shows do, so that what they said would make it to storage. Back then, though, even if that had been practical,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> it was far from obvious that the individual Beatles would all have complied. Plus we&rsquo;d want to hear from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Epstein">Brian</a>,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Evans">Mal</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyn_Johns">Glyn</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin">the other George</a>, as well as John, Paul, George, and Ringo.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of microphone packs. So of course, the original producers relied on ambient miking. It&rsquo;s fine when the speaker is near one of the vocal mics, or when they&rsquo;re right under a boom, but otherwise… well, as I say, <cite>Let It Be</cite> was a frustrating experience.</p>
<p>However, technology has come a long, long, way in the succeeding fifty years. Every word in this is clear as a bell,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> undoubtedly with the help of modern digital audio editing. It&rsquo;s slightly ironic to note that one of the first things the band say is that the place they&rsquo;re working in &ndash; a warehouse in Twickenham &ndash; is acoustically bad. An odd choice of a place in which to work on writing and performing songs.</p>
<p>Anyway, as of the cliffhanger ending of episode one, this series is <em>fucking amazing</em>! Totally brilliant!</p>
<p>But only if you&rsquo;re a fan. If you only take a passing interest in The Beatles, or (weirdly) none at all, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t waste your time on this.</p>
<h2 id="the-disneyfication-of-christmas">The Disneyfication of Christmas</h2>
<p>Disney have made a genius move in launching this when they did. We will be far, far, from the only people who took out a subscription to watch this, with the intention of cancelling it after a month.</p>
<p>A month. What&rsquo;s a month after yesterday, the 25th of November? Oh yes.</p>
<p>All those subscriptions that are due to renew on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day? So many of them won&rsquo;t be cancelled, either just to have things to watch over Christmas, or to keep the kids happy, or because people will forget with everything else going on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll probably try to catch up on some of the newer Marvel and <cite>Star Wars</cite> stuff, of which there is just far, far, too much now, in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not too much Beatles.</p>

			 <p>I was surprised just over three weeks ago when I learned &ndash; from the Saturday <cite>Guardian</cite>, the physical newspaper, of all things &ndash; that <cite> Doctor Who</cite> was staring the next day. I was aware it was going to be happening this autumn, certainly, but somehow I&rsquo;d missed any hype about it online.</p>
<p>I was perhaps more surprised to learn that it was going to be a single story. Surprised, and pleased: a six-parter, just like the old days, like the ones I grew up with. Of course, back then you&rsquo;d get a few four-parters and maybe a six, all across what felt like many weeks. In this case, the six parts will make up the whole season. But still. There would be cliffhangers.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re three weeks in, halfway through.</p>
<p>There are cliffhangers. So many cliffhangers. Cliffs hung so thoroughly that the metaphor breaks down. The whole thing even started with The Doctor and Yaz hanging upside down. Not from a cliff, but still.</p>
<p>Hang those cliffs. The angels have the blue box.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> No, wait, that&rsquo;s for later. Or earlier. This time haze is getting to me.</p>
<p>This season, series, story, whatever you want to call it, is incredible. I am loving it. If they can hold up this quality, and especially give it a good ending &ndash; stick the landing, as people say for some (I believe <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/stick+the+landing">gymnastics-related</a>) reason &ndash; then it could be the high-water mark of <cite>Doctor Who</cite>.</p>
<p>And even if they don&rsquo;t manage a great ending, the ride will have been worthwhile.</p>
<p>But I want to get something out there before we get too much further into the series, and <strong>spoilers ahead</strong>, probably, so stop reading if you haven&rsquo;t seen at least up to episode 3, &lsquo;Once, Upon Time.&rsquo; Also if you think speculations can be spoilers. I, personally, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>OK, so, we&rsquo;ve seen glimpses of the Weeping Angels in these episodes. These creatures feed on time energy, and in this story, time energy is going wild, has been unleashed in dangerous ways. Whatever all that means (&lsquo;Time is evil,&rsquo; as one of the priest-triangles said).</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re seeing the origin of the Weeping Angels. Or we&rsquo;re going to see it. Something that happens in this story will bring the Angels into being. No idea what, mind you. I thought the Mouri in the Temple of Atropos might end up turning into them, but I think we&rsquo;ve moved away from there now.</p>
<p>Anyway, all is well in <cite>Who</cite>-land.</p>

			 <p>Talk about not remembering books: I&rsquo;ve got to ask myself whether I ever <em>did</em> read this one. I remembered one thing from it, but it&rsquo;s not how I remembered it. When people jack in to the matrix they use headsets &ndash; &lsquo;trodes&rsquo; &ndash;  with electrodes that connect to their temples.</p>
<p>There is a transition between the real world and cyberspace when they connect, and I had this memory of one cowboy (people who enter the matrix or cyberspace are called &lsquo;cowboys&rsquo; or &lsquo;jockeys&rsquo;) who had a set of trodes that made the transition feel like the world was falling apart. I&rsquo;ve been half waiting for that bit through these three books. Here&rsquo;s a quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Ready?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, and Tick&rsquo;s room was gone, its walls a flutter of cards, tumbling and receding, against the bright grid, the towering forms of data.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nice transition, that,&rsquo; she heard him say. &lsquo;Built into the trodes, that is. Bit of drama…&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that must be the bit I remembered, but if you had asked me I&rsquo;d have said I thought it came <a href="/blog/2021/10/30/count-zero-by-william-gibson-books-2021-21/">a book</a> or <a href="/blog/2021/10/13/neuromancer-by-william-gibson-books-2021-20/">two</a> earlier, and was mentioned more than once.</p>
<p>But what of the book itself? It keeps up the standard, maybe raises it slightly. We have four interconnected stories, four viewpoint characters, told in alternating chapters. One of the stories &ndash; that of Kumiko, who is experiencing the flutter of cards, above &ndash; isn&rsquo;t really relevant, in the sense that it doesn&rsquo;t drive the plot at all. Things that happen around her do affect the main plot, but she&rsquo;s not really aware of them.</p>
<p>What surprised me about this and the three books overall, is how much they really are a trilogy. I had the impression that they were considered only to be very loosely connected at best; essentially three stories set in the same <em>milieu</em>. But in fact not only do characters recur, everything here ties back to the events of <cite>Neuromancer</cite>, which happened some fourteen years before.</p>
<p>All very worth reading if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>

			 <p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard a song off an album &ndash; you&rsquo;ve heard the album, maybe a few times, but it&rsquo;s just kind of washed over you, not really made much of an impression &ndash; you hear a song, maybe on the radio, maybe some random or curated playlist, and you go. &lsquo;Wow! What a great song!&rsquo; And then you realise it&rsquo;s from <em>that</em> album, the one that washed over you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what singles were for. Still are for, since they&rsquo;re still released, though it&rsquo;s not quite the same.</p>
<p>I just had that experience with Radiohead. <cite>Kid A</cite> never made much of an impact on me, but when I turned <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_6music">BBC 6 Music</a> on tonight, a killer track was playing.  <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0072lb2">Steve Lamacq</a> back-announced it. He was playing the whole album, and the track was &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/i/1097863241">The National Anthem</a>.&rsquo; I knew <cite>Kid A</cite> had a track of that name, but it had never really got to me. But there, now, tonight, it was just amazing.</p>
<p>A similar, if inverted, effect is when the album is <em>so good</em> that it kind of drowns out a brillant single. I can only think of one example of that at the moment. If you cast your mind back (assuming it goes that far) to when The Jam released &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/i/1442461346">The Eton Rifles</a>,&rsquo; it was an incredible song.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://album.link/i/1442461170"><cite>Setting Sons</cite></a> is such a good album that I hardly notice &lsquo;The Eton Rifles&rsquo; on it.</p>
<p>Anyway. Singles. Yes.</p>

			 <p>I have a 15-inch MacBook Pro from 2017. It&rsquo;s in perfect working order, except the battery was past its best. &lsquo;Service recommended,&rsquo; it always said when I checked. But it was fine, I could get a couple of hours out of it, and I rarely use the computer away from somewhere I can plug in. Especially this last couple of years.</p>
<p>But the screen had developed a problem. There were marks on it that I couldn&rsquo;t remove. They were kind of hard to photograph, but you can see them here:</p>
<figure>
	<img src="uploads/2023/macbook-stains.jpeg" width="600" height="450" title="MacBook screen with delamination marks" alt="MacBook screen with delamination marks" loading="lazy" />
	<figcaption>MacBook screen with delamination marks</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I discovered there was a known defect in models of that era called &lsquo;screen delamination.&rsquo; The top layer of the screen&rsquo;s coating was becoming detached from the underlying one.</p>
<p>People had solutions, which involved careful cleaning with various solvents or mild abrasives: isopropyl alcohol, or, I don&rsquo;t know, toothpaste, maybe.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Inevitably, the whole affair has a &lsquo;gate&rsquo; name: <a href="https://boncode.hk/hk/blog/staingate/">Staingate</a>. Perhaps less inevitably, but unsurprisingly since it&rsquo;s a manufacturing defect, Apple have long since acknowledged the problem and offered a free repair programme. As long as your machine was no more than four years old.</p>
<p>I discovered these facts back in the summer. Dug out my receipt. I bought the laptop four years and four days ago. Damn!</p>
<p>At the time I was deep in working towards <a href="/blog/2021/09/17/dissertation-submitted/">my dissertation</a>, so I wasn&rsquo;t going to spend any more time on it. In September, though, I thought it would be worth contacting Apple support and seeing what could be done. I couldn&rsquo;t get a Genius Bar appointment, but I could take it to an Apple Authorised Service Provider called <a href="https://mrsystems.co.uk/pages/contact">MR in Shoreditch</a>. They had a look at it and said, yes it&rsquo;s the delamination thing, you&rsquo;re outside the free programme, we can fix it: 800 quid.</p>
<p>Too much. But! they also said that it would be worth taking it in to Apple. They might, depending on who you saw, do it for free anyway.</p>
<p>I was slightly sceptical, and we were getting ready for a trip to Scotland at the time, so I left it. Eventually, though, I booked it into the Genius Bar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re outside the programme, they said. But we&rsquo;ll fix it under consumer law. No charge.</p>
<p>The Sale of Goods Act (or its successors) for the win again: a laptop screen should last longer than four years.</p>
<p>During the tests they run, the guy noticed that the battery was poorly, and offered a replacement. £199 seems steep, so I said no thanks.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got an email to say it was ready to pick up, so I toddled off to Westfield. The staff member who brought it out to me asked me to wait while she checked something. Came back and said, &lsquo;You know how you rejected the battery replacement? Well it seems they did it anyway. We won&rsquo;t charge you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So that was weird. The work note that came with it said &lsquo;Battery won&rsquo;t charge at all,&rsquo; which was not true when I took it in. But here I am with a good-as-new battery. Well, <em>actually</em> new.</p>
<p>All of this required what they call a &lsquo;Top case replacement.&rsquo; &lsquo;Top case with battery,&rsquo; in fact, which suggests the battery is in the screen part of the laptop, not the keyboard part, which seems weird.</p>
<p>The big downside &ndash; but one that had been prepared for &ndash; is that I lost all my stickers. I had heard of this kind of thing happening, so I took photographs.</p>

			 <p><p><img src="uploads/2022/64e6031bb9.jpg" /></p> <p>This film is infuriating. It reminded me of <em>Shallow Grave</em>, at least at the start, in this way: if you find a load of money that's obviously come from a drug deal gone wrong, or otherwise somehow involved in organised crime, there is one thing you should <em>not</em> do. That is try it keep it all, to run away with it or hide it, and expect to survive the wrath of the criminals.</p><p>The safest thing, of course, is to just walk away from it all and call the cops. But if you must get into it, then obviously what you should do is take <em>some</em> of the money. Not a lot. Say, 10%. An amount that the gangsters might plausibly accept as having gone missing during the the shootout, or whatever. Leave the rest, call the cops, and let them handle the aftermath. You might get away with it.</p><p>Here, the main character does exactly the wrong thing. What's worse, in story terms, is that from the start we have no one to identify with: no character who is obviously the 'hero,' if you like. No one to root for. Because it all starts off without us having any particular reason to root for Llewelyn. And as it goes on, and we do start to want him to make it — if only because the focus is mainly on him — he continues to annoyingly make terrible choices.</p><p>Worse still -- and spoilers ahead -- worse still, his story is just dropped on the floor. He doesn't even get the respect of us seeing his end. The narrative hands over to a secondary character (though to be fair, that character, the sheriff, is the first character we meet, if only in voiceover).</p><p>And the end is just... nothing. </p><p>It is by far my least favourite Coen brothers film.</p></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Giving star ratings to things I’ve watched, read, etc, is not something I ever did until I started using <a href="https://letterboxd.com">Letterboxd</a>. It looks like I <a href="https://letterboxd.com/devilgate/films/diary/">started logging films in September 2019</a> (the August ones were a bulk mental dump when I first set up my account). I didn’t start them automatically posting here until <a href="/blog/letterboxd/8-women-2002-/">the November</a>, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve missed one or two along the way.</p>
<p>My initial thought was just to log the films that I watched, as an <em>aide memoire</em> as much as anything. But Letterboxd encourages you to give the films star ratings. I’ve been doing that, but all the time I wonder what exactly I mean by them.</p>
<p>Which sounds like a strange thing to say. I made the choices, after all: I set the rating. Surely I knew what I meant when I did it?</p>
<p>And that’s true enough on each occasion. I know what I mean when I give the rating. But that’s the thing: it’s what I meant <em>at that time</em>. All it means is what I thought of the the film at the time I added the entry to Letterboxd. I’m not trying to make a statement about what is <em>good</em> in absolute terms. I’m just saying something about what I thought about the film at that time.</p>
<p>I like to think that I judge each film on its own merits. At the very least, I try to judge it in terms of what it&rsquo;s trying to achieve. A five-star drama and a five-star comedy are very different things. It won’t be very meaningful to compare the ratings I’ve given to different films and see if there’s a hierarchy of my preferences. Though it is fair to say that any film with five stars is one of my favourites.</p>
<p>While Letterboxd encourages star ratings, it pleases me that you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to give one. Unlike, say in some online surveys, where zero is not an option. I don&rsquo;t know, though, whether a Letterboxd &lsquo;no stars&rsquo; should count as &lsquo;zero stars,&rsquo; or just the choice not to rate it. I intended the latter <a href="/blog/letterboxd/cant-get-you-out-of-my-head-2021/">with <cite>Can&rsquo;t Get You Out of my Head</cite></a>, as I made clear in the post.</p>
<p>It seems that I rarely watch anything less than three-star, though. Either I&rsquo;m very discerning, or I only watch things I know I&rsquo;m going to like.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m on a bit of a reread thing at the moment, partly because I moved some books around recently, which revealed some older ones.</p>
<p>This is another one that stands up really well. It has some amusing out-of-time moments, like &lsquo;three megabytes of hot RAM&rsquo;: imagine having that much computer memory! And the well-known geostationary satellite over Manhattan impossibility.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But we don&rsquo;t let those things bother us.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is just how much it influenced <cite>The Matrix</cite>. It was always fairly obvious that the Wachowskis named their virtual world after Gibson&rsquo;s cyberspace, though <a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/The_Matrix"><cite>Doctor Who</cite> got there first</a>, and possibly others did too. But there&rsquo;s a scene in <cite>Neuromancer</cite> where Case sees drifting lines of code overlaid on the reality that he&rsquo;s perceiving. Very much seems the inspiration for Neo seeing the Matrix.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s still a fine story, with some striking prose.</p>

			 <p>You wait years for a beloved three-letter-creator to return to a beloved SF show, and then two happen in one week. After <a href="/blog/2021/09/24/rustys-return/">the news</a> of RTD returning to <cite>Doctor Who</cite>, we have… <a href="http://www.jmsnews.com">JMS</a> returning to &ndash; and <a href="https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/1442621159221043202">rebooting &ndash; <cite>Babylon 5</cite></a>?</p>
<p>I did not see that coming. And I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how I feel about it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5"><cite>Babylon 5</cite></a>was among my favourite programmes of the nineties. It was groundbreaking, in that it was probably the first such show to be planned from the start as a single long (five year) story. With many sub-stories and side plots along the way, as you might imagine.</p>
<p>It was, of course, flawed, especially in the rushed completion of season 4. They thought they were going to be cancelled, so JMS tried to tie up most of the loose ends in that season. Then season 5 was saved, and ended up being slow and underpowered by comparison.</p>
<p>For this proposed reboot &ndash; it&rsquo;s TV, so nothing is definite till it&rsquo;s in the can &ndash; he says he will &lsquo;not be retelling the same story in the same way because of what Heraclitus said about the river&rsquo;, but that &lsquo;this is a reboot from the ground up rather than a continuation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If anyone else was running it, you could count me out. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski">Straczynski</a> <em>could</em> make it great again, but I sort of wonder why he wants to. Not unlike my wondering about why RTD wants to return to <cite>Who</cite>. I suppose we&rsquo;re never entirely satisfied with our creations, so getting the opportunity to go back and rework them can be tempting. But I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s always healthy.</p>
<p>Still, we live in hope.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanark:_A_Life_in_Four_Books">this</a> a long time ago, and the strange thing now is that everything I remembered of it happens in the first two books: that is, in Book 3 and Book 1. As I&rsquo;m sure you know, the internal books are ordered 3, 1, 2, 4.</p>
<p>Which sort of suggests that I didn&rsquo;t finish it all those years ago, but I&rsquo;m sure that isn&rsquo;t the case. There were odd moments of the slightest sense of the familiar in the other books, so I guess it&rsquo;s just vagaries.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was and remains a monumental work. It struck me as odd that the blurb describes it as &lsquo;a modern vision of hell.&rsquo; I had never thought of it in those terms. True, Lanark&rsquo;s situation is dark, difficult, and confusing, and he can be seen as Thaw after death, if Thaw dies at the end of Book 2, which seems likely. But hell? That seems extreme. Lanark has difficulties, but he&rsquo;s not in a state of eternal torment.</p>
<p>He is, however, quite a frustrating character. He is thrown into a situation &ndash; several situations &ndash; where he doesn&rsquo;t understand what is going on, or how the world works; and for the most part he doesn&rsquo;t ask even the most obvious questions, or make any attempt to gain understanding. So he&rsquo;s not so much protagonist as a character being pushed around by circumstance. Or by his author, whom we meet in the fourth-wall-destroying epilogue towards the end of the book.</p>
<p>Much more obviously, Lanark&rsquo;s experiences in Unthank and beyond are a satire of late-stage capitalism. Which you could say is a form of hell, so maybe that&rsquo;s what the blurb writer was getting at.</p>

			 <p><p><img src="uploads/2022/a3240836da.jpg" /></p> <p>This is a strange film. I knew the broad outline, or thought I did. An American gets brainwashed and ‘turned’ by the ‘other side’ during the Cold War, and then gets into the position of running for president. That’s not quite it, as it turns out, but it’s not far off. </p><p>The thing that surprised me, compared to how something like this would be done by a modern filmmaker, was how explicit the brainwashing was. Most modern writers and directors would, I think, be more indirect, so you’d be thinking, ‘Is he or isn’t he?’ throughout. Here it was very clear that he was, so the question was more, ‘What’s he going to do?’</p><p>Which is a perfectly fine way to tell the story, too. It was OK, through not as good as I expected, and there were some very odd pieces of dialogue (‘Are you Arabic?’) and a couple of strange jumps in the plot. </p><p>Worth a look, though, if you haven’t seen it.</p></p>

At least the bit I described as &lsquo;arguably more important&rsquo;. Russell T Davies is going to be the new showrunner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting decision, and one I have mixed feelings about. At his best he was great, and some of the things he&rsquo;s done since have been stellar. And I&rsquo;m astonished to find that I&rsquo;ve never mentioned either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_and_Years_(TV_series)"><cite>Years and Years</cite></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_and_Years_(TV_series)"><cite>It&rsquo;s a Sin</cite></a> here. Not least because I can remember recommending at least one of them online. Maybe it was just on Twitter, but I don&rsquo;t originate many tweets there. Nearly everything that isn&rsquo;t a reply comes from here.</p>
<p>Anyway, the great RTD is coming back, like <a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/The_456">the 456 in <cite>Torchwood</cite></a>. And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be great. I just think it&rsquo;s kind of sad if the BBC couldn&rsquo;t find someone new to take over. There must be plenty of people willing to take it on. Both willing and capable? That&rsquo;s another question. But hell, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski">JMS</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> offered. He&rsquo;s certainly capable, and it would have been amazing.</p>
<p>Also it&rsquo;s a shame that RTD won&rsquo;t get to work with Jodie Whittaker, because I think that could&rsquo;ve been quite a combo.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the reaction on much of <cite>Who</cite>-related Twitter, which seems to be, &lsquo;<cite>Doctor Who</cite> is saved!&rsquo; When it doesn&rsquo;t need saving due to having been really good for the last season and pretty good the season before that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be fun.</p>

			 <p>Dave Winer may be a very smart guy, who effectively invented blogging, RSS, and podcasts, but he&rsquo;s lost his mind in this post:</p>

<p>We are now all complete newbies when it comes to understanding how networks can be used to spread misinformation.

<p>The first sentence is fair enough, but the second? Facebook is the first line of <em>attack</em>, rather, on our democratic freedoms. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica">Cambridge Analytica</a> stories, <em>passim</em>. Or if not the <em>first</em>, then the most powerful tool in the armoury of the anti-democratic forces that plague us.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;them&rsquo; he refers to is, I think, journalists. Or &lsquo;journalism,&rsquo; as a collective entity:</p>
<blockquote>

			 <p>It was strangely timely that I decided to start reading this a few days before the 9/11 anniversary, since it concerns a man&rsquo;s obsession with what happened on 9/11. The narrator is a journalist who lost his partner in the attacks. Except her name doesn&rsquo;t appear on any passenger manifest, and there are multiple mysteries around the whole event.</p>
<p>As there are in real life. But this story takes place in a slightly altered reality. Scotland already has its independence, and England &ndash; or at least the little we see of London &ndash; has become increasingly dystopian, plagued by militarised police and surveillance.</p>
<p>The action switches back and forth in location between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Bute">the Isle of Bute</a> (where Priest also lives) and various parts of the USA (and sometimes those places are oddly coterminous). And also jumps around in time, from the present of the story &ndash; roughly 2017-8, when it was written and published &ndash; to before and during the 11th of September 2001, to various points between the two. It even dips a few years into the future.</p>
<p>It touches on ideas and discussions that are considered the domain of conspiracy theories, but largely avoids going down those rabbit holes. As <a href="https://omnibus.home.blog/2021/05/01/an-american-story-by-christopher-priest-review/">one review</a> I read said, &lsquo;Conspiracy theories purport answers, often paranoid and outlandish; <cite>An American Story</cite> is about <em>questions</em>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well worth a read, though there a couple of threads that he starts and leaves hanging, that I think would have been interesting to follow.</p>
<p>I usually forget to link to the books I write about. <a href="https://christopher-priest.co.uk/books/an-american-story">Here we are</a>.</p>

			 <p>My dissertation is due in just under a week. I&rsquo;m seeking an extension, because I&rsquo;ve been a bit poorly and have lost a lot of work time over the last week, but I still hope to get it in on time.</p>
<p>But that will mean my <a href="link://category/cwma">course</a> will be over. Which is a little bit saddening. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed being a student again, even though this academic year&rsquo;s particular situation has meant that the experience has been distinctly unlike a classic student one. Even, I&rsquo;m sure, for Birkbeck, &lsquo;London&rsquo;s evening university.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have, for example, met none of my classmates in person. I&rsquo;ve met exactly one member of staff, and that in the park in <a href="https://london.ac.uk/about-us/history-university-london/gordon-square">Gordon Square</a>. I&rsquo;ve never been in the department&rsquo;s building. I&rsquo;ve been into any Birkbeck building &ndash; the library &ndash; I think three times, maybe four.</p>
<p>Online classes have been fine, though. I wonder if creative writing, in its common workshopping format, works especially well over Teams or Zoom. Everyone takes turns to comment on the piece that&rsquo;s being discussed, and there&rsquo;s much less scope for interruptions, compared to in person. Of course the downside of that is that there&rsquo;s less scope for conversation, for organic discussion. So we probably lost out in some ways, too.</p>
<p>Less, though, than students on other courses, and especially first year undergraduates. Like my daughter, who has done a year of uni and met practically no one on her course. It&rsquo;s a strange state of affairs, to be sure.</p>
<p>But we move on. This novel extract isn&rsquo;t going to dissert itself.</p>

			 <p>The absence of an apostrophe in the title has disturbed me slightly since I heard of this book. I think I concluded that it was meant as a verbal statement: rainbows <em>do</em> end, after all. The fact that the last chapter is entitled, &lsquo;The Missing Apostrophe&rsquo; comforts me.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/tag/vernor-vinge/">The other Vinge books that I&rsquo;ve read</a> (which would appear from that to only be one, but that is misleading) are galaxy-spanning space operas. This, in contrast, is very compact in scale, being set almost entirely in San Diego, and on the net. It&rsquo;s a near-future thriller about medical and technological advances and how things might be for someone who was nearly dead from Alzheimer&rsquo;s and then was brought back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good, but 2025, the year in which it is set, feels pretty close now. I guess it didn&rsquo;t in 2006.</p>

			 <p>I actually read this before the <a href="/blog/2021/08/21/whit-by-iain-banks-books-2021-15/">previous one</a>, but forget to write about it. Perhaps that&rsquo;s because I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it very much.</p>
<p>Jack Vance is considered one of the greats of SF, and I realised recently that I hadn&rsquo;t read anything by him. And I had this big volume that Gollancz gave away at a convention some time, containing this and two other books (another novel and a collection of short stories). A sort of literary compilation album.</p>
<p>But not a Greatest Hits — or if it is, then things are pretty bad.</p>
<p>The main problem is that it&rsquo;s dated. Usually we can work around that sort of thing, and I did — look at me, all finished with it — but the main thing here is that it&rsquo;s just badly written. Cardboard characters, dodgy sexual politics, and a plot that, while interesting enough to get me through it, is far too easily resolved.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the background of an Earth empire or federation or similar, that we see essentially notthing of. Instead the action is all confined to the eponymous planet. It &lsquo;revolutionised the <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/planetary_romance">planetary romance</a>,&rsquo; according to the blurb. And, indeed it was important to the form according to the linked SF Encyclopedia entry.</p>
<p>So much for that. All I can say is, it didn&rsquo;t do a lot for me.</p>

			 <p>The human memory is an amazing thing. In this case, it&rsquo;s amazing what it&rsquo;s possible <em>not</em> to remember.</p>
<p>To wit: I remembered almost completely nothing about this book. That the main character was part of an odd religious community based near Stirling in Scotland; and that she had to make a trip to London by slightly unusual means to track down a musical and possibly apostate cousin: that&rsquo;s as far as my memory went.</p>
<p>It came out in 1995, so twenty-six years have passed since I first read it. I would have said that I had reread it once, which you would hope might lock things down a bit in the brain. But on the plus side, it meant it was almost like reading a new Iain Banks book, so in that way the forgetting was good.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;d expect, a great deal more happens than what I remembered. It&rsquo;s another family drama, in the vein of <cite>The Crow Road</cite><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and <a href="/blog/2007/09/20/the-steep-approach-to-garbadale-by-iain-banks-books-2007-4/"><cite>The Steep Approach to Garbadale</cite></a>.

			 <p>I realised the other day that it&rsquo;s a year ago that I was applying for creative writing MAs, before <a href="/blog/2020/09/16/how-im-going-to-master-this-writing-lark/">being accepted on and choosing the one at Birkbeck</a>.</p>
<p>Well that went fast.</p>
<p>2021 feels like it&rsquo;s being disappearing even faster than 2020 did, which is strange. Or maybe not. The pandemic is far from  over, of course, many things are still up in the air, and it could all change again in an instant.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been lax in reporting on what&rsquo;s been going on with <a href="/categories/cwma/">the course</a> . The summer term was all an optional lecture series, which largely consisted of members of staff interviewing writers, along with one or two pieces about the craft of writing. One on the structure of the novel, and one a session with some agents.</p>
<p>That last one probably had the most practical value &ndash; at least potentially &ndash; but they were all interesting.</p>
<p>Other than that, My dissertation is due in a month. Actually now just under four weeks. It consists of 15,000 words of creative writing (plus or minus 10%, so up to 16,500), plus a 3000-word preface (also plus or minus 10%). I have 23,000 words, of which I can&rsquo;t use the first five or six thousand, because I already submitted them for an earlier assessment. So there&rsquo;s plenty to work with.</p>
<p>It feels a little odd to have paused the forward flow &ndash; I intend this to be a novel, after all &ndash; to work on editing what I have so far. But it ought to be worthwhile for the novel, as well as being necessary for my dissertation. This period of working over what I&rsquo;ve already done should give me a firmer base on which to build the rest.</p>
<p>I think I miss classes. I only had two a week for the first two terms, and a slightly more erratic schedule averaging to one a week for the third, but they provided structure, as well as a feeling of connection with others on the course. So I&rsquo;m looking forward to an informal workshop session some of us have arranged for this week.</p>
<p>But beyond that, the future. What&rsquo;s next?</p>

			 <p>Another one suggested by <a href="link://category/cwma">my supervisor</a>. It&rsquo;s about a band, and the novel I&rsquo;m working on involves a couple of bands. And it&rsquo;s also a multiple viewpoint third-person narrative, as is mine.</p>
<p>Like <a href="/blog/2021/07/08/summerwater-by-sarah-moss-books-2021-11/">the last such</a>, it handles the multiple viewpoints in quite an extreme way. There are four band members, and a quarter of the book is told from the point of view of each. Four chapters, no returning once one PoV is finished with.</p>
<p>The title is the name of the band, and their schtick is that they are all exes of someone else in the band (in practice, it&rsquo;s two former couples, but there&rsquo;s obviously a certain amount of will they/won&rsquo;t they about any other possible hookings up).</p>
<p>So really it&rsquo;s about the relationships, and how each person handles the pressure-cooker of being in a band together, touring, all that. Along with a fair chunk of backstory for each.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s set in Boston (and a few other places) in the early to mid nineties. The ending is &ndash; open, let&rsquo;s say, but not in annoying way. In fact, it&rsquo;s quite satisfying, though I could happily have read more.</p>

			 <p>Sorry, that&rsquo;s, like, the most obvious title in known space. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57940451">Jodie and Chris are leaving <cite>Doctor Who</cite></a> after the next series and specials. Late 2022, that is.</p>
<p>That BBC News report is almost comically self-flagellatory. After quoting Jodie Whittaker&rsquo;s hugely positive statements about the show, they say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While many have praised Whittaker&rsquo;s casting, some fans and critics have criticised the show&rsquo;s recent narrative direction.</p>
<p>The Telegraph described recent episodes as &ldquo;flat, worthy and woke&rdquo; despite Whittaker&rsquo;s talent as an actress, while The Sun reported viewers were left furious by the show&rsquo;s &ldquo;unbearable political correctness&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ndash; Uncredited BBC reporter, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57940451">Doctor Who: Jodie Whittaker and Chris Chibnall to leave in 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If <em>those</em> publications are making <em>those</em> criticisms, I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s a big win. Stop beating yourself up, the BBC. The programme is and remains a success, the jewel in the BBC&rsquo;s crown.</p>
<p>Significantly further down the report they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Episodes such as Rosa, Demons of the Punjab and Spyfall thrilled audiences, and netted the show two Bafta Must See Moment nominations, along with multiple National Television Award, Bafta Cymru, TV Choice and Critics Choice nominations.</p>
<p>In 2020, Whittaker was voted second most popular Doctor of all-time in a poll of 50,000 fans for the Radio Times, losing out to David Tennant.</p>
<p>&ndash; As before, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57940451">Doctor Who: Jodie Whittaker and Chris Chibnall to leave in 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you go. Now: who&rsquo;s going to the the next Doctor? And &ndash; arguably more importantly &ndash; who&rsquo;s going to be the next head writer?</p>
<p>Or will they just put the show on ice for a few years? I read a piece recently that suggested that&rsquo;s what it needs to revitalise itself, citing the gap from 1989 to 2005 as the model.</p>
<p>I hope they don&rsquo;t do that. In fact, if it needs revitalisation at all, then last season&rsquo;s big revelations about the Doctor&rsquo;s origins are just what they need for that. You could, for example, have a season or two of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Martin">Jo Martin&rsquo;s</a> Doctor. She&rsquo;d be great, though such a move would confuse people, since it would be in the past of the Doctor we know.</p>
<p>We can only look forward to finding out.</p>

It&rsquo;s about gardening, and it contains the wonderful line (of the insects in question), &lsquo;They are nothing but good and fair, a sufficient reason for summer to exist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I was in the sitting room with the window open the other day, and one flew in. I&rsquo;ve only seen them very occasionally in the wild, skimming along above a river or pond. I&rsquo;ve always found them slightly disturbing, because they&rsquo;re so big for an insect. It&rsquo;s an echo of the utter revulsion I remember feeling in a biology lab back in my schooldays, where there were stick insects. Some people were happy to take them out and hold them, but I could barely stay in the room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s borderline phobic, I realise: stick insects don&rsquo;t even <em>do</em> anything, they just sit there being camouflaged and inoffensive. But there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about that kind of gut reaction.</p>
<p>Except maybe allow time to pass. Back in the sitting room with the visiting dragonfly, I was surprised, but felt more fascination than revulsion. I closed the door so it wouldn&rsquo;t go further into the house, opened the window wide, and waited to see if it would go out. There wasn&rsquo;t much else I could do: even if it settled, it was much too big to catch under a glass to release outside, as I would a spider.</p>
<p>The pattern of its flight was strange and erratic-seeming. Very different from the flies, wasps, and moths that much more commonly come into houses. Something to do with those double wings and that long tail, maybe. It pootled around, approached the window a couple of times, without going for the open part, but didn&rsquo;t bang itself against the glass as the smaller visitors do.</p>
<p>Once it rested up on the plaster moulding near the ceiling.</p>
<p>Eventually it flew towards the window again, found the opening, and was gone. It&rsquo;s a short walk, and a shorter flight, down to the River Lea, its likely habitat round these parts. But I wonder what brought it all the way up here.</p>
<p>And now looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly">the Wikipedia article</a>, I wonder if it was actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damselfly">damselfly</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dragonflies can be mistaken for the related group, damselflies (Zygoptera), which are similar in structure, though usually lighter in build; however, the wings of most dragonflies are held flat and away from the body, while damselflies hold their wings folded at rest, along or above the abdomen. Dragonflies are agile fliers, while damselflies have a weaker, fluttery flight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how it held its wings when it rested, but that &lsquo;weaker, fluttery flight&rsquo; does sound more like my interesting summer visitor.</p>

			 <p>Just last month I wrote <a href="/blog/2021/06/08/single-points/">Single Points</a>, about the Fastly CDN outage. This morning many, many sites were down or inaccessible because of an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/07/22/internet-outage-amazon-airbnb-delta/">outage at Akamai</a>. A content delivery network again, though they&rsquo;re saying the outage is caused by &lsquo;edge DNS.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m familiar with DNS, but not the &lsquo;edge&rsquo; variant. In fact, I realise it&rsquo;s capitalised and is the name of an Akamai product or service.</p>
<p>More evidence that the increasing centralisation of internet services is a problem. On the plus side, it was resolved quickly. When a service provider has the kind of major clients we&rsquo;re talking about here, then that company is going to have to be able to respond quickly and get things back up. If a random small or midlevel company ran all its own server hardware and software, an outage would only inconvenience that company&rsquo;s customers. But the company would need to have the staff available to sort the problems out. That would be a large and arguably unnecessary overhead.</p>
<p>So I understand the desire to offload responsibilities to a service provider, and the economies of scale that a company specialising in running network services can bring. But I fear it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before one of these events results in serious damage or even loss of life.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m claiming to know what the answer is.</p>

<p>The whole thing takes place over two or three days, and each chapter is a single paragraph. The latter is kind of annoying, because it makes it hard to find a good place to stop reading. Also all the dialogue is integrated into the paragraphs without speech marks. This kind of different way of representing dialogue is becoming increasingly common, it seems to me.</p>
<p>The story&rsquo;s good, though I found the ending a little weak. And slightly reminiscent of the <a href="/blog/2013/09/21/the-summer-of-rereading-1-the-magus-by-john-fowles/">ending of <cite>The Magus</cite></a>, strangely. That same sense of slightly-incomplete explanation.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The author is one of my <a href="link://category/cwma">MA</a> supervisors, so take that under advisement, I guess.</p>
<p>This is a historical novel, based on the real life of Charles Howard Hinton, a Victorian mathematician who studied the idea of a fourth spatial dimension. In fact, at least from this I&rsquo;d go further: he <em>believed in the existence</em> of such a dimension. He, I learned, was the originator of the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract">tesseract</a>, which &ndash; as I&rsquo;m sure you know &ndash; is the four-dimensional equivalent of a cube.</p>
<p>So much for that. What of the story? It&rsquo;s interesting, a little odd, and slightly experimental, in terms of its telling. It makes use of letters, diagrams, and other documents from Hinton&rsquo;s life. But a lot of the really interesting bits of Hinton&rsquo;s life &ndash; his bigamous marriage and being convicted for the same, and subsequent departure for, and time in, Japan, for example &ndash; are told largely offscreen. Or second-hand and partially, via some of those letters.</p>
<p>Which is all fair enough, but I feel that we didn&rsquo;t really get to know Hinton as a person. I could have done with more of that. In fact we get to know some other members of his family slightly better, as the story&rsquo;s focus changes in the second half.</p>
<p>The book is split into sections called &lsquo;Point,&rsquo; &lsquo;Line,&rsquo; &lsquo;Square,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cube,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tesseract,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cube,&rsquo; &lsquo;Square,&rsquo; &lsquo;Line,&rsquo; &lsquo;Point.&rsquo; Numbered chapters or subsections, 1 to 14, are included across the first &lsquo;Line&rsquo; and &lsquo;Square.&rsquo; But chapter 9 is missing, or skipped. I kept trying to find some mathematical reason for this &ndash; 9 is a square number, of course, but it&rsquo;s not the only square number in the list, and there&rsquo;s nothing special about 9 in the text, that I noticed. Nor is it one of the numbers we associate with a cube. Six faces, eight vertices, but not nine of anything. So I suspect it&rsquo;s actually a mistake. I might email Mark and ask him.</p>
<p>I first came to know of Hinton through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Rucker">Rudy Rucker&rsquo;s</a> books. The fourth dimension is one of Rucker&rsquo;s great interests, along with infinities, so Hinton was bound to come up. Apparently I&rsquo;ve never mentioned Rucker on my site before. That&rsquo;s a little surprising, but I suppose it&rsquo;s a good few years since I read anything by him. I&rsquo;m slightly surprised to find he&rsquo;s still alive: I thought I remembered hearing of his death (and was surprised I hadn&rsquo;t noted <em>that</em> here). Oh well, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Mandela_effect">Mandela effect</a>, I suppose.</p>
<p>Lastly, I noticed it was on the <a href="https://clarkeaward.medium.com/?p=d699487c087b">list of eligible titles for this year&rsquo;s Clarke Award</a> (and my apologies for linking to Medium). Which is odd, as it&rsquo;s not really a novel of the fantastic in any way (except maybe, the slightest hint of something towards the end). But it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first novel the the Clarke Award has noticed for which that is true. And Hinton wrote some SF himself, and inspired various SF writers as well as Rucker, so it kind of sits near the genre.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming. When <a href="/blog/2020/04/09/website-changes/">I moved my website</a> to <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> last year, I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the comments on the blog will disappear. They’re not lost, and I plan to get them back, but I need to find the best way to do that. For now, comment via Twitter or Micro.blog.</p>
<p>&ndash; Me, <a href="/blog/2020/04/09/website-changes/">Last year</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting them back, and setting up another system for comments, has taken me till now. I&rsquo;ve had <a href="link:/blog/tag/covid-19/">other</a> things <a href="link:/categories/cwma/">on my mind</a>.</p>
<p>That post was in April 2020. In May I wrote about various commenting systems I had experimented with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Disqus is known to track its users and show ads, and I don’t want that for anyone who might comment here.
…
So far I’ve tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://posativ.org/isso/">Isso</a>: you have to run a service on your site. I couldn’t get the service to respond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://staticman.net/">Staticman</a>: I couldn’t get its service to start. A problem with configuring the private key setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.remarkbox.com/">Remarkbox</a>: at the time of writing this is still active, but I’m not sure I’ll keep it. It works like Disqus, in that the comments are hosted on a third-party site, which is not really in keeping with the whole static site/indieweb ethos. It’s not advertising driven like Disqus, but it behaves a bit strangely, at least on here. We’ll see, though.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash; Also me, <a href="/blog/2020/05/01/static-leads-to-static/">Not quite so long ago</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remarkbox was active for a while. It worked, but it was just too <em>weird</em> in the way it handled users. I also tried Intense Debate, which is made by Automattic, the WordPress people, and is hosted on their servers. It worked, but I could only post comments using Chrome, for some reason. I&rsquo;m a Safari user, and even if I weren&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s a no-no.</p>
<p>So for a while I didn&rsquo;t have comments at all. I wonder if anyone noticed.</p>
<p>But recently I tried Isso again, and something clicked this time. It worked more or less without me having to do anything &ndash; at least, that is, when I ran it from the command line on my server. When I ran it as a service &ndash; that is, automatically, in the background, the way something like that needs to run &ndash; it just didn&rsquo;t work. A bit of Ducking led me <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/installing-isso-on-debian-apache.html">to this post</a>, which, despite being partly about Apache, when I use Nginx, gave me the pointers I needed to get it all working.</p>
<p>Isso keeps the comments on my server, rather than being an external service, so it&rsquo;s much more in keeping with the principle of owning my own content. And I&rsquo;ve imported the old comments from the WordPress site. I got some error messages when I ran the import, so I don&rsquo;t know if they all made it over, but at least <em>some</em> of them are here.</p>
<p>I need to work on the styling a bit, I think, but other than that it&rsquo;s all good to go.</p>

			 <p>Just over a year ago <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/06/16/you-are-your-thoughts-i-think/">I was posting, in passing</a>, about &lsquo;the quiet of early lockdown.&rsquo; Actually that particular phrase was a quote, but I was definitely aware of how quiet things were outside.</p>
<p>Including &ndash; particularly, in fact &ndash; in our back gardern. We live in a terrace, which means there are other people&rsquo;s back gardens in all directions around us, and quite close. A year ago it was quiet, not just from the lack of cars in the distance, of planes overhead, but also because no one much was in their gardens.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s a cacophony: music playing, dishes clattering, children shouting… I guess it&rsquo;s part of our return to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; &ndash; or toward &lsquo;normal,&rsquo; at least. But it&rsquo;s strange. It suggests that, last year in spring and early summer, people were scared to go out, not just into the streets, into shops, but into their own gardens.</p>
<p>No one caught Covid over a garden fence. Or so I imagine. At the same time, it didn&rsquo;t hurt to be cautious.</p>

			 <p>They say the vaccines give maximum resistance &lsquo;two to three weeks&rsquo; after the second dose. I <a href="/2021/06/03/vax.html">hit the two-week mark</a> yesterday, and now consider myself &lsquo;maxinated,&rsquo; more or less.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going swimming later today. It has been approximately fifteen and a half months since I last swam. Back in February  2020 and the preceding months, I was going two or three times a week, most weeks. So I&rsquo;ve missed it.</p>
<p>I had hoped to go to London Fields Lido: start outdoors, to keep things maximally safe. But it&rsquo;s all booked up till Monday, so I&rsquo;m going to the much closer, but less busy, King&rsquo;s Hall, my local pool.</p>
<p>Both, predictably, require bookings, so there&rsquo;s little chance of them being crowded.</p>
<p>In other covidian matters, remember back in March last year, when I <a href="/2020/03/27/this-video-on.html">shared a video of someone showing how to clean your shopping</a>? And then I quickly <a href="/2020/03/27/i-wish-i.html">walked it back</a>, on <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1243319180851580929.html">better advice</a>? Well, at that point we were already wiping down all items arriving in the house, much as the guy in the video was doing. And we continued to do it. I&rsquo;ve used more antiseptic wipes this last year than I&rsquo;ve owned in any previous year.</p>
<p>Yes, we soon learned that Covid was almost entirely transferred by air, and hardly by surfaces at all (though we also learned the word &lsquo;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fomite">fomite</a>'). But the idea that anything crossing the threshold was a potential infection vector burned deep, and remained.</p>
<p>Now, post vaccination, post maxination, will we keep on doing that? Probably not. It&rsquo;d be nice to get the time back when bringing the shopping home or receiving a delivery. But I don&rsquo;t know, it could take a while to stop feeling suspicious of things that have come in from out there.</p>
<p>Covid has made germophobes of us all.</p>

			 <p>I noticed that GitHub was down this morning &ndash; or not down, exactly, but its web pages were profoundly broken. I tried different browsers, then jumped on Twitter to see if it was widely reported.</p>
<p>It was. People were saying the problem was Fastly, a content delivery network (CDN). Also that it was affecting other sites. I don&rsquo;t know when CDNs started being a thing. I think they might have been recommended by some when I was still using WordPress. The idea being that a CDN can host your site&rsquo;s static assets &ndash; images, mainly &ndash; while WordPress carries on with the dynamic bits, generating HTML pages on the fly, as it does. The CDN&rsquo;s scale will mean it can serve those files faster than your little server.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t bother with them, not having that much traffic. But in the back of my mind there was always the thought, &lsquo;What if the CDN goes down?&rsquo; The idea, of course, was that the CDN would be big, multiply-redundant, reliable: it&rsquo;s not going to go down!</p>
<p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/08/tech/internet-outage-fastly/index.html">Here&rsquo;s a CNN report about the outage</a>. It affected a <em>lot</em> more than GitHub, it seems.</p>
<p>So, are CDNs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure">single points of failure</a>? Obviously there&rsquo;s more than one CDN, but if the failure of any one can disable large chunks of the web, do they put us in a better position?</p>

			 <p>News comes out that <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/06/02/prosus-acquires-stack-overflow/">Stack Overflow is being bought</a> by something called <a href="https://www.prosus.com/">Prosus</a>. I&rsquo;ve never heard of them, but they&rsquo;re &lsquo;a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors in the world,&rsquo; to quote their own site.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t bode well. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> is without doubt the most <em>useful</em> site in the world, at least as far as programming and other technical matters goes. And its sub-sites cover a vast range of interests beyond the technical: use of English for both <a href="https://ell.stackexchange.com">beginners</a> and <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com">experienced people</a>, for example; or <a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com">science fiction</a>; parenting, martial arts, the great outdoors, and <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites">a hundred more</a>.</p>
<p>When a big company buys up a small one, it rarely ends well for the users of the small company&rsquo;s products or services, or so it seems to me. Yahoo bought Flickr and let it largely wither on the vine.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Similarly with Del.icio.us. Google has bought numerous properties and either rolled them into its own products, or abandoned them.</p>
<p>In this case the purchaser is not a technology company itself, but just a holding company. Those ones tend to result in the bought company coming under pressure to make more money. The buyer wants to recover its investment. That tends to end up with the the bought company either selling intrusive advertising space, or selling its customers' data.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to go that way. Maybe this Prosus will be different. But I can&rsquo;t help thinking it&rsquo;s a sad day for mutual help on the web.</p>

<p>Convention dictates that I should give a star rating to this. I’m not going to, though, because I’m not sure what it was trying to achieve. What I try to do with star ratings is judge how well, in my opinion, the film achieves what it was trying to do. I don’t claim I always manage that, but when it’s not clear what the film’s purpose was, it becomes next to impossible.</p>
<p>Or: you can’t reduce something as long and complex, audacious and challenging as this, to a mere zero-to-ten scale.
<sup id="fnref:boxstars">
	<a href="#fn:boxstars" rel="footnote">1</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Across six films, totalling around seven hours, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis" rel="nofollow">Adam Curtis</a> gives us ‘An Emotional History of the Modern World,’ as the subtitle calls it. As I mentioned in my <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2021/05/26/the-illuminatus-trilogy-by-robert-shea-and-robert-anton-wilson-books-2021-8/" rel="nofollow">last post</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Wendell_Thornley" rel="nofollow">Kerry Thornley</a> of Discordian fame is interviewed early in it. That is, an interview with him is used. He’s dead, so it’s not like he was interviewed for these films. Indeed, as far as I can tell, nothing was shot for these films: the visuals are entirely comprised of library footage.</p>
<p>Curtis narrates over them — sometimes with quite a disconnected effect, where the images have no obvious connection to the story he’s telling. Similarly, the use of music can be quite jarring. Sometimes it’s completely relevant to the matter at hand, but often there’s no obvious connection. And the titular Kylie song is not used at all.</p>
<p>It’s not even that obvious why the series is called that, come to think of it. And some of the individual episode titles are even more opaque, notably the last one: ‘Are We Pigeon or are We Dancer?’ I feel sure it’s a quote, and I think it’s probably from a song, but I was alert to it turning up, and as far as I could tell, it didn’t.</p>
<p>OK, a quick <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%27Are+We+Pigeon+or+are+We+Dancer%3F%27" rel="nofollow"> DuckDuck </a> gives mainly hits about the episode, but also some about <a href="https://www.gigwise.com/news/47201/" rel="nofollow">a track by The Killers</a> called ‘Human,’ which includes the line ‘are we human or are we dancer?’ So it’s probably alluding to that. Oddly that line is inspired by a Hunter S Thompson quote that I’m not familiar with, ‘We’re raising a generation of dancers.’ Which sounds pretty good to me, even if Hunter meant it critically.</p>
<p>Anyway, what’s this absurdly long film <em>about</em>?</p>
<p>It’s a bleak, depressing, but nonetheless compelling vision of human history, covering conspiracies and conspiracy theories, wars, revolution, surveillance capitalism, and capitalism more broadly, the tension between the collective and the individual, and a whole hell of a lot more.</p>
<p>But Curtis never gives a thesis statement. He never tells us, in the news journalist’s way, what he’s going to tell us. Or more to the point, what conclusions he’s going to draw from what he’s going to tell us. And his style is very disjointed: he dots about in time and space, with little more to connect the dots than a ‘but’: ‘But in China…’</p>
<p>In that particular tic, it’s not at all unlike the postmodern games of <cite>Illuminatus!</cite>.</p>
<p>He does come to kind of a conclusion at the end of the two-hour-long sixth episode, but it’s not a very satisfying or convincing one. Which is fair enough, I suppose. One of the recurring thoughts is the idea that society today is too complex for anyone to understand it fully. The problem with that, that he draws our attention to, is that that understanding has caused many politicians to give up trying to change things for the better, which tends to result in burgeoning corruption.</p>
<p>He does end with a note of possible hope, but I think I might have to watch parts of it again to get all of the nuances.</p>

<p>&hellip; Smith was an unexplored writer of strange fiction. Duff sums up the narrative of the film: “Essentially, the Fall are trying to record an EP at a studio on Pendle Hill, while the surrounding countryside is at the mercy of a satanic biker gang and a squad of Jacobites who have slipped through a wormhole in time.”</p>

			 <p>The mysterious long-time blogger known only as &lsquo;But She&rsquo;s A Girl&rsquo; has some wise thoughts on how her creative process is affected by deadlines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I need to remember is that it is always like this. Deadlines are a fact of life and I just have to deal with them when they come up, but the pressure they impose is temporarily disastrous for my creativity. This means that I need to have solved any problems relating to the task which require creative thought long before the suffocating fog of the deadline descends. It’s also why I sometimes go quiet on this blog for weeks at a time. It’s not that I don’t have time to write here, but more that I don’t have the mental space to play around with ideas.</p>

			 <p>David Mitchell (the novelist, not the comedian) on Italo Calvino&rsquo;s <cite>If On A Winter&rsquo;s Night A Traveller</cite>, which is a book I love:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood why writers who write on writing get charged with creative onanism when artists are allowed to paint themselves until the Rembrandts come home or a work like Young Person&rsquo;s Guide to the Orchestra - music about music, right? - is fine with everyone</p>
<p>&ndash; David Mitchell, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/22/fiction.italocalvino">Enter the maze</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fair point. There&rsquo;s nothing <em>wrong</em> with a writer writing about a writer. I think the practice gets criticised because it became so common in literary fiction as to be a cliche.</p>
<p>The article also contains the revelation that <cite>Cloud Atlas</cite> was at least partly inspired by Calvino&rsquo;s novel.</p>

			 <p>I know, JK Rowling is a somewhat troubling figure now. When this book came out, last year, my daughter was adamant that we not buy it, because of Rowling&rsquo;s anti-trans statements, and I had respected her feelings up till now; as well as having my own concerns. But&hellip; the art, not the artist, I guess? Even if I&rsquo;m further enriching her by buying the art?</p>
<p>The truth is twofold: one, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s actively antithetical to trans people. She has a complex, nuanced position about various aspects of the situation, which gets blown out of all proportion on Twitter, when nuance, as it does, heads over there to die. And which, surprisingly and disappointingly for a wordsmith, she doesn&rsquo;t seem able to elucidate that well.</p>
<p>And two, I really like the books and wanted to read it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I <a href="/blog/2021/05/14/pastieland-and-getting-sick/">was sick</a>, and I had decided that I was going to treat the time on the sofa as an extension of the holiday, and not try to get back to working on the novel/dissertation till the Monday. I wanted some comfort reading, and this was what I wanted. I knew I&rsquo;d rip through it in a few days, <em>even if I was trying to work at the time</em>. So I killed two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, as ever. I don&rsquo;t really understand how she makes the pages turn so fast (there are a lot of them, especially as an ebook). I did pick up a couple of typos, and some odd line break errors, which might be to do with the translation to ebook &ndash; either way, it&rsquo;s very sloppy editing/proofreading by the publishers. Also some &ndash; several &ndash; places where I would have edited a line to make it better. I noticed fewer of those as the plot roared on, unsurprisingly. Which at least means I&rsquo;m reading even a book like this in a more writerly fashion. Or I was at the start.</p>
<p>The main other weaknesses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything comes together just a bit <em>too</em> tidily.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s too much about some of the secondary cases the agency is working on, over and above the main one. Those can be interesting or amusing, and sure, it&rsquo;s realistic that they&rsquo;d have to have more than just a forty-year-old cold case to work on, over a year. But in the end they feel like padding.</li>
<li>As the denouement unfolds she uses a gimmick where the characters learn or work out something, which they relate to each other, but which is not revealed to us. It&rsquo;s kind of annoying, because it&rsquo;s suddenly hiding info from the reader that the characters have, where earlier in the story that wasn&rsquo;t happening. I think she&rsquo;s done it before in some (maybe all) of the Strike novels.</li>
</ul>
<p>But a lot of fun, anyway.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve not posted here for a while. We managed a week-long trip to Cornwall &ndash; yes! Leaving home, leaving the city, staying in a rented house. It&rsquo;s almost like things are getting back to normal.</p>
<p>Though not quite. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevagissey">Mevagissey</a> is a great wee town, but it&rsquo;s far from fully open yet. Almost none of the restaurants have any outside space, what with it been squeezed in between the bottom of a steep hill and the sea, so they haven&rsquo;t reopened yet. The takeaways were open, but it&rsquo;s a sleepy place, and most things close early.</p>
<p>We stayed in Tregoney House, on the hill of the same name, which I mention here as much for my own records as anything else. Nice house, though.</p>
<p>We got to see family and eat pasties, fudge, and fish &amp; chips. And visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Gardens_of_Heligan">Lost Gardens of Heligan</a>. It was all quite exciting, really.</p>
<p>Then the day after we got home, I got sick. Not Covid, I&rsquo;m pleased to say, but it knocked me out for about four or five days. No writing, just some reading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all better now, though, and starting to buckle down for my dissertation. It&rsquo;s due in four months time, which suddenly seems perilously short.</p>

			 <p>This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/27/senior-tories-urge-boris-johnson-to-come-clean-on-funding-of-no-10-refurb">story about Boris Johnson redecorating in Downing Street</a> is too stupid not to be a deliberate distraction. 10 Downing Street, along with 11 and others, are government buildings. Their maintenance should be paid for with government money. And since they are also places where people live, it&rsquo;s not unreasonable that there should be money available for redecoration when the resident changes.</p>
<p>And I guess it&rsquo;s <em>also</em> fair that the new resident can pay extra for the work, out of their own money, if they choose to do so. Any money coming from other sources would have to be declared in the <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/">Register of Members' Financial Interests</a>.</p>
<p>This is all normal. If Johnson has failed to declare contributions from his party or donors, that&rsquo;s the offence. It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>So the fact that it&rsquo;s filling the headlines with leaks and all, suggests it&rsquo;s a smokescreen for something else.</p>
<p>But what?</p>

			 <p>I just got an invite/reminder email about a service called <a href="https://www.onmail.com">OnMail</a>. I must have signed up to be notified when it became available. Could have been months ago: they apologise for it taking so long.</p>
<p>They should apologise for being bad for the email infrastructure that binds the world together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exaggerating, but only a bit. Email remains the most important thing on the internet aside from the web. Whenever you sign up for a service, or order something online, you expect to get an email confirmation.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Without reliable email, a lot of things would fall apart.</p>
<p>A while back <a href="/blog/2020/07/16/hey-ho-lets-not-go/">I wrote about Hey</a>, the new email service from <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. There, I was bothered by it not being based on the standard, open protocols that underlie email, at least to the extent that you can&rsquo;t get your Hey email using a third-party, standard client.</p>
<p>OnMail seems both visually and functionally similar to Hey, and it&rsquo;s got exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>This trend is bad for email, bad for people who use email. It should be possible to give us the kind of powerful, automated controls over our inboxes that these services offer, <em>without</em> stopping us from using the apps we prefer. It <em>is</em> possible to do that, as companies like <a href="https://www.sanebox.com">SaneBox</a> show.</p>
<p>I do not like this trend.</p>

			 <p>When I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/letterboxd/when-harry-met-sally-1989-/">wrote about watching <cite>When Harry Met Sally…</cite> last year</a>, I said that &lsquo;Nora Ephron may be my favourite screenwriter after Aaron Sorkin, where dialogue is concerned.&rsquo; The dialogue in this novel isn&rsquo;t so sparkling, but the narration is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fictionalisation of the breakdown of her marriage to the journalist Carl Bernstein, and it&rsquo;s amazing how funny she makes it, considering how painful the experience clearly was.</p>
<p>Seems to be her only novel, which is kind of a shame.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that the woman Bernstein had an affair with is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Jay,_Baroness_Jay_of_Paddington">daughter of prime minister Jim Callaghan</a>.</p>
<p>Far more interestingly, though, is that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_Ephron#Personal_life">according to Wikipedia</a>, Ephron was one of the few people who knew the identity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Throat_(Watergate)">Deep Throat</a>.</p>
<p>None of which has anything to do with the book, which you should just read.</p>

<div>To make up for just how monumentally dystopian <cite>84K</cite> is, <cite>Notes from the Burning Age</cite> is a look at the distant future of the earth… in which we’ve got it right. We sorted our shit out, we built an environmentalist utopia of clean energy, social justice, respect for all and so on.

			 <p>Sometimes you don&rsquo;t even realise what you&rsquo;ve been missing. Or how much you&rsquo;ve been missing it.

<p>They&rsquo;ve stayed in business through this mad year, and I&rsquo;ve ordered several books from them in that time. If a book&rsquo;s not in stock they can usually get it in in a couple of days. I just had to walk up the road and collect them at the door.</p>
<p>No going in, though. Apart from collecting an order, all I could do was look in the window.</p>
<p>So it was fantastic to be able to go into the shop and <em>browse</em>. I&rsquo;d almost forgotten what that&rsquo;s like.</p>

			 <p>Despite the title, this is not a writing &lsquo;how-to&rsquo; book, except maybe by example. Nor is it a novel itself; it is a collection of essays. The subjects they cover do include writing and writing courses, most notably the Iowa Writers' Workshop. That was one of the first, if not <em>the</em> first, postgraduate-level courses in creative writing, and Chee studied on it.</p>
<p>But the book covers a lot else, too. As Chee is a mixed-race gay man, you won&rsquo;t be surprised to hear that those details feature in a number of the essays. As does living in New York and trying to make it as a writer. And growing roses, and the origin of Catholic rosary beads.</p>
<p>I was drawn to this because one of the essays was assigned reading on <a href="/categories/cwma">the MA</a> early this term, and he was also cited at various other points on at least two modules.</p>
<p>His debut novel is called <cite>Edinburgh</cite>, which immediately interests me. Though you learn from a couple of the essays that he hoped, when younger, to go to Edinburgh to <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/psychology/prospective/postgraduate/research-programmes/research-interests/parapsychology">study parapsychology</a>, but didn&rsquo;t; and that the Edinburgh connection in the novel didn&rsquo;t survive the writing and editing process, but he kept the title anyway.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what his fiction is like yet, but he&rsquo;s a fine essayist.</p>

			 <p>This is not, as you might have guessed from the title, about writing. It&rsquo;s about reading.</p>
<p>How long should we give a book by even a beloved author, before giving up on it, if we are not enjoying it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s relatively rare for me not to finish a book that I start. There are a few that I took a couple of runs at, having to start again &ndash; <cite>Ulysses</cite> springs to mind. And some that I haven&rsquo;t finished, and would have to start again: <cite>Gravity&rsquo;s Rainbow</cite>, <cite>Swann&rsquo;s Way</cite>. I might never bother with either of those again, but you never know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly sure I&rsquo;ll never get further than the the two or three pages I&rsquo;ve managed into <cite>Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake</cite>. And there&rsquo;s the odd other one I&rsquo;ve abandoned. One that I accidentally left on a train, and realised I didn&rsquo;t care. It was something to do with an excise inspector in Scotland. No idea what it was called or who it was by.</p>
<p>Most of those above are what people would call <em>difficult</em>: something about the style, form, or content makes reading them a challenge. Overcoming that challenge can be rewarding, but we should never feel guilty about abandoning them if we&rsquo;re not enjoying them, I feel. Reading for pleasure should not be a chore.</p>
<p>But now we come to a strange case. Claire North is an author I like a lot. <cite>The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August</cite> <a href="/blog/2015/03/06/the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august-by-claire-north-books-2015-2/">was great</a>, and so was <cite>Touch</cite>, which <a href="/blog/2019/07/14/cite-touch-cite-by-claire-north-books-2019-8/">I read</a> the last time I was out of the country.</p>
<p>So I was pleased to get her <cite>84k</cite> for Christmas. And I&rsquo;ve tried to read it twice, but I just can&rsquo;t get into it. It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s boring or hard to read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s <em>unpleasant</em>.</p>
<p>That probably doesn&rsquo;t make a huge amount of sense. Lots of books have unpleasant characters, or depict upsetting or hurtful events. Lots of <em>entertainment</em> shows those things, TV, movies, songs&hellip;</p>
<p>I have <a href="/blog/2018/08/16/gilded-cage-tarnished-city-and-bright-ruin-by-vic-james-books-2018-21-22-23/">mentioned here before</a> that I don&rsquo;t really care for dystopias as a subgenre.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I&rsquo;m not sure I can easily explain why that is, but they just don&rsquo;t appeal.</p>
<p>And this is set in one. It&rsquo;s largely a version of Britain, more or less present-day, but things have gone so far into privatisation, rampant capitalism, and generally Conservative party policies, that everyone knows the value of a human life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the title means. That&rsquo;s how much, in pounds, the rich have to pay to get away with murder. They can do anything else they want, too, as long as they can afford it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it will have a positive, maybe even uplifting, outcome. But I won&rsquo;t be carrying on with it. I got about thirty pages in on my second time of starting it (only a couple the first time), and it&rsquo;s just too bleak, too grim, for me to want to spend any more time there.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s partly the times were living in. But it&rsquo;s not for me.</p>

			 <p>Here we are at the end of the second term of <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">my masters</a>. In fact, the end of the taught part of the whole thing. Teaching is finished. In the summer term, which starts a month today, We have a series of lectures from various writing teachers and people from the writing and publishing fields. But no more seminars, no workshops, unless we, the students, organise them ourselves.</p>
<p>I have two 5000-word pieces to submit in a month‘s time &ndash; one for the Creative Nonfiction module, and the other for the Writing Workshop. After that it‘s just solid writing and editing until I submit my dissertation in September.</p>
<p>That‘s not quite the whole story. I will also have two meetings with my dissertation supervisor. Or actually, supervisor<em>s</em>, because we have been assigned two. The reasoning seems to be that more people seeing our work is a good thing. I can certainly see the sense of that. But at the same time I wonder whether we‘ll lose the advantage of continuity. What if the first one recommends some changes, I make them (or at least, integrate their suggestions with my own ideas), and then the second recommends their opposite?</p>
<p>Oh well, it probably won‘t happen, and I‘ll deal with it if it does.</p>
<p>As for the two pieces I‘m submitting in a month, right now I have the required number of words for both. So I have a month to manipulate them, structure them, and make sure they‘re the <em>best</em> words. A process we writers call ‘editing.‘</p>

			 <p>Phase one complete, for me. I&rsquo;m not long back from the vaccination centre (a vacant unit at the Westfield shopping centre, slightly weirdly) where I got my first dose of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. I can feel my immune system surging, boosted with superpowers, and a strange, unearthly calm descend upon me.</p>
<p>I exaggerate. But it feels pretty damn good to have taken this step. I don&rsquo;t get the next one until June, and it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;ll be out of the woods even then; not even personally, and certainly not the country or the world. Especially given the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/eu-medicines-regulator-to-report-on-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-safety">panic over a statistically meaningless set of blood clots</a>, and the news today that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/17/nhs-covid-vaccine-rollout-under-50s-delayed-major-shortage">the UK&rsquo;s supply is going to be temporarily constrained</a>.</p>
<p>But considering that it&rsquo;s only just over year since we learned about this virus and the terrible disease it brings, it&rsquo;s worth taking a moment to celebrate the scientists and doctors who were able to develop the vaccines so quickly. Not to mention all the NHS staff who are getting it to people.</p>

			 <p>This article was in yesterday&rsquo;s <cite>Independent</cite>. I felt like I had travelled back in time to last May:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crucially, the report, which was written by independent experts, concludes that NHS guidelines failed to consider airborne infection, a key way the virus is transmitted.</p>
<p>&ndash; Sean Russel in the <cite>Independent</cite>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nhs-covid-guidelines-nursing-union-b1813591.html">NHS Covid guidelines ‘fundamentally flawed’ and need replacing, says nursing union</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It further says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But research now suggests that airborne transmission – where tiny droplets of saliva from people talking, calling out or coughing can remain suspended in the air – can be a particular problem in poorly-ventilated rooms.</p>
<p>&ndash; As above, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nhs-covid-guidelines-nursing-union-b1813591.html"><cite>Independent</cite> article</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Now&rsquo;? Research <em>now</em> suggests that it&rsquo;s airborne? We&rsquo;ve known that since at least June of last year. In fact, <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/02/wear-a-mask-and-celebrate-your-immune-system/">I first posted</a> about masks, and about <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/11/%20mask-society/">going out with a rudimentary one</a>, in early April!</p>
<p>How can NHS guidelines be so ludicrously far from what we understand? It would be <em>comically</em> far if it wasn&rsquo;t so serious.</p>

			 <p>This book is infuriating. At times, and in certain ways, at least. Or not the book, but some of the characters.</p>
<p>For example, the parents, especially the dad &ndash; are so fucking pathetic it makes me angry. He can&rsquo;t even boil an egg for his kids' breakfast when his wife&rsquo;s away.</p>
<p>And throughout the early part you&rsquo;re wondering why do they both love Lydia much more than their other two kids? Even before she dies, I mean?</p>
<p>Oh, yes it&rsquo;s a dead girl story, did I mention that? Lydia is fridged in the first line, so it&rsquo;s not a spoiler. It&rsquo;s totally a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Refrigerators">fridging</a>, though. That page tells you that the term means killing a female character &lsquo;often as a plot device intended to move a male character&rsquo;s story arc forward.&rsquo; Lydia&rsquo;s death drives the whole plot, including the actions of her father and brother, so it definitely qualifies.</p>
<p>Her mother and little sister too, but that doesn&rsquo;t lessen the truth of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good exposition of a family with secrets at its heart. Though in the case of some of the secrets, there&rsquo;s no very good reason for the person to keep them secret. A lot of problems could have been avoided &ndash; including, probably, the death of Lydia &ndash; if people had just <em>talked</em> to each other. That&rsquo;s part of what&rsquo;s so infuriating about it at times.</p>
<p>But maybe that &ndash; the difficulties people, families, have in communicating &ndash; is the point.</p>
<p>I also wondered why she chose to set it in the time she does. The present day parts are in 1977-8. I think it&rsquo;s so that she can write about the particular immigrant experience she does: second and third generation Chinese immigrants to the US.</p>
<p>I picked this up because one of my tutors recommended it to me, due to its use of an omniscient narrator. I&rsquo;m trying something similar with something I&rsquo;m working on at the moment. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/books/review/the-return-of-omniscience.html">This article in the <cite>New York Times</cite></a> practically credits Ng with bringing omniscient narration back into fashion. I don&rsquo;t feel that it ever really went away, but maybe it has remained more common in SF than in literary fiction. Though as I write that I&rsquo;m not sure I could cite an example from recent SF either, so maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p><a href="https://deaddarlings.com/writing-quiet-omniscient-narrator-celeste-ng/">Here&rsquo;s a good article by Ng herself</a> about her decision to use the device. It&rsquo;s been useful to me, anyway. And I actually enjoyed the book, aside from being annoyed at times.</p>

			 <p>All through the Brexit debate, and after, people warned that it would cause problems in Northern Ireland. And now here we are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loyalist paramilitary groups have told the British and Irish governments they are withdrawing support for the Good Friday agreement in protest at Northern Ireland’s Irish Sea trade border with the rest of the UK.</p>

<p>&ndash; Robin Rendle, <a href="https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/inheritance.html">Inheritance</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happens to our websites after we&rsquo;re gone? There needs to be a way to memorialise them, make sure they&rsquo;re still around in some form. <a href="https://archive.org">Archive.org</a> is great, but it doesn&rsquo;t keep the canonical URLs alive. Famously, <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> wrote, &lsquo;<a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs Don&rsquo;t Change</a>.&rsquo; Disappearance is the biggest change of all.</p>
<p>Although I see from there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretty much the only good reason for a document to disappear from the Web is that the company which owned the domain name went out of business or can no longer afford to keep the server running.</p>
<p>&ndash; Tim Berners-Lee, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs Don&rsquo;t Change</a></p>

<p>Hmm, is that a <em>good</em> reason? and it&rsquo;s surprisingly slanted towards companies, considering the origin of the web, and <a href="https://home.cern">TBL&rsquo;s place of work</a>.</p>
<p>(And speaking of <em>cool</em> URIs &ndash; or domains &ndash; <code>home.cern</code>? That is fantastic!)</p>

			 <p>I got a <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenjjohnson/status/1362428938161688577">reply</a> to the <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/1362427111311511553">Twitter version</a> of my <a href="/blog/2021/02/18/152330/">last post</a> which pointed me to something called the <a href="https://making.engr.wisc.edu/mask-fitter/">Badger Seal</a>. It&rsquo;s a DIY attachment you can make that&rsquo;s meant to hold masks on better. Not just at the top for the glasses issue, but all around, for overall better filtration.</p>
<p>Because let&rsquo;s face it, when we breathe out with a mask on, a lot of that breath is <em>not</em> going through the mask, but round the sides.</p>
<p>It looks like it might be pretty effective, but making it looks like a hassle &ndash; or at least, getting the components. It needs something called &lsquo;foam wire,&rsquo; which I&rsquo;ve never heard of, and I don&rsquo;t know if you can even get it in this country (a quick search at B&amp;Q&rsquo;s site suggests not). But if you can, it&rsquo;s likely to be in a big roll, when all you want is 30cm or so per mask.</p>
<p>Not to put a downer on good ideas, I mean. That site sells them too, but they&rsquo;re heavily back ordered, and who knows how long they&rsquo;ll take to get here from the US.</p>
<p>There are other, similar, things out there, but I can&rsquo;t so far find anything sourced in the UK.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll <a href="/blog/2020/12/01/stop-your-glasses-steaming-up-by-sticking-the-top-of-your-mask-to-your-face-using-micropore-tape/">stick with micropore</a> for now.</p>

			 <p>It took me quite a long while to read this. I enjoyed it whenever I read a section, and I read it in large chunks at a time; but between times I wasn&rsquo;t particularly drawn back to it. I think that&rsquo;s probably because it doesn&rsquo;t have any significant plot.</p>
<p>Instead it&rsquo;s a series of character explorations, looking at a series of Black women (and a few men) over several decades of the twentieth century and the first two of the twenty-first.</p>
<p>Each story is compelling and enjoyable, and they&rsquo;re all interlinked &ndash; almost <em>too</em> interlinked at times, you might say, because there&rsquo;s an element of coincidence. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter: coincidences happen, after all.</p>
<p>Perhaps the major downside is that you get interested and invested in a character, and their chapter ends and we move on to another one. So it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re always starting fresh. Or fresh-ish. That&rsquo;s probably also part of why I had the experience I described at the start, of not being drawn back to it.</p>
<p>Because of <a href="/categories/cwma/">my course</a>, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the choices writers make. So I was particularly aware of Evaristo&rsquo;s unconventional choices regarding punctuation and capitalisation. Specifically, she capitalises proper nouns, but no other words. So sentences all start with lower-case letters. And she eschews almost all punctuation. Only  the comma, the apostrophe, the question mark, and an occasional exclamation mark, are used.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
{.has-dropcap}</p>
<p>No full stops means &ndash; and I only consciously realised this when looking it over to write this &ndash; that every sentence starts a new paragraph, and comprises the whole of the paragraph. Even when a sentence does end with a question mark or exclamation mark, she has it end the paragraph.</p>
<p>All of which is fine. I found it noticeable, but not distracting. I just wonder what the intended effect is. Some people say they find things like quotes to delineate speech intrusive, and I&rsquo;ve heard it said that leaving capitals off the start of sentences feels more informal. But I feel generally that most established conventions have good reasons for existing, and that the best approach is to keep to them, unless you have a very good reason for not doing so. I don&rsquo;t think this novel would in any way be lessened if it were capitalised and punctuated conventionally.</p>
<p>And then I would be talking more about the content, not the form.</p>

			 <p>It looks as if I haven&rsquo;t read anything yet this year. That&rsquo;s far from true, of course, but this is the first book-length work I&rsquo;ve finished. Though that &lsquo;book-length&rsquo; is extremely deceptive, as it&rsquo;s very short.</p>
<p>I read it for <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">my course</a> &ndash; specifically the Creative Nonfiction module that I&rsquo;m doing this term. It&rsquo;s a powerful statement about the position of Black people in America in the early 60s, when it was written. Things have sadly not changed much.</p>
<p>In terms of presentation, it&rsquo;s a little odd. It&rsquo;s titled as two letters: one <a href="https://progressive.org/magazine/letter-nephew/">to his nephew</a>, and another &lsquo;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/11/17/letter-from-a-region-in-my-mind">from a region in my mind</a>.&rsquo; The first is short, and does read as if it were a letter. The second, not so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a personal essay, combining memoir and political analysis. It shows a great deal of empathy, both for Black people and the white majority in his country. And it ends with a note of hope, that America can still become the country it claimed to be. I wonder what he&rsquo;d think of things now.</p>
<p>Both parts are available at those links, so you don&rsquo;t even have to buy it if you want to check it out, which you should.</p>

			 <p>At least in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/01/the-big-short-2015-12/">I watched the film <cite>The Big Short</cite></a> last year, I doubted that it would help people gain real understanding of financial markets and the problems that caused the crash of 2008-9:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might come out of this film with a better understanding of the events that led to the 2008 financial crisis — or you might not. More likely, I think, you’ll sort-of understand it while you’re watching, but be none the wiser when it’s all over.</p>
<p>&ndash; Me, <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/01/the-big-short-2015-12/">The Big Short, 2015 - ★★½</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I count myself very much in that none-the-wiser position, then and now. In particular, while I knew that the &lsquo;short&rsquo; involved somehow betting that the price of a share would go down, it had never clicked with me exactly <em>how</em> the &lsquo;short seller&rsquo; could make a profit.</p>
<p>Until today, when I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/_jimmykelly/status/1354600999835607041">this tweet</a>, apropos of the members of a subreddit bringing a hedge fund to bankruptcy, by taking advantage of the fund&rsquo;s short position. The tweet contains a screen grab of the written explanation, unfortunately, and the tweeter doesn&rsquo;t know the originator of the text, but here it is:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you to whoever explained this - <a href="https://twitter.com/reddit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@reddit</a> is incredible <br><br>😩🤙🏻 <a href="https://t.co/zKRlbP41gJ">pic.twitter.com/zKRlbP41gJ</a></p>&mdash; Jimmy Kelly (@_jimmykelly) <a href="https://twitter.com/_jimmykelly/status/1354600999835607041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The key step that I had never understood was the the short seller <em>borrows</em> the shares, and then sells them at the current price. If they drop in price, the seller buys them back and returns them to the original owner. I don&rsquo;t think I ever realised that you <em>could</em> borrow shares. If you can own something, you can borrow or lend it, I guess, even if it&rsquo;s imaginary, so it does make sense. If I had ever thought of it, I would have thought, well why would you borrow something that you can&rsquo;t do anything with?</p>
<p>But you <em>can</em> do something with it: sell it.</p>

			 <p>Four years ago, in a piece called &lsquo;<a href="/blog/2017/01/31/which-is-worse/">Which is Worse?</a>,&rsquo; I wrote that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brexit is worse than Trump, because Trump is only for four years — less if he gets impeached or twenty-fived, which is almost certain; but Brexit is forever.</p>
<p>&ndash; Me, <a href="/blog/2017/01/31/which-is-worse/">Which is Worse?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who would have thought, back then, that, while Trump would be gone (having been impeached not once but <em>twice</em>) but Brexit, in its final form, would only be getting started?</p>
<p>I use the word &lsquo;final&rsquo; facetiously. David Allen Green has been writing about this too, and he avers:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2016, American voters (via the electoral college) elected Trump for a term of four years, while those in the United Kingdom voted for Brexit with no similar fixed term.</p>
<p>One decision was set to be revisited in four years, the other was not.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>There will be no cathartic Biden-like ceremony to bring Brexit to a close.</p>
<p>This is because of the nature of the 2016 referendum (which, unlike the election of Trump, was not a decision for a fixed period); and because of the dynamic structure of the new relationship as set out in the trade and cooperation agreement; and because of the unsettled politics both internally in the United Kingdom and of its relationship with the European Union.</p>
<p>And so, to a significant (though not a total) extent, the United States was able to bring what it decided in 2016 to a formal and substantial end, the United Kingdom cannot similarly do so.</p>
<p>For the United Kingdom, 2016 is here to stay.</p>
<p>&ndash; David Allen Green, <a href="https://davidallengreen.com/2021/01/the-united-states-had-its-cathartic-post-2016-post-trump-ceremonial-moment-but-the-united-kingdom-cannot-have-a-similar-post-2016-post-brexit-moment/">The United States had its cathartic post-2016, post-Trump ceremonial moment – but the United Kingdom cannot have a similar post-2016, post-Brexit moment</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His &lsquo;here to stay,&rsquo; and my &lsquo;forever&rsquo; could be overstating the case. I feel sure that the United Kingdom, in some form, or at least parts of it, will join the European Union again one day. How far away that day is, and what form the accession country or countries of the time will have, we can only learn by living through it. It will be more than another four years, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

			 <p>Every month Google, or specifically the &lsquo;Google Search Console Team&rsquo; sends me an email showing the &lsquo;Top performing pages&rsquo; on my site. Presumably that means the ones to which they, Google, have sent the most people.</p>
<p>Consistently, the top one is a post from 2012, about a particular use case of <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>. Specifically: <a href="/blog/2012/07/02/tip-using-pandoc-to-create-truly-standalone-html-files/">Tip: using Pandoc to create truly standalone HTML files</a>.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clear that if I want more engagement here &ndash; or at least more drive-by readers &ndash; I should write more technical-support-type articles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unlikely to happen at the moment. That page was a complete mess, though. There were artifacts left over from WordPress plugins, and the whole thing was displaying at the wrong width for reasons that I don&rsquo;t understand. So I&rsquo;ve cleaned it up, and now at least it looks a bit more welcoming for the hundreds of visitors who come every month.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure what it describes is still necessary &ndash; Pandoc has had a lot of changes since then &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not <em>wrong</em>, so oh well.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of the pasta shape called bucatini before (though the Mac spellchecker has), but it sounds fabulous, and I want to try it now. I won&rsquo;t be able to, though (even if you can get it in the UK). This article by Rachel Handler in <cite>New York</cite> magazine is great: both hilarious and fascinating by turns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things first began to feel off in March. While this sentiment applies to everything in the known and unknown universe, I mean it specifically in regard to America’s supply of dry, store-bought bucatini. At first, the evidence was purely anecdotal. My boyfriend and I would bravely venture to both our local Italian grocer and our local chain groceries, masked beyond recognition, searching in vain for the bucatini that, in my opinion, not to be dramatic, is the only noodle worth eating; all other dry pastas might as well be firewood. But where there had once been abundance, there was now only lack. Being educated noodle consumers, we knew that there was, more generally, a pasta shortage due to the pandemic, but we were still able to find spaghetti and penne and orecchiette — shapes which, again, insult me even in concept. The missing bucatini felt different. It was specific. Frightening. Why bucatini? Why now? Why us?</p>

			 <p>The first of my Christmas books, so I <em>could</em> count it as next year&rsquo;s; but since I had finished it by the day after Boxing Day, it definitely belongs to this year. And it also brings me to a nice round 30 books for the year.</p>
<p>A writer is isolated in a lonely alpine chalet to write about a book he hates. Which very quickly turns out to be <cite>Frankenstein</cite>. He is visited by &ndash; well, that would be telling, but just let&rsquo;s say that the novel he&rsquo;s writing about and its creator are <em>very significant</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written &ndash; at least at first &ndash; as if it was the writer writing to his publisher, though that conceit soon disappears. There are various details around the way it&rsquo;s printed, that look as if they should be significant, but they aren&rsquo;t really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. Check it out.</p>

			 <p>Well, this year of infamy is finally lurching towards its end. I don&rsquo;t think too many of us will be sad to see the back of 2020.</p>
<p>With it, though, we have to also say a final goodbye to Britain&rsquo;s membership of the European Union. I don&rsquo;t think too many of us will be happy about that. Even people who are pleased about it now will realise over time that leaving is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>At least with the exit agreement in place, we shouldn&rsquo;t see the immediate shortages and queues at the ports that we feared. That agreement is problematic, though.</p>
<p>To get an example of its dangers, I refer you to David Allen Green&rsquo;s Law and Policy Blog. Yesterday&rsquo;s post is entitled &lsquo;<a href="https://davidallengreen.com/2020/12/the-bill-implementing-the-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-is-an-exercise-in-the-government-taking-power-from-parliament/">The Bill implementing the Trade and Cooperation Agreement is an exercise in the Government taking power from Parliament</a>,&rsquo; and in it he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The draft bill is complex and deals with several specific technical issues, such as criminal records, security, non-food product safety, tax and haulage, as well as general implementation provisions.</p>
<p>Each of these specific technical issues would warrant a bill, taking months to go through the normal parliamentary process.</p>
<p>But instead they will be whizzed and banged through in a single day, with no real scrutiny, as the attention of parliamentarians will (understandably) be focused on the general implementation provisions, which are in Part 3 of the draft bill.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>This provision will empower ministers (or the devolved authorities, where applicable) to make regulations with the same effect as if those regulations were themselves acts of parliament.</p>
<p>In other words: they can amend laws and repeal (or abolish) laws, with only nominal parliamentary involvement.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions (under clause 31(4)), but even with those exceptions, this is an extraordinarily wide power for the executive to legislate at will.</p>
<p>These clauses are called ‘Henry VIII’ clauses and they are as notorious among lawyers as that king is notorious in history.</p>
<p>Again, this means that parliament (and presumably the devolved assemblies, where applicable) will be bypassed, and what is agreed between Whitehall and Brussels will be imposed without any further parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ndash; David Allen Green, <a href="https://davidallengreen.com/2020/12/the-bill-implementing-the-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-is-an-exercise-in-the-government-taking-power-from-parliament/">The Bill implementing the Trade and Cooperation Agreement is an exercise in the Government taking power from Parliament</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole piece is worth reading (and note the <cite>Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</cite> references).</p>
<p>Take back control, right enough: take it back from the elected representatives of the people, and give it to the executive.</p>
<p>2020 made 2016 look like 2012. 2021 offers hope to the world as the Covid vaccines roll out, and hope for America as Trump is rolled out of the White House. But things still look decidedly dodgy here in the UK.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/12/31/xstabeth-by-david-keenan-books/">Xstabeth by David Keenan (Books 2020, 29)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/12/31/xstabeth-by-david-keenan-books/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-12-31 11:20:10 &#43;0100">Dec 31, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Following on <a href="/blog/2020/12/11/the-towers-the-fields-the-transmitters-by-david-keenan-books-2020-27/">from number 27</a>, then, we have David Keenan&rsquo;s latest novel. Again we&rsquo;re in a kind of magic-realist setting, without any obvious magic. In St Petersburg a young woman lives with her father, who is a failed or fading musician. The daughter &ndash; who is the viewpoint character &ndash; starts a relationship with her father&rsquo;s friend, and gets pregnant. She keeps all of this from her father.</p>
<p>Her father, meanwhile, puts on a show at which he performs some seemingly-otherworldly music. He starts to believe that it was actually created by some sort of mystical entity called Xstabeth.</p>
<p>For reasons that escape me at the moment they go to St Andrews,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> where they get involved with a professional golfer. The &lsquo;tenuous, ambiguous, confusing event&rsquo; that I referred to in the earlier note happens from this side too, but you&rsquo;d only notice it if you&rsquo;d read <cite>The Towers The Fields The Transmitters</cite>.</p>
<p>The novel is presented as if it were an academic work <em>about</em> a novel called <cite>Xstabeth</cite>, by someone called &lsquo;David Keenan,&rsquo; who killed himself by jumping from a tower in St Andrews. So there are cod-academic sections or extracts between the chapters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very meta, and I enjoyed it, but I&rsquo;m not sure I totally understood it. The strangest thing about it, in some ways, is the use of punctuation. Almost the only punctuation used is the full stop. But that doesn&rsquo;t just mean he&rsquo;s avoided using commas and semicolons, and constructed appropriately short sentences. It reads as if he wrote it with conventional punctuation around dialogue and so on, and then replaced every other mark with the full stop.</p>
<p>For example, consider this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is singular. He said. This is music that cannot be repeated. This is music that can never be toured. This is music that can never be applauded. I pointed out to him that there was applause on the record. Muted Applause. Awkward applause. Uncomprehending applause. But still. Applause. What is the sound of one audience member clapping. I asked him. He laughed. Yes. He said. Yes. Yes. There is no mechanic in the world for this music. He said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more conventional way to punctuate that and lay it out, might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;This is singular,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;This is music that cannot be repeated; this is music that can never be toured; this is music that can never be applauded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I pointed out to him that there was applause on the record. Muted applause; awkward applause; uncomprehending applause; but still: applause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the sound of one audience member clapping?&rsquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>He laughed. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;yes, yes. There is no mechanic in the world for this music,&rsquo; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are, of course, other ways you could present it. As an experimental way of presenting text, it&rsquo;s interesting enough. I found it intruded, in that I constantly noticed it; but not so much as to be annoying. Though there were places where it was slightly confusing. I paid particular attention to it because we recently discussed ways to present dialogue on <a href="/categories/cwma/">my course</a>.</p>

			 <p>Just when you think that this Tory government couldn&rsquo;t possibly sink any lower, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it is a real scandal that Unicef should be playing politics in this way when it is meant to be looking after people in the poorest, the most deprived, countries of the world where people are starving, where there are famines and where there are civil wars, and they make cheap political points of this kind, giving, I think, 25,000 to one council.

			 <p>Strange one, this. I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/09/08/this-is-memorial-device-by-david-keenan-books-2018-24/">read Keenan&rsquo;s <cite>This is Memorial Device</cite></a> a couple of years ago, so when I saw a new one by him listed on <a href="https://pagesofhackney.co.uk">my local bookshop&rsquo;s</a> &lsquo;forthcoming&rsquo; page, I had a look.</p>
<p>That book was <a href="https://www.thesocial.com/gnostic-golf-epiphanies-with-david-keenan/"><cite>Xstabeth</cite></a>, and more on it <a href="/blog/2020/12/31/xstabeth-by-david-keenan-books-2020-29/">in a few posts' time</a>. It hadn&rsquo;t yet been released at the time, but there was a special offer from the publishers: upload proof that you had preordered it (such as the receipt from your local bookshop) and you&rsquo;d get a free novella-length ebook prequel: <cite>The Towers The Fields The Transmitters</cite>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So I did all that, and here we are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll note right away that, having read both, they seem to be connected only by location and one tenuous, ambiguous, confusing event.</p>
<p>In fact those terms apply throughout this book. It&rsquo;s kind of a magical realism piece, set mostly in St Andrews.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A businessman visits the town to audit the books of a military facility, and starts trying to find his missing daughter. Why does he think she might be in St Andrews? That is never explained. Nor does it need to be.</p>
<p>Time goes weird, with second-world-war bombers appearing in the skies. Or on the phone, at least.</p>
<p>The more I try to write about this, the more it feels like a hallucination I had a few weeks ago. Very strange. Worth reading.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I tried removing my taped-on mask slowly, and it was actually much better. So I rescind <a href="/blog/2020/12/01/stop-your-glasses-steaming-up-by-sticking-the-top-of-your-mask-to-your-face-using-micropore-tape/">my advice from the day before</a> about removing it quickly.</p>

			 <h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>If, like all sensible people, you wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you go out these days; and if, like me and millions of others, you wear glasses; then you will have experienced your breath causing your glasses to steam up.</p>
<p>The cause is a fundamental flaw in mask design: the mask fabric makes a straight line from our cheeks to the bridge of our noses, leaving a gap between face and mask seam. Most of our out-breaths are directed that way, just by taking the path of least resistance.</p>
<p>Some masks have a wire insert that lets you mould the top section around your nose. I find that improves things, but is still imperfect. There are always gaps.</p>
<h2 id="the-bigger-problem">The Bigger Problem</h2>
<p>This means that the masks are not as effective as they should be for their primary purpose. All that warm, damp air that&rsquo;s condensing on our glasses is <em>also</em> the air that might be carrying virus particles.</p>
<p>So while this solution helps with the steamed-up glasses problem, it also helps to make masks more effective, by ensuring that more of our potentially-poisonous breath goes through the fabric.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite simple: apply a strip of micropore tape to the section of the mask that goes over the bridge of your nose, and seal it down well.</p>
<figure>
      <img src="/uploads/2023/mask-and-micropore.jpeg" title="Mask and Micropore" alt="A COVID-19-type facemask lying on a surface alongside a roll of micropore tape." />
      <figcaption>Mask and Micropore</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Micropore tape is normally used for fixing dressings on wounds, so it&rsquo;s designed to stick to skin and come off with minimal fuss (though see below).</p>
<p>The roll we had when I thought of this is quite wide, so I&rsquo;ve been folding a piece over and attaching it to the inside of the mask (at <a href="http://twitter.com/FranChats">@FranChats</a>&rsquo;s suggestion).</p>
<figure>
      <img src="/uploads/2023/mask-with-micropore.jpeg" title="Mask With Micropore" alt="A COVID-19-type facemask with a piece of micropore tape attached." />
      <figcaption>Mask With Micropore</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s not attached very tidily, but we&rsquo;re not in this for the aesthetics.</p>

      <figcaption>Martin With Mask With Micropore</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not actually visible when the mask is on.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-problems-removal-and-sensitivity">The New Problems: Removal, and Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Taking the taped mask off is the worst part, in my experience. I&rsquo;ve been doing it quickly: take off my glasses (otherwise they might go flying across the room); unhook the ear loops and take a firm grip of them; close my eyes; then tug sharply forward.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It can make your eyes water, but honestly, for clear vision outside on these cold days, it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>Removing it slowly might be better for some people. And the whole thing will not be for some. If you have very sensitive skin, or get a reaction to the adhesive, then this won&rsquo;t be for you. But if you can take it, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Lastly, my pictures show a reusable mask, but it works for disposables too.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/11/21/fear-and-loathing-on-the/">Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail 72 by Hunter S Thompson (Books 2020, 26)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/11/21/fear-and-loathing-on-the/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-11-21 10:44:32 &#43;0100">Nov 21, 2020</time></a>

			 <p>I thought it might be interesting, in this year of a US presidential election, to reread this account of a different reelection campaign of a terrible president.</p>
<p>In this one, of course, the president &ndash; Nixon &ndash; was successfully reelected. And it was only in his second term that he was impeached &ndash; or nearly so. He resigned first, and Ford, his veep, now president, pardoned him. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if Trump and Pence try the same sort of thing in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>This book doesn&rsquo;t get as far as Nixon&rsquo;s resignation. Thompson followed the Democratic campaign, and then George McGovern&rsquo;s campaign once he got the nomination, as part of the press pack. He was National Affairs Editor for <cite>Rolling Stone</cite> at the time. A title and role that he created.</p>
<p>So this is essentially a fix-up of his columns, with some edits, and the odd footnote adding information that wasn&rsquo;t available at the time. It&rsquo;s classic HST, of course, with not quite as many illegal drugs as in some of his works.</p>
<p>The most intriguing thing in the whole book for me was this quote from p189:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For almost a year now, he [Pat Cadell] has been George McGovern&rsquo;s official numbers wizard. Cadell and his <strong>Cambridge Research Associates</strong> have been working the streets and suburban neighborhoods in New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts for McGovern, then coming back to headquarters on election nite [sic] and calling the results almost down to the percentage point&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine, ellipsis his. I&rsquo;m just struck by the name of the organisation, and the fact that they&rsquo;re doing a not dissimilar thing to Cambridge Analytica &ndash; in terms of analysis, if not manipulation &ndash; in a pre-computer age. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any connections between the two organisations.</p>
<p>On the very next page we have this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even reading and watching <em>all the news</em>, there is no way to know the truth &ndash; except to be there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which resonates profoundly in today&rsquo;s &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; world.</p>

			 <p>Read this for my course. It&rsquo;s very good, unsurprisingly. Historical fiction isn&rsquo;t usually my thing (Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/tag/baroque-cycle/"><cite>The Baroque Cycle</cite></a> notwithstanding) It has a striking stylistic tic &ndash; if that&rsquo;s the right word &ndash; in the way she refers to Thomas Cromwell. It&rsquo;s always &lsquo;he said,&rsquo;  or &lsquo;he did such-and-such&rsquo;; very occasionally, for clarity, &lsquo;he, Cromwell&hellip;&rsquo; But never just, &lsquo;Cromwell said&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not a big deal, but in a work of this size, it stands out. It feels <em>significant</em>. And it is; &lsquo;tic&rsquo; is the wrong word for something so definite, so chosen. Mantel has said that she wanted the viewpoint to be &lsquo;over Cromwell&rsquo;s shoulder.&rsquo; So &lsquo;he&rsquo;, rather than &lsquo;Cromwell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of the most subtle things about it as how Cromwell switches from just being an advisor to the king to rounding up certain priests, and I don’t really understand how it happened. It&rsquo;s a masterpiece of characterisation.</p>

			 <p>I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure about this at first. I know it won awards and all that. It was assigned for the &lsquo;Genre&rsquo; module of my <a href="/categories/cwma/">Creative Writing masters</a>,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but it didn&rsquo;t immediately grab me.</p>
<p>But I came round to it. It&rsquo;s set in the very far future, because there are examples of technology that is old, but people don&rsquo;t understand it. Reminiscent of <a href="/blog/2006/11/01/book-notes-14-viriconium-by-m-john-harrison/"><cite>Viriconium</cite></a> or <a href="/blog/2018/06/17/against-a-dark-background-by-iain-m-banks-books-2018-13/"><cite>Against A Dark Background</cite></a> in that way. And &lsquo;Home is the pink one&rsquo; &ndash; star &ndash; suggests that Sol has got very old. Like, billions of years older than now. Which feels wrong, because humans should have changed a lot more in that time.</p>
<p>The titular character is the first of her people to leave Earth (we assume it&rsquo;s Earth, anyway) to go to Oomza University, which appears to be a whole planet that&rsquo;s a university, and takes people from many different species and civilisations.</p>
<p>Things happen on the way, as you might expect. It&rsquo;s good, and I&rsquo;m keen to read the sequels.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;re halfway through the first term of my <a href="/categories/cwma/">Creative Writing masters</a> course. Those five weeks went fast, but 2020 is The Year When Time Was Weird, for everyone. How is it going, you ask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Pretty well, thanks. At first glance, with only two actual sessions, the workload looked light. But as is common with postgraduate courses, you have a lot of work to do on your own. Add to that, it&rsquo;s a <em>writing</em> course: we have to write, and you can&rsquo;t do that while sitting in a class.</p>
<p>Or you could, for small exercises, and I think maybe they would be asking us to do that kind of thing if this were a conventional year and we were sitting in a seminar room in Bloomsbury. It is, however, the most unconventional of years, and we are sitting in our own homes on Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>There are two modules. Everyone does the Writing and Reading Seminar, where we focus on short stories. Each week we read and discuss two or three assigned stories, with there being a theme or area of focus: Character, Voice, Territory, for example. Then we workshop pieces submitted by three members of the class. Everyone gets to submit a piece of up to 4000 words, twice this term.</p>
<p>For my first piece I decided to get out of my comfort zone (such as it is) and write a purely realist piece. No spaceships, no magic; no element of the fantastic whatsoever. I think it worked out pretty well.</p>
<p>Those pieces are not assessed, but in January we have to submit a 4000-word piece that will be. I only recently learned that this piece has to be a reworking of one of the two pieces we&rsquo;ll have workshopped in class. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have done anything differently, but I would have liked to have known that sooner.</p>
<p>The second module I&rsquo;m doing is called Contemporary Writing 2: Genre<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, or just &lsquo;Genre.&rsquo;  We spend two weeks on each of these genres: crime, science fiction, historical fiction, and young adult fiction.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> There&rsquo;s a novel assigned for each one. The first week has a two short, prerecorded lectures, and in the seminar we discuss those, and techniques, and the assigned novel.</p>
<p>For the second week we each write a 1000-word piece in the genre in question, and some of us have the pieces workshopped. We got to choose the genres in which we wanted to be workshopped. I chose SF and crime. Even those of us who aren&rsquo;t being workshopped in a given week have our pieces discussed on the class forum.</p>
<p>So as you can see, there&rsquo;s quite a lot of reading, analysis, and commenting, as well as actual writing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying it a lot, but if you were to ask me what I&rsquo;ve learned, I&rsquo;m not sure I could specify that yet. However, the practice, the fact of looking at my own writing and that of others, professionally-published and not, in great detail: that alone is bound to improve my writing, I feel.</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s reading week. I don&rsquo;t recall having such a thing back when I was an undergraduate, but maybe we did. They&rsquo;re standard now, just like half-term breaks at school.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> So we have no classes, and some extra short stories to read, and time to catch up on the novels. I finished <cite>Wolf Hall</cite> yesterday, so I only have <cite>The Hate U Give</cite> to read for YA. Plenty of time to get some writing done.</p>
<p>Oh, and a couple of homework assignments, too. All work is homework, of course.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

<p>I&rsquo;m always confused about how you should punctuate that idiom. I&rsquo;m asking a question: it needs a question mark. But neither of these look right:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is it going? you ask.</li>
<li>How is it going, you ask?</li>
</ul>
<p>It should really be:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;How is it going?&rsquo; you ask.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that makes it too much like I&rsquo;m writing dialogue in a a second-person narrative, and it doesn&rsquo;t really fit with the overall feel of a blog post.</p>

<p>It was during my primary school years that Scotland introduced the week-long half-term break in October. &lsquo;The October Week,&rsquo; as it was called, and it was definitely a new thing at the time.

I can&rsquo;t find any evidence of it now, because there are so many other pages about half-term holiday dates and history projects for October half term.

<p>Of course, since most of the time there&rsquo;s nothing much happening, they&rsquo;re having a hard time of it.</p>

			 <p>Robin Rendle writes about writing about typography, but he has lessons for all of us who want to write well.</p>
<p>Though I don&rsquo;t entirely agree with his viewpoint about the particular sentence he criticises. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A revival is based on historical models, made suitable for contemporary use, adapted to the typographical and technical needs of today, but nevertheless relies on a personal response to the historical style.</p>
<p>&ndash; The Rosart Project, <a href="https://www.rosart.nl/">The Rosart Project</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &lsquo;revival&rsquo; it&rsquo;s talking about involves  recreating old typefaces, and/or building new versions of them. It&rsquo;s from a site called <a href="https://www.rosart.nl/">The Rosart Project</a>, set up by some students of typography.</p>
<p>Rendle&rsquo;s essay at an improved version of that sentence is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Type designers will often look at letterforms that were made in the past and then redraw them for modern day use. This is called a “revival” by the type community but I like to think of it as a remix: a type designer will unavoidably apply their own style and harmonies, their own deviations and melodies to the song.</p>
<p>Every remix is different, every remix is important.</p>
<p>&ndash; Robin Rendle, <a href="http://robinrendle.com/notes/writing-about-typography.html">Writing about Typography</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is certainly brighter, has a bit more sparkle, and arguably is easier to understand. But I don&rsquo;t think the original is <em>that</em> bad. Certainly not as bad as Rendle thinks. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what does any of this mean? The words make sense but it’s written in a style that’s familiar to anyone that reads about the field of typography. It’s what’s known to folks outside the field as “academic writing” but it’s what I consider to simply be bad writing—it’s waffling and unclear.</p>
<p>&ndash; Robin Rendle, <a href="http://robinrendle.com/notes/writing-about-typography.html">Writing about Typography</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s what is often called <em>dry</em>, I&rsquo;d say, certainly compared to the alternative. But I don&rsquo;t think it deserves quite the fire he brings to it. Of course he&rsquo;s only doing it &ndash; he says, and I believe him &ndash; because he loves the project, and wants to &lsquo;see the whole typographic community break the shackles of this style of writing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Which is fair enough. I&rsquo;d certainly rather read a piece in Rendle&rsquo;s style than much academic writing. So I guess maybe I do agree with him after all. His final advice to the typographic community could apply just about anywhere where words are used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>write to swoon, to convince, to make a stranger fall in love. Abandon the academic style, because it’s making your beautiful work so very boring.</p>

<p>ideas for rethinking blogs and feeds. I found, as others have, that I need another kind of document to include in my personal CMS other than a story that&rsquo;s part of the blog. Everything about blogs are set up to be written, then lightly edited, and never touched again. It&rsquo;s <strong>temporal</strong> writing. But there are other things that I want to develop over time, keep coming back to, revising. A few years back I started this.how to hold those docs.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s talking about what I like to call &lsquo;web pages,&rsquo; surely? You don&rsquo;t need any fancy CMS for those, as Dave of all people should know. And if you want to use such a thing, well, even WordPress has its Posts/Pages distinction.</p>

			 <p>A few years ago <a href="/blog/2017/07/19/not-the-nails-im-looking-for/">I wrote about how I was notified about the wrong band called (The) Nails</a>. In that case the names were different, though only by the subtle presence or absence of the definite article. Things have got even more confusing recently.</p>
<p>I have an app on my phone called <a href="https://apps.Apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750">Music Harbor</a> (sic). The idea is, you give it access to your music library, and it notifies you of forthcoming releases by artists you already have tracks by. It sometimes throws up some oddities, like people I&rsquo;ve never heard of just because they&rsquo;re &lsquo;<a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/06/little-feat/">featured</a>&rsquo; on something I have. But mostly it&rsquo;s pretty good. It&rsquo;s how I know that Bruce Springsteen has a new album coming out in a few days, for example.</p>
<p>A few years back I heard a track called &lsquo;Bass Down Low,&rsquo; by someone called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev_(singer)">Dev</a>. I liked it, both musically and lyrically. I mean, it&rsquo;s not <em>profound</em>, but &lsquo;I like my beats fast and my bass down low&rsquo; is a sentiment I can get behind.</p>
<p>So there was a new track by Dev out today. However, the guy rapping on &lsquo;<a href="https://music.Apple.com/gb/album/el-erb-single/1536393357">El Erb</a>&rsquo;, is <em>not</em>, I feel sure, Dev, the female singer &amp; rapper of &lsquo;Bass Down Low.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a scunner of a name to search for, what with it being an abbreviation for developer, <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/09/03/on-devs/">the TV show</a>, and Google completely owning the <code>.dev</code> top-level domain.</p>
<p>Multiple people with the same name: it&rsquo;s a problem. It&rsquo;s why actors have <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/about/equity-name/">Equity names</a>, I guess.</p>
<p>Still, there should be no problem with the early nineties <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bis_(Scottish_band)">Scottish indiepoppers Bis</a>, right? Who&rsquo;d have thought they&rsquo;d be back with a new single, this long after &lsquo;The Secret Vampire EP&rsquo;?</p>
<p>No-one, it turns out. This Bis is someone else (and his single &lsquo;<a href="https://music.Apple.com/gb/album/streets/1536096221?i=1536096222">Streets</a>&rsquo; is also nothing to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Streets">The Streets</a>).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It&rsquo;s also hard to search for, not least because it&rsquo;s an abbreviation for several different organisations. I even used to work for a company called BIS.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the English language is running out of names, but if you&rsquo;re planning on using a short one as your professional persona or brand, you probably want to check out whether or not someone has already used it in your field. Though it&rsquo;s not always that
easy, as I&rsquo;ve noted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even a music magazine called <cite><a href="https://clashmusic.com">Clash</a></cite>, which has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.theclash.com/">The Clash</a>.</p>
<p>Still, &lsquo;Sugar sugar kandy pop/Push it down and pull it up,&rsquo; as I&rsquo;m sure we can all agree.</p>

			 <p>In the <cite>New York Times</cite> Daniel C Dennett <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/books/review/the-weirdest-people-in-the-world-joseph-henrich.html">reviews</a> a book by Joseph Henrich called <cite>The Weirdest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous</cite>. Sounds like an interesting book, and the review itself is engaging. I just wanted to note a few points.</p>
<p>First, we have the acronym WEIRD, which stands for &ldquo;Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic.&rdquo; Apparently being WEIRD makes us weird, in psychological terms. Non-WEIRD and WEIRD people have differences that can be observed, measured.</p>
<p>I was intrigued by this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To point to just one striking example: Normal, meaning non-WEIRD, people use left and right hemispheres of their brains about equally for facial recognition, but we WEIRD people have co-opted left-hemisphere regions for language tasks, and are significantly worse at recognizing faces than the normal population. Until recently few researchers imagined that growing up in a particular culture could have such an effect on functional neuroanatomy.</p>
<p>&ndash; Daniel C Dennett, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/books/review/the-weirdest-people-in-the-world-joseph-henrich.html">Why Are We in the West So Weird? A Theory</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if this can apply on an individual scale: are people whose focus has been language less able to recognise faces? Answering just from within my own head, I&rsquo;d say maybe? I&rsquo;ve been what my Dad used to call a compulsive reader all my life, as well as being at <a href="/categories/cwma/">least somewhat interested in writing</a>, and I&rsquo;m very poor at facial recognition. Bordering on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia">prosopagnosia</a>, I sometimes think (though far from anything like the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-53192821">poor woman in this story</a>, who can&rsquo;t even recognise herself in a mirror).</p>
<p>If my experience suggests that, I have counter examples right in my own family. My beloved and our daughter are both linguists, and both border (to my mind) on being <a href="https://www.associationofsuperrecognisers.org">super recognisers</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, which is the complete opposite of me.</p>
<p>None of which tells us anything useful, except maybe that the ability to recognise faces, like many things, exists on a scale.</p>
<p>More interestingly, Dennett introduces (to me, at least) the delightful term &lsquo;Occam&rsquo;s Broom&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good statistician (which I am not) should scrutinize the many uses of statistics made by Henrich and his team. They are probably all sound but he would want them examined rigorously by the experts. That’s science. Experts who don’t have the technical tools — historians and anthropologists especially — have an important role to play as well; they should scour the book for any instances of Occam’s broom (with which one sweeps inconvenient facts under the rug).</p>

<p>Occam had a famous razor; why wouldn&rsquo;t he have a broom as well?</p>

			 <p>This is a book about history, biography, gender &ndash; and writing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s presented as a biography of the titular character, who starts as the son of a noble family. It&rsquo;s written for, and partly based an the life of, Woolf&rsquo;s friend Vita Sackville-West.</p>
<p>Famously, Orlando&rsquo;s gender (or biological sex) changes partway through the novel. She spends the latter part of it as a woman. She also lives for four or five hundred years &ndash; and presumably is living still. She&rsquo;s barely got started by the end of the book.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The interesting thing about the time difference is that he/she doesn&rsquo;t <em>experience</em> the passage of hundreds of years, as far as we are shown. It&rsquo;s like time passes at a different rate for her. She reaches the age of around 30, but the world has moved on through ages around her.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this greatly, and as I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/08/27/woolf-banks/">said a while back</a>, it sparked some ideas and made me think of associations with Iain Banks. Which can&rsquo;t be bad.</p>

			 <p>Announcing a big life change: I&rsquo;m going to be starting a masters course in a couple of weeks. An <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/study/2020/postgraduate/programmes/TMACWRIT_C">MA in Creative Writing, at Birkbeck, University of London</a>.</p>
<h1 id="nine-months-in-slippers">Nine Months in Slippers</h1>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here, Martin?&rdquo; I hear you ask. Let me take you back to November last year. I lost my job. The reasons are obscure and not that interesting, but I had been working at <a href="https://www.spika.com">SPIKA</a> for only six months, and suddenly I was out on the street.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>If that had happened a couple of months sooner, I might have been studying all this time. I had been vaguely musing on the idea of doing a masters in journalism. I love to write, and I sometimes think that I kind of missed a calling.</p>
<p>I was too late for 2019, all the university terms having already started. So I did a bit of job hunting, but mainly took a break till after Christmas.</p>
<p>When this year that we had no idea was going to be so terrible started, I started looking for jobs, but I also kept thinking about journalism. I started a distance-learning course. Learned a bit of shorthand, and read up on some of the other aspects of the craft. A journalism MA, starting this year, was still on the table.</p>
<p>Then Coronavirus arrived.</p>
<p>To be honest, the lockdown didn&rsquo;t change things that much for me: I was at home all the time anyway. But the jobs market, as well as the rest of the world, was affected. It&rsquo;s easy to work from home in software development, but recruitment was down. I had a few interviews, but no success.</p>
<p>Then somewhere in there I decided that journalism wasn&rsquo;t for me after all. There are aspects of the profession that didn&rsquo;t appeal to me: newsgathering and all that side of it, essentially. I&rsquo;d like to be a columnist or maybe a feature writer, but not so much a reporter. Perhaps more importantly, it&rsquo;s a terrible time for journalism, with newsrooms laying people off and cutting back.</p>
<p>I kept looking for jobs back in software development. But after a bit, Frances said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do a masters in your own field?&rdquo; It was a good idea: it would be intellectually stimulating, and possibly improve my employability. I started looking at courses.</p>
<p>Computer science itself (I&rsquo;ve never formally studied it), or one of the various data science options? Both had their merits. Either would have been interesting and mentally challenging.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/what-does-marie-kondo-mean-when-she-says-spark-joy/">spark joy</a>, to use a tidiness-related term that <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/does-it-spark-joy-is-the-wrong-decluttering-question/">seems appropriate</a>. I looked at the course outlines, and they were interesting enough, but I could tell I wouldn&rsquo;t have <em>loved</em> doing them.</p>
<p>There were other subjects, though, and one kept prodding my mind; one that <em>did</em> offer the prospect of joy, the possibility that I would love it.</p>
<p>Like I said, I love to write.</p>
<h1 id="choosing">Choosing</h1>
<p>Quite a few institutions offer creative writing MAs, in various forms. I applied to all of them. All the ones in London, anyway, and a few others that offer distance learning. Each needed a personal statement and a sample of writing. Every single one had unique requirements of the sample, in terms of word length and type of piece. Royal Holloway, for example (who rejected me), wanted a short story extract and, uniquely, a piece of critical writing. Most just wanted the fiction.</p>
<p>There were differences in the course titles, too. London Met&rsquo;s was &lsquo;<a href="https://www.londonmet.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/creative-digital-and-professional-writing---ma/">Creative, Digital, and Professional Writing</a>.&rsquo; Westminster&rsquo;s was &lsquo;<a href="https://www.westminster.ac.uk/english-and-creative-writing-courses/2020-21/january/full-time/creative-writing-writing-the-city-ma">Creative Writing: Writing the City</a>,&rsquo; though they had closed entry for this year.</p>
<p>City, University of London has several. But the plain &lsquo;<a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/creative-writing">Creative Writing</a>&rsquo; was showing a message to the effect of &lsquo;Applications suspended.&rsquo; I emailed to ask if this meant that they were full for the year, and was told that no, they had suspended entry for 2020 because there wasn&rsquo;t enough interest. So I applied for another one they have, &lsquo;<a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/creative-writing-and-publishing">Creative Writing and Publishing</a>.&rsquo; They got back to me after a few days and said the course was full. Seems to be a slight disconnect there, maybe?</p>
<p>I got offers from London Met, <a href="https://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/creative-writing-distance-learning-ma/">Kingston</a> (by distance learning), and Birkbeck. Birkbeck were the only ones who interviewed me first (I still haven&rsquo;t heard back from several, and Glasgow&rsquo;s website was too broken to let me apply &ndash; and they didn&rsquo;t reply to my query). And just today, <a href="https://www.tees.ac.uk/postgraduate_courses/English_&amp;_Creative_Writing/MA_Creative_Writing_(Online).cfm">Teeside, another distance learning one</a>, offered me a place. Far, far too late. I shouldn&rsquo;t criticise, though, since I was very late in applying.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons I decided Birkbeck was the best of the offers, not least that I liked <a href="https://www.juliabell.net">Julia Bell</a>, the course leader, who interviewed me from her shed. Birkbeck is &lsquo;London&rsquo;s evening university.&rsquo; It was set up to provide adult education to people who are working. All the classes are in the evenings.</p>
<h1 id="why-and-why-now">Why, and Why Now?</h1>
<p>This is probably something I should have done thirty years ago, but we didn&rsquo;t know about masterses back then. Well, I didn&rsquo;t, anyway. And I don&rsquo;t think creative writing masters courses existed at all.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Anyway, as the saying more or less has it, the best time was then; the second-best time is now.</p>
<p>Will it help me be a better writer? I damn well hope so. Beyond that, we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.</p>
<h1 id="and-beyond">And Beyond…</h1>
<p>What comes after this? In an ideal world I&rsquo;ll make my living as a writer. I&rsquo;m well aware how hard that is to achieve, though, so I might end up going back to programming. The best might be some sort of hybrid. We&rsquo;ll see, but I&rsquo;m not going to worry too much about it for the next year or so.</p>
<p>One thing I do plan to do is to blog about the course as I do it, so expect to see more here.</p>

			 <p>John Crace, writing his <cite>Guardian</cite> parliamentary sketch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If he was a decent man, he would apologise,” Starmer said. But Boris isn’t a decent man, so he didn’t. Instead he continued to rush on his run.</p>
<p>&ndash; John Crace, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/02/boris-left-flailing-as-pms-limitations-become-clear-for-all-to-see">Boris left flailing as his limitations become clear for all to see</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any Velvet Underground fan immediately recognises that as reference to their song &lsquo;Heroin&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I&rsquo;m rushing on my run<br>
And I feel just like Jesus' son<br>
And I guess that I just don&rsquo;t know<br>
And I guess that I just don&rsquo;t know</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if &lsquo;to rush on one&rsquo;s run&rsquo; is a common expression among heroin addicts, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/25/how-i-overcame-my-heroin-addiction-and-started-to-live">John Crace has been there himself</a>, so presumably knows what he&rsquo;s talking about. Is he, then, trying to tell us something about Boris Johnson&rsquo;s predilections?</p>
<p>Perhaps not; perhaps he just means that Johnson&rsquo;s enjoying the high of parliamentary debate, of being in the chamber, of being prime minister. But since the rest of the piece is about what disaster PMQs was for him, that seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Is this one of those open secrets that everyone in Westminster knows, including political journalists, but no-one reveals, because it&rsquo;s not the done thing, old chap?</p>
<p>I do hope not; but we should be told.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/09/02/on-devs/">On Devs</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/09/02/on-devs/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-09-03 00:59:44 &#43;0100">Sep 3, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just watched the last episode of <cite>Devs</cite>. Several friends recommended it after <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/08/08/150350/">I said &ldquo;What shall we watch next?&quot;</a> a few weeks ago. The question was intended rhetorically, but <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/1292101937811390464">they gave answers anyway</a>, which was nice.</p>
<p>In terms of its pacing, <cite>Devs</cite> was likened to Kubrick. Fair enough. I saw some Lynchian overtones in it. Or sub-Lynchian, anyway. I enjoyed the journey, but was slightly disappointed with the destination.</p>
<p>Not, however, as disappointed as I feared I was going to be halfway through the last episode. I practically cheered when Lily threw the gun away. But then poetry-quoting Stewart fucked everything up.</p>
<p>Of course, as soon as you (the programme maker) introduce simulations, you (the viewer) can no longer trust that anything is &ldquo;real,&rdquo; so everything gets slippery and to some extent, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>Where it disappoints, I think, is that Forest&rsquo;s incorrect determinism-based view was not actually overturned by the ending. We don&rsquo;t see him and Lily living in an alternative branch of the multiverse, but in a simulation that could be entirely consistent with his belief that reality proceeds on tram tracks &ndash; thereby obviating the guilt he feels for contributing to his wife and child&rsquo;s death, and also getting him off the hook in his mind for his complicity with his murderous ex-CIA security chief.</p>
<p>I found the first episode quite disturbing: the music was screechingly discordant and set my teeth on edge, and that creepy statue towered over everything. And the fact that the statue was still there, still creepy, at the end was confusing. Surely he&rsquo;d only had it built because his daughter died? But in the sim where his daughter survived, it was still there and the company was still named after her. Only Devs (or Deus) the project was missing. Which suggests that he had named the company and had the statue built, not as a commemoration of his daughter, but because &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know, really.</p>
<p>The other weird thing about the first episode was that, not having seen the cast, I spent the first ten minutes saying, &ldquo;Is that Ron Swanson?&rdquo; The fact that one of the first things he says was a complaint about government regulation feels like a clue. Nick Offerman does an impressive job of disappearing into the part, but he couldn&rsquo;t hide his voice.</p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;ll never be able to watch <cite>Parks &amp; Rec</cite> in the same way.</p>
<p>Also Katie, when explaining Devs to Lily, uses &ldquo;reason&rdquo; when she means &ldquo;cause.&rdquo; Her pushing the pen is the <em>cause</em> of it rolling across the table. The <em>reason</em> it happened is because she chose to push it. Reason (to me, at least) implies intelligence or at least sentience behind the action. Cause is the correct word to use when discussing <em>cause</em> and effect.</p>
<p>And when she asked Lily to name a truly random event, Lily should have said, &ldquo;Nuclear decay.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m reading Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s <cite>Orlando</cite> at the moment, and enjoying it very much. There&rsquo;s a bit right at the beginning, gruesomely involving a severed head, that I think Iain Banks might have been echoing in <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/08/12/the-algebraist-by-iain-m-banks-books-2018-19/"><cite>The Algebraist</cite></a> &ndash; considerably more gruesomely.</p>
<p>My bike ride this morning took me to Bloomsbury, Woolf&rsquo;s old area. On my way back, going through Islington, I thought of <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/08/01/walking-on-glass-by-iain-banks-books-2018-18/"><cite>Walking on Glass</cite></a>, and I suddenly realised that we have multiple characters walking around there with a lot going on in their heads, which is very similar to what happens in <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/02/mrs-dalloway-by-virginia-woolf-books-2018-25/"><cite>Mrs Dalloway</cite></a> &ndash; though in Central London</p>
<p>If you follow that link you&rsquo;ll see that I noted the stylistic connection between the two back in 2018, which I had forgotten today.</p>
<p>There have probably been theses written on such parallels.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> And Banks was an English graduate, after all, so he&rsquo;d surely have studied Woolf.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few months ago <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/09/website-changes/">I wrote that I had switched the way my blog was handled</a>. Not just the blog, the entire site, of which the blog has always been only a part. From being a WordPress blog, with a simple static front page, I moved to the whole site being statically generated: written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> and converted into HTML using a tool called <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>.</p>
<p>One of my reasons for doing that was to have control over the tools I use. If I chose one that was written in a language that I know, namely Python, then at the same time as changing my tools, I would have the chance to improve my knowledge of the language.</p>
<p>As you might expect, then, I&rsquo;ve made some contributions to the Nikola project. First I <a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Adevilgate+is%3Aclosed+">fixed a few minor bugs</a>. And now I&rsquo;ve created both a new theme and a new plugin.</p>
<h2 id="blogging-inspirations">Blogging Inspirations</h2>
<p>There are a couple of styles of blogging that have inspired both elements of my own networked writing, and the things I&rsquo;ve contributed. Those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &lsquo;link posts&rsquo; used by John Gruber of <a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> (and others, but I feel Gruber popularised them). In these, the post title becomes the link to the item the blogger is writing about. The blog post&rsquo;s own permalink is also present, but indicated by another element, such as the timestamp. On daring fireball it&rsquo;s the star after the title.</li>
<li>Titleless microblog posts, as popularised by Dave Winer at <a href="http://scripting.com">Scripting News</a>. Again, lots of other people do these too &ndash; not least many on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog </a> &ndash; but Winer was an early and is a continuing advocate.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to be able to use both of these techniques myself, and with only a small fix and some tweaks to template files, I could. But I also wanted to make them first-class citizens of my site, and to make them easily accessible for anyone else who use Nikola. So a theme that handled them well, and a plugin to ease their creation (well, creation of titleless posts) seemed like the way to go.</p>
<h2 id="the-gruberwine-theme">The GruberWine Theme</h2>
<p>Given the inspirations, I named my theme &lsquo;GruberWine&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s available in the <a href="https://themes.getnikola.com">Nikola theme repository</a>. The <a href="https://themes.getnikola.com/v8/gruberwine/">details are here</a>. It&rsquo;s based visually on another theme, called <a href="https://themes.getnikola.com/v8/zen-jinja/">zen-jinja</a>, but I made a lot of changes to the CSS.</p>
<h2 id="the-nikola-micro-plugin">The Nikola Micro Plugin</h2>
<p>Nikola provides a command-line tool for creating posts: <code>nikola new_post</code>. But that makes you enter a title. You can tweak things afterwards to remove the title, but if you know up front that your post won&rsquo;t have one, you can now use my &lsquo;Micro&rsquo; plugin, by running <code>nikola micro</code>. The <a href="https://plugins.getnikola.com/v8/micro/">details are here</a> in the <a href="https://plugins.getnikola.com">plugin repository</a>.</p>

It’s these moments when the web holds up to its original promise; the web standards, the infrastructure, the open web. With eyes wide open I watch as this beige suite of specifications link together until they’re like constellations out of stars in the sky. It all begin to makes sense. But it’s not just the technologies that fit together in these moments, it’s the skills, too. When I’m excited about design, and writing, and coding all at the same time, and when each of them can be seen as the same thing, just from different angles.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This short novel feels surprisingly modern. Indeed, maybe it&rsquo;s modern<em>ist</em>. It was written in the fifties, and is set in the thirties. The modern part is mainly the way it plays with time. Starting at a point and then flashing back is simple enough, but then we get various flashforwards and explanations of what&rsquo;s going to happen to the various characters. It&rsquo;s all very elegantly done, with the changes smoothly integrated, so they don&rsquo;t feel like jumps at all.</p>
<p>Jean Brodie is a teacher, and kind of an educational reformer, in that she thinks her students should be taught a broad array of things, and should learn about the world, rather than just follow a narrow, fixed curriculum. She would never &ldquo;teach to the test&rdquo; &ndash; which phrase is never used, but Brodie would be strongly against that modern malaise.</p>
<p>But she very much plays favourites. Her &ldquo;set&rdquo; get all her attention (outside of school as well as in it), and all the other pupils &ndash; those who have no chance of becoming &ldquo;la crème de la crème&rdquo; &ndash; are ignored. She is, ultimately, exceedingly self-centred.</p>
<p>Notoriously, she also has exceedingly dodgy &ndash; or maybe just deeply naive &ndash; political views. Here is Sandy, the main viewpoint character, when Brodie has shown the class a picture of Mussolini and his <em>fascisti</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They were dark as anything and all marching in the straightest of files, with their hands raised at the same angle, while Mussolini stood on a platform like a gym teacher or a Guides mistress and watched them. Mussolini had put an end to unemployment with his fascisti and there was no litter in the streets. It occurred to Sandy, there at the end of the Middle Meadow Walk, that the Brodie set was Miss Brodie’s fascisti, not to the naked eye, marching along, but all knit together for her need and in another way, marching along. That was all right, but it seemed, too, that Miss Brodie’s disapproval of the Girl Guides had jealousy in it, there was an inconsistency, a fault. Perhaps the Guides were too much a rival fascisti, and Miss Brodie could not bear it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gets worse, though, when she:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>was going abroad, not to Italy this year but to Germany, where Hitler was become Chancellor, a prophet-figure like Thomas Carlyle, and more reliable than Mussolini; the German brownshirts, she said, were exactly the same as the Italian black, only more reliable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She sees the error of her ways, though, after a fashion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the war Miss Brodie admitted to Sandy, as they sat in the Braid Hills Hotel, “Hitler <strong>was</strong> rather naughty.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She has some more positive views, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We of Edinburgh owe a lot to the French. We are Europeans.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*Sigh*</p>
<p>But my favourite quotes involve religion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lloyds were Catholics and so were made to have a lot of children by force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And getting back to those Fascisti:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By now she had entered the Catholic Church, in whose ranks she had found quite a number of Fascists much less agreeable than Miss Brodie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sad story, in the end. Worth reading, though.</p>

			 <p>Amused by <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/19.html#a154053">Dave Winer&rsquo;s comment</a>: &ldquo;can&rsquo;t stand podcasts with advertising.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m far from a lover of advertising, but podcast advertising is, to me the best kind. Or the least-bad kind, anyway. I use <a href="https://www.linode.com">Linode</a>, and <a href="https://textexpander.com">TextExpander</a>, and <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a>, and <a href="https://www.hover.com">Hover</a>&hellip; all because I first heard about them on podcasts (and/or because I got discounts on them from podcast ads).</p>
<p>But maybe that&rsquo;s a particular kind of podcast, or a particular kind of ad. They tend to be independents or small companies like <a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay FM</a>; ads that are read by the presenter, in their own voice &ndash; sometimes, though not always, in their own words. (Sometimes not their words, <a href="https://www.relay.fm/rocket">but weirded up</a>.)</p>
<p>Dave goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s even worse is podcasts with advertising with the proceeds going to charity. WTF goes through their minds. Why do they even bother.</p>
<p>&ndash; Dave Winer, <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/19.html#a154053">Untitled</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure what he&rsquo;s talking about there.</p>
<p>What I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> like is adverts that are injected separately from the body of the podcast. Another voice cuts in (or precedes, or concludes), talking about something irrelevant. Those ones are comparable with TV advertising, and I always skip them.</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="The Guardian to end print? - Flashes & Flames" data-author="" cite="https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/">
The Guardian, which has arguably become the world’s most sophisticated digital news operation, may be contemplating an end to its printed newspapers. That may have been signalled by the recent decision to cut 180 jobs (or 12% of its UK workforce) as a result of Covid.
<br />
...
<br />
But, tellingly, newsstand print sales, at £49.3m, were 50% down compared with 2016. Last year, print accounted for 42% of revenue (£94 million) and an estimated £75 million of production, distribution and marketing costs. So, the printed newspaper may last year have delivered almost £20m of real profit. But now Covid is pushing it into losses from which it may not be able to recover – without dramatic change.

<p>Interesting and unsurprising to learn that Saturday is (was?) its biggest day for print sales:</p>

Like most UK national newspapers, The Guardian has been highly profitable on Saturdays because of higher prices and sales volumes. Pre-Covid, The Guardian had been selling 100,000 copies at £2.20 on weeekdays. But, on a Saturday, it was selling 246,000 copies at £3.20 – and with more advertising revenue too.

<p>After <a href="/blog/2019/09/11/the-end-of-newspaper-delivery/">our local newsagent stopped delivering</a> the Saturday <cite>Guardian</cite>, we went out and bought it most weeks&hellip; until Covid and the lockdown. We haven&rsquo;t bought it since, probably, March. But we do pay online, as supporters and subscribers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d mind that much if it went digital-only, though it would be the end of an era. You&rsquo;d think they could keep just the Saturday edition, but:</p>
<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="The Guardian to end print? - Flashes & Flames" data-author="" cite="https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/">
The management may already have concluded that any plan to print a newspaper only on certain days (including the weekend) will not be viable. Much of the experience (especially of the Newhouse family’s Advance newspaper group in the US) seems to show that reducing the daily frequency seldom works: once the daily habit is broken, newspaper buyers quickly seem to stop buying the paper altogether. A consolation print option could be the expansion of the 101-year-old news magazine Guardian Weekly which claims readers in more than 170 countries.

</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d guess they&rsquo;ll maybe keep <cite>The Observer</cite> going for a while: Sunday papers have their own distinct identities.</p>
<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="The Guardian to end print? - Flashes & Flames" data-author="" cite="https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/">
The contrast with digital could not be greater. The Guardian has 160 million monthly uniques across the world, some 25% in the UK. More striking, though, are those digital editions in North America and Australia/New Zealand which, respectively, have advertising revenue of £25 million and £11 million. These are now strong operations, evidenced by Australia where The Guardian is the fourth largest online news service with an audience of 11.6 million (more than 50% of the adult population) – ahead of News Corp’s national daily, The Australian.

Harvard’s Nieman Journalism Lab describes The Guardian as “a weird newspaper” because: it has nearly two-thirds of its readers coming from outside its own country; started in one city and moved to another; and is owned by a trust that mandates it promotes liberal journalism in Britain and elsewhere.

			 <p>I got back on the bike today. First time since <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/07/the-last-bike-ride/">I came off back in April</a>. Both because I felt the need to add some variety to my exercise regime, and because <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/05/27/234242/">so many people are riding</a> these days. And also because I missed it.</p>
<p>It was good. Nice to be back on the bike. A bit annoying the way the mask makes your glasses steam up, but nothing that a bit of slipstream couldn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>But it was very disappointing regarding people&rsquo;s behaviour. I cycled around central Hackney for half an hour or so from about 9-9:30. It was pretty busy.</p>
<p>I counted 11 people wearing masks (and two chin-wearers, so they don&rsquo;t count). I must have passed about 500 people? 700? That&rsquo;s just a guess, but it was a lot.</p>
<p>Eleven masks.</p>
<p>My mask was protecting all of them: why weren&rsquo;t they protecting me, and each other?</p>
<p>I mainly blame the government, of course. Incoherent messaging and absence of care. But&hellip; <em>some</em> of us have learned what&rsquo;s best, even given the government.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My 2020 reading reaches 20, which is pleasing. And with another novella, which is something of a theme.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/02/25/sourdough-by-robin-sloan-books-2018-3/">read Sloan&rsquo;s <cite>Sourdough</cite> a couple of years back</a>, and only thought it was OK, but I still get his newsletter, which is where I learned about this. It was originally serialised in a San Francisco Bay Area newspaper,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and published via an <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/books/annabel-scheme-serial/">interesting experiment with online writing</a>, and a new <a href="http://github.com/robinsloan/perfect-edition">software package for publishing books on the web</a>.</p>
<p>That said, I read it on my Kindle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. Lots of fun, even if you don&rsquo;t know the Bay Area. A detective and her assistant try to stop multiple timelines being crashed together. But it starts with burritos. What&rsquo;s not to like?</p>
<p>One unusual thing is that the assistant, who is also the narrator (a veritable Doyle, though not as useful) never has any quoted speech. You&rsquo;ll get an exchange like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wondered if Scheme had worked up any theories.</p>
<p>“Sure. Most likely explanation is, Stella Pajunas was never real to start with. Ectoplasmic projection. Mass hallucination, maybe.”</p>
<p>Scheme was theorizing that the ABCD—really, the whole Bay Area—had been managed for ten years by a mass hallucination?</p>
<p>“It would explain some things, wouldn’t it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A piece of narration is answered by the other character. The implication is that the narrator said it. I don&rsquo;t recall ever seeing this in fiction, but it is used in some interviews. It used to be the norm in the <cite>NME</cite> back when I read it. In interviews, I much prefer that technique to the purely transcriptional approach, which can look like a play script at times. As to using it in fiction, it works well enough here, in such a short work, but I think it would get wearing at greater length.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can read it for free, so you might as well.</p>

			 <p>This has been sitting around in my drafts folder for about a month, so it&rsquo;s long past time to get it out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://hey.com">HEY</a> (they always capitalise it, which I don&rsquo;t care for) is a new email service from <a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, makers of fine (I’m told) collaboration software for teams. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI">The video walkthrough</a> lasts about half an hour, but/and gives you a good overview of what it’s like.</p>
<p>Hey was also in the news recently over the way Apple was treating it regarding App Store rules. Apple were clearly in the wrong, and things have been sorted out now.</p>
<p>But that’s all another story. I want to talk about Hey, and why I think it is bad for users. Even at the same time that it’s probably <em>good</em> for users. A company, a service, can — like a person — contain multitudes.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>If you watch that video you’ll see that Hey looks like an unusually interesting and capable email client: good for organising mail, getting the unimportant stuff out of your way until you want to look at it, and making the important things highly visible. It’s both powerful at automatically helping the user, and attractive to look at.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>But it’s built on a proprietary platform. Email’s biggest strength since its invention has been that it was built on open standards. Whether you were using a Unix command-line client at a university in the early days, or Gmail, Outlook, or another IMAP provider today — none of that matters. If you know someone’s email address, you can contact them, and they you. And more importantly for this discussion: if you want to use different email client software, you can.</p>
<p>That’s because email is built on <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Protocol">open protocols</a></em>: SMTP, POP, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">IMAP</a>. Not that you have to understand those &ndash; or even know about them &ndash; to use email, any more than you have to understand an internal combustion engine to drive a car.</p>
<p>More importantly, if you want to change from one email provider to another, you can do so. This is harder than it should be because the culture of people having their own domain never really caught on. All those <code>josmith1989@gmail.com</code> and <code>hazy_harriet@hotmail.com</code> type of addresses could, instead, have been <code>jo@josmith1989.net</code> and <code>harri@hazyharriet.org</code>.</p>
<p>They still could be, in fact. And when they are, then you can change the underlying email provider without anyone other than yourself having to know or care. To take a not-made-up example, <code>martin@devilgate.org</code> used to go by a complex combination of Gmail (for the spam filtering and search) and <code>5quidhost.co.uk</code> and its eventual purchaser, TSOHost, because that’s what I used for web hosting, as much as anything else. But a few years ago I switched it to <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>. No-one I correspond with had to know anything about the change.</p>
<p>But Hey’s email service does not use the open protocols — principally IMAP — that makes all that possible. Instead they have their own proprietary system. If you move your email into Hey’s service, you might not find it too easy to move it out again.</p>
<p>Secondly, right now they don’t support custom domains, so your correspondents will certainly have to know. While <code>josmith@hey.com</code> might be available right now, if they have any success we’ll soon be back to appending birth years or random numbers to the end of common names, just like on Gmail, Hotmail, etc. Though they have said they intend to support custom domains, so there’s scope for a better solution there.</p>
<h2 id="the-alternatives">The Alternatives</h2>
<p><a href="https://canion.me">Andrew Canion</a> had the same thought I did when I watched the video: you can do most of this in <a href="https://freron.com">MailMate</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> At least the viewing, the &lsquo;The Feed&rsquo; kind of thing. Though he had the added experience of using <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/">SaneBox</a> to automatically file and sort your emails.</p>
<p>Andrew also went further than I did: instead of just thinking, &lsquo;I could do that with MailMate,&rsquo; he went ahead and did it, and <a href="https://canion.blog/2020/06/16/replicating-heycom-features.html">documented the process</a> (with a <a href="https://canion.blog/2020/06/17/addendum-replicating-heycom.html">tiny bit of help from yours truly</a>).</p>
<p>I had heard of SaneBox through its sponsoring of various podcasts, so I was familiar with the idea, but I hadn’t tried it. I’m now trying it out, along with some of Andrew’s suggestions, and it’s altogether a pretty good setup. Now, all that comes into my main inbox — the only things that appear on unread counts, and hence activate icon badges — are actual emails that I want to see. All the newsletters, receipts, confirmations, and other stuff that isn’t spam but that I don’t want appearing in my inbox, and especially in my unread count — those are all there, but tidily away in other mailboxes, where I can deal with them at my leisure.</p>
<p>That said, SaneBox is not free (though it’s cheaper than Hey), and I don’t get <em>that</em> much annoying email. So I don’t think I’ll continue with this exact setup when the free trial ends. But it’s worth knowing that there are good ways — and standards-compliant ways — to achieve similar functionality to Hey’s.</p>
<h2 id="we-built-this-city-on-imap">We Built This City on IMAP</h2>
<p>What this all shows is that there’s nothing in Hey’s service that you couldn’t create by building on top of IMAP, except the user interface &ndash; and that doesn’t have to know about the underlying protocols in any case. It&rsquo;s possible that is exactly what they <em>have</em> done: implemented it on top of IMAP. In fact, doing anything else would mean giving themselves a lot of extra work, as they would have to effectively reinvent IMAP in any case.</p>
<p>If I were going to build a service like Hey, I’d start with an off-the-shelf IMAP service, probably open source, and build the filtering rules and all that around it.</p>
<p>So I hope that’s what they have done, and that at some point in the future they make their service available to ordinary email clients via IMAP.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I read about this in a <a href="https://www.tor.com/2020/07/02/jack-the-ripper-is-probably-the-sff-killer-youre-looking-for/">Tor.com article about the use of Jack the Ripper in fiction</a>. It&rsquo;s a story set in Victorian times, about two men living Baker Street in London; one a detective, the other a doctor.</p>
<p>But the detective is an angel, called Crow; and the doctor is JH Doyle, recently back from Afghanistan, where he was injured in an encounter with one of the Fallen. And someone is murdering women in Whitechapel.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s an interesting riff on the Sherlock Holmes stories. The hunt for the Ripper is spread through the whole book, while some of the well-known cases have versions interspersed. The Sign of the Four appears, Baskerville Hall is visited. When someone dies and the only visible wound is twin puncture marks, was it a snake, as in &lsquo;The Speckled Band,&rsquo; or a vampire?</p>
<p>Because most of the creatures of myth and legend exist in this London, often with an unusual twist. James Moriarty can&rsquo;t enter your home unless you invite him. But werewolves are respected landlords.</p>
<p>Vampires can enter public buildings, of course: &ldquo;Any building with an angel.&rdquo; Angels only have consciousness and names &ndash; names are important &ndash; if they are attached to a public building. Churches and synagogues have their angels, obviously; but so too do pubs, hotels, and stations. The angel of King&rsquo;s Cross makes an appearance.</p>
<p>But not the angel I was half expecting. The Angel, Islington is a pub,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and we&rsquo;d have to refer to its angel as &lsquo;The Angel of the Angel, Islington,&rsquo; which would be weird and unwieldy.</p>
<p>Speaking of language, the Victorianism is handled pretty well, I think, but the author is American, and it shows where a few terms creep in. &lsquo;Sidewalk&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;pavement&rsquo;; &lsquo;baseboard&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;skirting board.&rsquo; &lsquo;Row houses&rsquo; where we would say &lsquo;terraced houses.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sundown.&rsquo; &lsquo;Paper folded into fourths&rsquo;; a British writer would say &lsquo;quarters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These are mildly jarring, but not that important. Certainly not enough to detract from the fun of the story overall.</p>

<p>The intelligence finding was briefed to President Trump, and the White House’s National Security Council discussed the problem at an interagency meeting in late March, the officials said. Officials developed a menu of potential options — starting with making a diplomatic complaint to Moscow and a demand that it stop, along with an escalating series of sanctions and other possible responses, but the White House has yet to authorize any step, the officials said.</p>

			 <p>This has won all the awards, and rightly so. Or not quite all: it&rsquo;s a finalist for the Hugo novella award. At the time of writing, we don&rsquo;t know whether or not it will win.</p>
<p>Unless I&rsquo;ve travelled downthread and found out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a novella, which may be the perfect length of story, in some sense. It&rsquo;s a love story across time and space and multiple parallel existences&hellip; It&rsquo;s pure dead brilliant.</p>
<p>The actual nature of the war, of the sides, even of the protagonists, Red and Blue, is ambiguous at best. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter because the writing is so exquisite.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_How_You_Lose_the_Time_War">Wikipedia article</a> describes it as an epistolary novel. That&rsquo;s only partly true, and not just because it&rsquo;s a novella. The letters are there, and are fundamental, but I feel that to be truly &lsquo;epistolary,&rsquo; the whole story must be told in letters, and that is not the case here. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>One minor oddity I alluded to above: The future is referred to as &lsquo;downthread&rsquo; and the past &lsquo;upthread.&rsquo; That seems the wrong way round to me, but maybe it reflects the fact that, normally, we can&rsquo;t stop sliding down into the future.</p>
<p>Go. Get. Read. VVG. They&rsquo;re adapting it for TV. I can&rsquo;t quite imagine what that will look like, but I&rsquo;m keen to find out.</p>

			 <p>Friday Baldwin is genetically engineered &lsquo;artificial person.&rsquo; Indistinguishable from a conventional human, she nonetheless is psychologically constrained by the way her society discriminates against her type.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much her only constraint, though. Her engineered nature also gives her enhanced strength, reflexes, sight, hearing, and smell, as well as genius-level intelligence. She starts out as a courier and soon becomes a fugitive.</p>
<p>This stands up pretty well, all these years since I first read it. The fragmented, Balkanised future North America is interesting. Easy travel everywhere by &lsquo;tubes,&rsquo; which are presumably underground trains, and suborbital rockets. Corruption so pervasive that the characters don&rsquo;t even notice it.

			 <h2 id="quiet-thoughts">Quiet Thoughts</h2>
<p><a href="https://colinwalker.blog/15-06-2020-1528/">Colin Walker links</a> to a <a href="https://jusummerhayes.livejournal.com/655972.html">post by Julian Summerhayes</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> about silence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see, I&rsquo;m missing the silence of early lockdown.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m really missing it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say everything&rsquo;s back to normal but as soon as I step outside, BOOM, there it is! That infernal, torrid background noise, cars everywhere (the air smells dirty) and it&rsquo;s like nothing ever happened.</p>
<p>&ndash; Julian Summerhayes, <a href="https://jusummerhayes.livejournal.com/655972.html">A quiet space</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can relate. I haven&rsquo;t noticed the increased noise yet, but I have been enjoying much about lockdown, and the general quietness of things, especially when I sit out in the garden, is part of that. As is the cleaner air here in London.</p>
<h2 id="unthinkable-thoughts">Unthinkable Thoughts</h2>
<p>But Julian goes on to say something that just seems so bizarre, so alien to me, that I can scarcely comprehend it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when you realise that <strong>you&rsquo;re not your thoughts</strong>, notwithstanding the apparent hold they have over us, and see that they flow naturally much like my beloved River Dart and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to orientate them one way or the other, life becomes a lot easier.</p>
<p>&ndash; Julian Summerhayes, <a href="https://jusummerhayes.livejournal.com/655972.html">A quiet space</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis very much mine. We are not our thoughts? I can&rsquo;t help but think that there&rsquo;s a missing pair of words in that sentence: &lsquo;nothing if&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; you&rsquo;re nothing if not your thoughts&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that makes a lot more sense to me. If we are not our thoughts, then what are we? If our thoughts are not us, then who is doing the thinking?</p>
<p>People sometimes use phrasing like, &lsquo;My brain told me to&hellip;&rsquo;, which raises the same question: you <em>are</em> your brain, surely? If not, then what? We are our whole bodies, certainly, and perception and experience encompass all of our physiology, not <em>just</em> our brains. But the brain is the seat of consciousness, and we are conscious beings.</p>
<p>Perhaps &ndash; just possibly &ndash; people are making a distinction between brain and mind. Maybe that would make sense for the latter formulation, but I&rsquo;m not convinced that&rsquo;s it. And certainly it doesn&rsquo;t explain Julian&rsquo;s concept of <em>thoughts</em>. Because whether thoughts happen in the physical organ we call <em>brain</em>, or the somewhat more metaphysical and amorphous <em>mind</em>: thoughts are what we <em>are</em>.</p>
<h2 id="in-other-heads">In Other Heads</h2>
<p>Or so it seems to me. But I shouldn&rsquo;t dismiss alternative perceptions. Over the last few months I&rsquo;ve heard several conversations on podcasts, and read a couple of articles, about the different ways people&rsquo;s brains/minds/psyches/consciousnesses work.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia">aphantasia</a>, which names the fact that some people do not form images in their minds. They have no &lsquo;mind&rsquo;s eye,&rsquo; in effect. Just yesterday I read <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-purpose.html">an article about it and severely deficient autobiographical memory</a>, or SDAM, which seems to be related.</p>
<p>There has also been talk about whether or not we think in words. That can get confusing when people with different experiences discuss &lsquo;the voice in your head.&rsquo; One will ask something like, &lsquo;Whose voice is it?&rsquo; The answer &ndash; from my perspective &ndash; is that the voice in my head <em>is</em> my thoughts. That&rsquo;s how I think. Hmm, except when I think in pictures, as I&rsquo;m not aphantasic (aphantastic?)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to talk about these ideas in ways that someone whose experience is dramatically different will understand. And I find it surprising that we <em>are</em> so different. I wonder if we are just hitting the limitations of language (of English, at least). Maybe people&rsquo;s experiences are not <em>that</em> different, but it&rsquo;s just so hard to describe what goes on inside your own head in a way that is meaningful inside someone else&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Or not. After all, some people <em>do</em> hear voices in their heads which appear not to be their own. We generally categorise those people as having a mental illness, and sometimes medication changes their mental experience. And of course psychoactive drugs cause us to have experiences in our own heads that are different from our normal state, so it&rsquo;s clear that thoughts and perceptions are at least partly chemical.</p>
<p>This is all both fascinating and confusing, and I have no conclusions about it.</p>

			 <p>I should probably start a special tag for all this Heinlein rereading I&rsquo;m doing (I	 have another one in progress). These books are so short that they hardly count as one novel <em>between</em> them, never mind each, but I&rsquo;m counting them as two because I have two physically separate books.</p>
<p>Plus they&rsquo;re not only not one novel, they&rsquo;re not even two. They are, in fact, four stories &ndash; the longest no more than a novella &ndash; loosely connected by the idea that humans don&rsquo;t use all of their brain power, and we could do incredible things if we did.</p>
<p>Oh, and an early analysis of what it is to be human, and whether human rights should be accorded to uplifted intelligent animals.</p>
<p>All in all, a good enough, if slight, set of stories.</p>

			 <p>A set of linked short stories, this, all part of Heinlein&rsquo;s Future History. In these days of companies launching rockets to the International Space Station, the title story seems slightly relevant. In it, businessman DD Harriman attempts to launch the first mission to the moon &ndash; it was written in the 40s, long before Apollo.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all decent enough stories. But we are in a very masculine world. The dodgy sexual politics of <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/05/31/beyond-this-horizon-by-robert-a-heinlein-books-2020-10/">the last one</a> are largely ignored by the almost complete absence of women. Except in &lsquo;Let There Be Light,&rsquo; in which a women is effectively co-inventor of solar power panels.</p>
<p>Heinlein&rsquo;s writing of women characters is generally considered to be poor, and I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s true. But it&rsquo;s interesting to think how he developed from these early stories to the later novels, where at least there <em>are</em> women, and they are major characters.</p>

<p>Why didn&rsquo;t I go? To be honest, it&rsquo;s because I was scared. Not of the demo, or anything that might have happened there. I was scared of the virus. Of the close contact that was sure to happen.</p>
<p>I gave her a lift to her friend&rsquo;s house. They walked for two and a half hours to Hyde Park. I picked her up in Camden afterwards. But part of me wishes I&rsquo;d gone myself.

			 <p>I like these short books you can read in a day.</p>
<p>A reread, of course. I read most or all of Heinlein from my early days of reading SF. But I read the blurb on the back of this and didn&rsquo;t recognise it at all. Started reading, and it still wasn&rsquo;t familiar.</p>
<p>Then as I got closer to the end, it <em>did</em> start to seem familiar. Did I read the last quarter of it recently? Or is there a short-story version of part of it that I read not long ago? I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s often strange how memory works.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first point about this: the sexual politics are <em>horrific</em>. It&rsquo;s a future society where men go armed routinely &ndash; and so it is a &lsquo;polite&rsquo; society. It may be where the phrase &lsquo;an armed society is a polite society&rsquo; comes from. I wonder what Heinlein (assuming that to be his actual view) would think of today&rsquo;s armed society in America.</p>
<p>Women, on the other hand, do <em>not</em> go armed, or do much else apart from be decorative and have babies. Mostly. One woman character wears a sidearm, but the protagonist does not exactly treat her with the respect he gives to other men.</p>
<p>Men can choose not to go armed, in which case they have to wear the &lsquo;Brassard of peace,&rsquo; and are treated as second-class citizens by the armed &lsquo;braves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not mainly about any of that. It&rsquo;s about eugenics, and how and whether it&rsquo;s possible to improve the human race ethically.</p>
<p>In story terms it&rsquo;s OK. It&rsquo;s interesting enough that you want to know what happens, but it feels like its main purpose in existing is to examine the philosophical questions around eugenics. I note that it was published in 1942, so before the Nazis' experiments were known about.</p>

			 <p>The last Brookmyre I read was <cite>Pandaemonium</cite>, <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2010/09/08/summer-reading-2010/">in 2010</a>. Before that, his first, <cite>Quite Ugly One Morning</cite>, before I started writing here. The second of those introduced campaigning journalist Jack Parlabane. There&rsquo;s another one before this, but you don&rsquo;t need to read them in order. There are also a stack more.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Anyway, what&rsquo;s it like? No bad, as we say in Scotland. It starts off with Parlabane in prison. Part of the story, including how he ended up there, is told in flashback. It&rsquo;s all set in the early days of the new Scottish Parliament, around 2000, 2001.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a decent page turner, I can&rsquo;t deny. My main criticism in writerly terms is about the old &lsquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell,&rsquo; thing, which we&rsquo;ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2011/06/09/tell-and-maybe-show-as-well/">discussed</a> here <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2015/10/06/the-three-body-problem-by-cixin-liu-translated-by-ken-liu-books-2015-9/">before</a>.</p>
<p>In at least one of those pieces I counsel against setting that injunction in stone. But it&rsquo;s notable how much of this novel violates or ignores it. For large chunks of the flashbacks we&rsquo;re told what happens. It&rsquo;s fine. The writing style flows and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like infodumps, but I was certainly aware of it.</p>
<p>Worth reading. I&rsquo;ll probably read more of him, eventually. Still looking for a sequel to <cite>Pandaemonium</cite>, though.</p>

			 <p>Dr John Lee, writing in <cite>The Spectator</cite> (paywall, but free access to a few articles), explains what pathologists do, and goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are still struggling to understand coronavirus. I can think of no time in my medical career when it has been more important to have accurate diagnosis of a disease, and understanding of precisely why patients have died of it. Yet very early on in the epidemic, rules surrounding death certification were changed — in ways that make the statistics unreliable.</p>
<p>&ndash; Dr John Lee, <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-way-covid-deaths-are-being-counted-is-a-national-scandal">The way ‘Covid deaths’ are being counted is a national scandal</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve moved from needing two doctors to certify death, to only one <em>if the cause is believed to be Covid-19</em>. And sometimes the &lsquo;cause&rsquo; is decided from a statement from care-home staff, who are not usually trained medical professionals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So at a time when accurate death statistics are more important than ever, the rules have been changed in ways that make them less reliable than ever. In what proportion of Covid-19 ‘mentions’ was the disease actually present? And in how many cases, if actually present, was Covid-19 responsible for death? Despite what you may have understood from the daily briefings, the shocking truth is that we just don’t know. How many of the excess deaths during the epidemic are due to Covid-19, and how many are due to our societal responses of healthcare reorganisation, lockdown and social distancing? Again, we don’t know. Despite claims that they’re all due to Covid-19, there’s strong evidence that many, perhaps even a majority, are the result of our responses rather than the disease itself.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It sometimes seems like we&rsquo;re trying, as a country, to handle this whole thing as badly as possible.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I decided I needed something SF-y that I knew I&rsquo;d enjoy: a reread, in other words. Something with spaceships. Prowling my shelves, this is what I came to. No spaceships, but fast skateboards and faster motorbikes, katanas and glass knives; and of course, the Metaverse.</p>
<p>I was struck by how little of it I remembered, but it is something like 26 years since I read it (published 1992, so I&rsquo;m guessing I read it in 94 or so).</p>
<p>Hiro Protagonist, the fantastically-named hero, is a hacker.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> He&rsquo;s also the greatest samurai swordsman alive, supposedly. And he&rsquo;s delivering pizzas for the Mafia. Which fact is the first view we have of how the world &ndash; or at least America &ndash; has changed. There is almost no government, no laws; and everything is split up into &lsquo;burbclaves&rsquo; and franchises, run by companies, churches, or criminal organisations.</p>
<p>But there is the Metaverse. Nothing we have today is close to what it is like, but it&rsquo;s what virtual reality wants to be, and maybe will be one day.</p>
<p>The internet is everywhere (which of course wasn&rsquo;t the case when it was written). Though phoneboxes still exist, and using them is one way to get into the Metaverse. And if you want mobile access, you have to &lsquo;go gargoyle.&rsquo; Which is to say, wear your special goggles and carry a computer around with you, strapped to your body. There are mobile phones, but the conversion of them into pocket computers is <em>not</em> something that Stephenson foresaw. Or at least, not something he made use of here.</p>
<h2 id="the-ending">The Ending</h2>
<p>I had the impression that everyone thought that early Stephenson had problems with endings. I mean, I had that impression myself, and <a href="/blog/2007/01/21/book-notes-23-quicksilver-by-neal-stephenson/">have alluded to it here before</a>. And I thought that this was one with a slightly weak ending.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t at all. The bit that I remembered &ndash; the climax that takes place in the Metaverse &ndash; comes at the end of a tense chase/fight sequence, and while it depicts a scene that might be anticlimactic for the people in-universe who witness it, it&rsquo;s fully satisfying and sound to us, the readers. Then the last couple of chapters wind things up neatly back in the outer world.</p>
<p>The criticism that might be levelled at it, especially in SF terms, is that we don&rsquo;t see how the world has been changed by the events of the story. But I think that can easily be left to our imaginations.</p>
<p>A genuine classic.</p>

<p>In case you don&rsquo;t know, Wakefield is married to Dominic Cummings. She works for <cite>The Spectator</cite>, and wrote the now-famous piece about her and Cummings&rsquo;s experience suffering from Covid-19. All without mentioning their drive across the country.</p>
<p>Hence the delightful opening &ndash; now removed, predictably &ndash; in Wikipedia, describing her as &ldquo;a lying sack of potatoes&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>Sad to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/19/astrid-kerchherr-photographer-the-beatles?utm_term=RWRpdG9yaWFsX1NsZWV2ZU5vdGVzLTIwMDUyMg%3D%3D&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=sleevenotes_email&amp;utm_campaign=SleeveNotes">read in <cite>The Guardian</cite></a> that Astrid Kirchherr<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> has died. She was 81. That&rsquo;s not a bad age, and it&rsquo;s not like I had followed her career. I just knew her as a photographer who had worked with The Beatles, and been Stuart Sutcliffe&rsquo;s partner till he died.</p>
<p>But from my early reading of Beatles books &ndash; like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_An_Illustrated_Record"><cite>The Beatles: An Illustrated Record</cite></a> &ndash; onward, I was aware of her as part of their story, their mythology.</p>
<p>More than that, though, as the article above, as well as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/17/astrid-kirchherr-obituary">her obituary</a>, will tell you: she was the one who gave them their early look. She made them the &ldquo;lovable moptops.&rdquo; They&rsquo;d have been successful without the haircuts, of course, but there&rsquo;s no denying the importance of that early image.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m saddened more because of what her death represents. I was born the year The Beatles took America. They had long split up by the time I developed any musical awareness.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But they were the first band I really got interested in, when my sister gave me a tape. They were my favourites until punk came along, and I love them still.</p>
<p>But that whole generation is ageing &ndash; well, who isn&rsquo;t, of course &ndash; and will soon be gone. And mine not too far behind it. So what it all comes down to is that Astrid&rsquo;s death reminds me of my own mortality, and there&rsquo;s no excuse for that!</p>

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/05/19/tip-how-to-snooze-iphone/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-05-19 10:49:28 &#43;0100">May 19, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I don&rsquo;t know whether people know about this iOS feature. I discovered it by accident a year or two back. Before that I used to snooze my alarms by drowsily scrabbling for my phone, prying my eyes open, then trying to tap the correct onscreen button.</p>
<p>Then one morning the alarm was too loud &ndash; or it might have been too quiet, I don&rsquo;t recall &ndash; and I tried to change the volume. When I pressed the volume button, the alarm instantly stopped. I thought I had cancelled it by accident, until it rang again the customary nine minutes later.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve always snoozed my alarms that way. But nearly every time I do, I think, &ldquo;Do people know about this feature?&rdquo; Because I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen it written down. And I&rsquo;m going to post this without DuckDucking first, so that the existence of some article in The Verge or somewhere doesn&rsquo;t spoil my flow.</p>
<p>I had thought that pressing the power button cancelled the alarm, rather than snoozing it, but I just checked, and it <em>also</em> snoozes it. So if you reach out, eyes closed, and press <em>anything</em> on the side of your iPhone, you&rsquo;ll get another nine minutes.</p>
<p>In the interest of fully informing you, dear reader, I&rsquo;ve just checked what the Home button does; and it appears that <em>does</em> cancel the alarm. So keep your presses to the sides.</p>
<p>I should note that I <a href="/blog/2017/07/11/great-new-phone-all-the-wrong-reasons/">still</a> have an iPhone 7. I&rsquo;ve no reason to believe the behaviour is significantly different on more recent models, but obviously on the 10-series phones (X, XR, XS and the various 11s) you don&rsquo;t have the Home button, so something different might happen. Let me know if you find out.</p>

			 <p>Sad to hear of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/04/stranglers-keyboardist-dave-greenfield-dies-after-contracting-covid-19">death of Dave Greenfield</a> from Covid-19. The Stranglers were not really like other punk bands. But they were the band that got me into punk. I heard &lsquo;No More Heroes&rsquo; on the radio one weekend, after hearing my school friends talk about punk, and I never really looked back.</p>
<p>I never saw them live, and I didn&rsquo;t follow their career after the first three or four albums; but there&rsquo;s a lot of good stuff in those early ones.</p>
<p>Greenfield is, I think, the first musician of that generation to die from the pandemic.</p>

			 <p>This is Richard Ayoade’s detailed analysis of the 2003 film <cite>View From the Top</cite>, directed by Bruno Barreto and starring Gwyneth Paltrow. It is, by all accounts, a masterwork.</p>
<p>By Ayoade’s account, at least. I haven’t seen it. Ayoade is a comedian. The book is pretty funny. The film, I suspect, is quite bad.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m almost beginning to wish I hadn&rsquo;t switched my site to static generation. Not really, though. I&rsquo;m very pleased with the way the site is performing, with how it looks, and with how easy it is to change things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the <em>non</em>-static parts that I want to get working that are complex. By which I mean comments, of course, and Webmentions.</p>
<p>Comments are obvious. And the &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; way to make them work with a static site &ndash; and one that has good support built into <a href="https://getnikola.com">Nikola</a>, the generator application I&rsquo;m using &ndash; is <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. But Disqus is known to track its users and show ads, and I don&rsquo;t want that for anyone who might comment here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been trying other options. But none of them work as easily as you&rsquo;d hope. There are always complexities, difficulties, bits you have to glue together or even build yourself.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve tried:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://posativ.org/isso/">Isso</a>: you have to run a service on your site. I couldn&rsquo;t get the service to respond.</li>
<li><a href="https://staticman.net/">Staticman</a>: I couldn&rsquo;t get its service to start. A problem with configuring the private key setting.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.remarkbox.com/">Remarkbox</a>: at the time of writing this is still active, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll keep it. It works like Disqus, in that the comments are hosted on a third-party site, which is not really in keeping with the whole static site/indieweb ethos. It&rsquo;s not advertising driven like Disqus, but it behaves a bit strangely, at least on here. We&rsquo;ll see, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of blogs manage without comments, of course, including many of the most successful and long-running ones. But I&rsquo;ve always had a fondness for them. They were building communities online long before there was a Facebook or a Twitter.</p>
<p>The other way to join the conversation is to send and accept <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmentions</a>. I won&rsquo;t try to explain those here, but again, there&rsquo;s a certain amount of infrastructure needed to get them working, and I&rsquo;m not quite there yet.</p>
<p>Still, it all means I&rsquo;m learning things, which is good. And my posts and pages are just text files, which is as they should be.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s good when you can repair things. We had a problem with the switch on the kettle the other day, and I was able to open it up, put various bits back in place, and get it working again. It tripped not one but <em>three</em> circuit breakers in the house <em>and</em> blew the fuse in its plug, all while it was failing, but that&rsquo;s what safety devices are for, I guess.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;ve just fixed the switch on our hoover. Actually it&rsquo;s a Miele, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wDyUF8Y-As">this video</a> by an Australian repair person was really helpful. He&rsquo;s dealing with a different model, but it&rsquo;s the same problem &ndash; the switch wouldn&rsquo;t stay on &ndash; and the same construction and even part number.</p>
<p>I was able to get the footswitch off following what he did, and order a replacement part online. It arrived today, and all went back together really smoothly, and now our <del>hoover</del> Miele vacuum cleaner<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is working again.</p>
<p>Oddly the part number on the replacement is different from that on the broken one, which matched the number the video guy quotes.</p>
<p>Anyway, while I&rsquo;d have tried these repairs under normal circumstances, it&rsquo;s especially useful at the moment, when it&rsquo;s not like you can go shopping, or get someone to come in and fix things.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve never read Greene before, except for I think one short story, and a chapter or two of his autobiography. This is fascinating. It&rsquo;s the story of a Catholic priest in Mexico at a time when the church was banned. I had no idea that such a time existed: I think of Mexico as a very Catholic country, so such oppression is surprising.</p>
<p>The genius of it is that all the characters are so convincing. From the &ldquo;whisky priest&rdquo; himself &ndash; sinful, still believing, considering himself damned, yet trying to do what he can for people he feels are his parishioners; through to the hardline atheist lieutenant of police that is trying to find him. No-one is entirely good or bad, but there is sympathy for them all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s justly considered a classic.</p>

			 <p>Out to the supermarket today, because we were running low on a few things and our next delivery isn&rsquo;t arriving till Monday. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve been out &ndash; except to the back garden &ndash; since the <a href="/blog/2020/04/07/the-last-bike-ride/">bike incident</a>. Admittedly that was only four days ago, but like everything now, it feels a lot longer.</p>
<p>And I felt some trepidation about it. The world&rsquo;s a dangerous place: the very <em>air</em> is dangerous, depending on who you get close to. And some you can&rsquo;t avoid, because pavements have a finite width, and some people <em>still</em> walk blithely two-abreast, or on their own but down the middle&hellip; honestly, people, keep your distance.</p>
<p>In keeping with my <a href="/blog/2020/04/02/wear-a-mask-and-celebrate-your-immune-system/">recent exhortation</a>, I wore a mask. Just a bandana, but as I said there, anything is better than nothing. And hey, it reminded me of The Clash in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ttJBdr6eBuo">&ldquo;Bankrobber&rdquo; video</a>.</p>
<p>Sainsbury&rsquo;s was fine. A spaced-out queue of about ten people outside, one-in-one-out, and maybe only five people in the shop at once (it&rsquo;s one of the small Sainsbury branches, I should note). All very well handled</p>
<p>People with and without masks &ndash; some kind of face covering, at least &ndash; I&rsquo;d estimate at around 30/70. Some with were also wearing gloves and looking very overheated.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a feeling of society &ndash; there already, and that I think might grow &ndash; when you&rsquo;re masked: you see someone who isn&rsquo;t, you shy away; while when you see another mask wearer you make eye contact. A small nod passes between you: we&rsquo;re different. We&rsquo;re connected. We&rsquo;re doing something they&rsquo;re not. Or maybe just, we have the same fears.</p>
<p>On the way back I passed a bus stop, where the only person waiting was an NHS worker on her way to a shift at Homerton Hospital (I assume, because that&rsquo;s where the bus goes). A month ago I&rsquo;d have wondered why people wear their staff passes outside of their work. Today it&rsquo;s a badge of honour.</p>

			 <h2 id="abstracttldr">Abstract/TL;DR</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m changing my site. Everything should go on working, but comments will disappear for a while.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m changing both the server my site runs on, and the way it&rsquo;s built. I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> for the blog since I started it in 2006 (before that I used <a href="https://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a>, and at some point I imported those posts, so the earliest entries go back to 2002). Just recently, though, I started having a problem with it.</p>
<p>Everything was still running OK, but I couldn&rsquo;t post to it from external sources. So I couldn&rsquo;t use <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, which is my preferred way to post, or the <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> app for status updates, or even services like <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>, which has been adding notes and ratings for all the films I&rsquo;ve watched over the last few months, from <a href="https://letterboxd.com/devilgate/films/diary/">Letterboxd</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I could have tracked down the cause and fixed it. But then there&rsquo;s also the fact that I recently got round to upgrading to WordPress 5<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I had avoided that because I didn&rsquo;t like the new editor <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/09/02/4985/">when I tried it out before</a>. I don&rsquo;t know quite why, but eventually I bit the bullet and upgraded.</p>
<p>And I hate it. I never really cared for the online editing experience at the best of times, which is part of the reason I preferred using MarsEdit. But I just have a visceral bad reaction to the new editor.</p>
<p>Add to that that static sites are a) much faster to serve and b) what &ldquo;all the cool kids&rdquo; are using nowadays. I started to look into moving to a static site.</p>
<p>The two big players here are Jekyll and Hugo. I&rsquo;ve used Jekyll before, when I was at SAHSU. The <a href="https://smallareahealthstatisticsunit.github.io/rapidInquiryFacility/">documentation for the RIF</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> is hosted at GitHub Pages, and that uses Jekyll, so it&rsquo;s worth having a local implementation for testing, which I did.</p>
<p>But as a programmer, there can be times when you want to change the tools you use. Jekyll is written in Ruby; Hugo is in Go. I don&rsquo;t know either of those, and while I like learning new languages, that wasn&rsquo;t the purpose of this exercise.</p>
<p>In short, I wanted something that is written in Python, and I found it in <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> For reasons too boring to explain, I had trouble with it on my existing server, so I&rsquo;ve set up a new one at <a href="https://www.linode.com">Linode</a>. I&rsquo;ll be switching over to it later today. You shouldn&rsquo;t see any changes, except:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the comments on the blog will disappear. They&rsquo;re not lost, and I plan to get them back, but I need to find the best way to do that. For now, comment via Twitter or Micro.blog.</li>
<li>The Atom feed may be broken. I&rsquo;ll try to get that fixed. The RSS feed should still be fine, and at the same location as before. Anything that uses it should carry on working without any fuss.</li>
<li>If you follow me via WordPress.com (Hi Andrew), sorry. That&rsquo;s going away. Try my <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/feed">RSS feed</a> instead. Or Twitter; all posts automatically get Tweeted to <a href="https://github.com/devilgate">my timeline</a>.</li>

			 <p>I came off my bike today. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not hurt, beyond a couple of scrapes. But as I was going down &ndash; you know how people say things go into slow motion? It wasn&rsquo;t quite like that, but I did have time to think, &ldquo;Shit, I hope they don&rsquo;t have to call an ambulance.&rdquo; And once I was down and realised that nothing was broken, I thought, &ldquo;I hope no-one comes running to help, cos I&rsquo;ll have to wave them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No-one came to help, of course &ndash; mainly because there was no-one around. But all this is ironic, given that I read a piece a week or so back by a keen cyclist, saying he wanted to ride, but wasn&rsquo;t going to, because if he got hurt then he&rsquo;d be taking much-needed resources from the NHS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very noble,&rdquo; I thought, and then proceeded to completely ignore the implied advice.</p>
<p>No longer. From now until this is over, I&rsquo;ll be exercising indoors, or at most, in the garden. It&rsquo;s a shame, because I do love to get out on the bike, especially in the spring. But everyone has to put up with limitations during this, and this is a pretty minor one.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2287/">Yesterday’s XKCD</a> “Pathogen Resistance” turns things round and shows the current crisis from the point of view of the virus. It is genius. And even has a <cite>Watchmen</cite> reference in the mouseover text.<sup id="fnref-6473-Rorschach"><a href="#fn-6473-Rorschach" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But more importantly, and unrelated: it turns out that <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/23/face-masks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">wearing a mask — any kind, even just a scarf</a>– will help to reduce the spread of the virus. This is contrary to what we were told initially, but it makes complete sense even without technical analysis. <em>Anything</em> coming between someone else’s droplets and your lungs, or your droplets and someone else’s lungs, is better than <em>nothing</em> coming between them.</p>
<p>It’s like wearing a cycling helmet: I’ve always thought that something between my head and the ground, should I come off, is better than nothing.</p>
<p>And there are <a href="https://ragmask.com">designs online for making masks</a> out of any old cloth. I feel <em>#blessed</em> that my daughter has an A-level in textiles and a sewing machine.</p>
<p>On the question of masks, though, something has been confusing me since this all started. And to an extent, before that, really, when I’d occasionally see people out and about wearing what appeared to be a hospital-style mask. Which is, where did people get such things? How did they come to have what looked like professional medical supplies in their private possession? Aren’t these things <em>controlled</em>?</p>
<p>Clearly not, for the last one. And I wondered <em>why</em>? Why did people have them? Now, that seems like a foolish question. And it ignores the cultural differences, whereby in parts of Asia it’s considered rude not to wear a mask if you are sick. Makes sense, though I always wonder how horrible it is if you sneeze while wearing one.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I like this quote from near the end:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The fact that we don’t know what’s going to happen in the future is a terrible mistake in the programming of the world. It should be fixed at the first opportunity.
</p></blockquote>
<p>When I read Tokarczuk’s <cite>Flights</cite> at the <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/01/15/flights-by-olga-tokarczuk-books-2019-1/">start of last year</a>, it was actually this one that had led me to her. Warren Ellis recommended it in his newsletter, if I remember correctly, and the title intrigued me. What I didn’t realise then was that the title is a quote from William Blake: “Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead,” he says, in <a href="http://www.interglacial.com/~sburke/pub/prose/Blake_-_Proverbs_of_Hell.html"><cite>Proverbs of Hell</cite></a>. With that spelling, I note.</p>
<p>Apparently it caused a great fuss when it was published in Poland. I don’t understand why, but cultures are different.</p>
<p>Unlike <cite>Flights</cite>, it’s a complete, single story. It’s also much simpler. The narrator is an interesting character, though her practice of astrology adds nothing to the story and gets in its way to an extent.</p>
<p>Each chapter has a quote from Blake as an epigraph. I don’t think she used the thirteenth proverb of hell, though it could be seen as the narrator’s north star:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  All wholesome food is caught without a net or a trap.

We don't see anything of their lives outside of their financial dealings, so it fails to humanise them sufficiently. As characters, I ended up just finding them tiresome.</p><p>To really help us to understand the whole thing, it would need to be a documentary, and that would have been harder to sell.

<blockquote><p>
  Any child growing up in Canada in the 1940s, at a time before there were vaccines for a horde of deadly diseases, was familiar with quarantine signs. They were yellow and they appeared on the front doors of houses. They said things such as DIPHTHERIA and SCARLET FEVER and WHOOPING COUGH. Milkmen – there were still milkmen in those years, sometimes with horse-drawn wagons – and bread men, ditto, and even icemen, and certainly postmen (and yes, they were all men), had to leave things on the front doorsteps. We kids would stand outside in the snow – for me, it was always winter in cities, as the rest of the time my family was up in the woods – gazing at the mysterious signs and wondering what gruesome things were going on inside the houses. Children were especially susceptible to these diseases, especially diptheria – I had four little cousins who died of it – so once in a while a classmate would disappear, sometimes to return, sometimes not.

<p>In considering how rich families try to control who their progeny marry, I found it interesting to see if this mapped on to <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite> at all. Only if if you stretch things quite a lot. &ldquo;Darcy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Elizabeth&rdquo; are already together at the start, after all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun enough romp if you don&rsquo;t mind the fantastical displays of fabulous wealth. Interesting too, to see Michelle Yeoh as a controlling mother rather than a kickass starship captain.</p>

			 <p>I had cause to go to Westfield in Stratford the other day. It looked like this at about noon:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3608-1-scaled.jpeg"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3608-1-scaled.jpeg" class="aligncenter size-full" alt="IMG 3608" width="1857" height="1392" title="IMG_3608.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>The Levis shop was open. I was picking up some jeans that had been in for repair. That’s a good note for when this is all over, incidentally. If your Levis wear into holes or get torn, most of their shops offer a repair service now. They may have done for years; I only learned about it a month or so back. But it means that for significantly less than a new pair of jeans, I have <em>two</em> good-as-new pairs, including the ones which were <em>already</em> my favourites. One antidote to fast fashion.</p>
<p>There was almost no-one around, and no-one was getting very close to anyone. In Lakeland I was able to get a refill (really, replacement) for one of our SodaStream CO<sub>2</sub> cylinders. But they didn’t have any new ones. It seems unlikely that those have been panic-bought, but <em>I</em> was thinking of getting an extra one in case it becomes hard to get replacements, so others might have been ahead of me.</p>
<p>In and out within half an hour, and the parking was the least I’ve ever paid at Westfield: £3. I wouldn’t normally drive if I wasn’t buying much, but getting on the Overground would have been the opposite of social distancing.</p>
<p>Or maybe not, if it had been as empty as the mall.</p>
<p>But just yesterday I gave my daughter a lift to a friend’s house — same idea, avoid the bus — and up in Stamford Hill at around 4:30pm it was really busy with pedestrians. A lot of cars on the road, too. Maybe that was normal or less than, for that time on a Tuesday, though.</p>
<p>Dropped into the wee Sainsbury’s on the way back. No fresh fruit or veg at all. Most tinned goods and bread gone — no toilet rolls, obviously — plenty of snacks and crisps, surprisingly. Either panic-buyers prefer healthy options, or Sainsbury’s are quicker at getting unhealthy supplies back.</p>
<p>I have to confess to feeling a small amount of smugness at having stocked up over the last year or so. Brexit was the initial trigger, but I soon realised that having a supply of non-perishable items is actually pretty useful. If you can afford to buy a bit extra from time to time, and you’ve got the space to store it all, of course.</p>
<p>On the other hand, meals are going to get dull really fast without a regular supply of fresh things.</p>
<p>But if that’s the most we have to worry about, we’re doing better than many. I hope you are coping OK, dear reader.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Harry Potter fan fiction, by Merlin’s beard! I heard of this book — <a href="http://www.hpmor.com">HPMOR</a>, as it’s known — from my son, a couple of years ago. Didn’t think about it for a while, and then recently I saw a tweet from a friend-of-friends, <a href="http://twitter.com/ciphergoth">@ciphergoth</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The correct quote is "There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion." <a href="https://t.co/n3qAmdyhV2">https://t.co/n3qAmdyhV2</a> <a href="https://t.co/Agxq7FruRk">pic.twitter.com/Agxq7FruRk</a></p>
<p>— Paul Crowley (@ciphergoth) <a href="https://twitter.com/ciphergoth/status/1222276296492769280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The fact that it was a quote from Harry Potter, and that I didn’t recognise it — indeed, it didn’t seem like something Harry would say  — intrigued me, so I clicked through.</p>
<p>And then I shortly found myself downloading the ebook and reading it for the next… actually, month or so.</p>
<p>Because this book is <em>looooooong</em>! It’s a retelling of just the <em>first</em> Harry Potter book, along with much more, and it’s about half as long as all seven of the JKR originals.</p>
<p>In fact, it could have done with an editor. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it has some weaknesses.</p>
<p>First, the strengths, though. Yudkowsky can write a page-turner almost as well as Rowling. What we have here is an alternative universe in which Petunia Evans marries someone else, not Vernon Dursley. They adopt Harry, and bring him up in a loving home. Harry’s adoptive father is a scientist, which is where he learns his rationality. So his first thought when he discovers that magic exists is to try experiments to understand its capabilities and limits. Experimentation soon gets overwhelmed by events, though, as the plot gets going.</p>
<p>There are other differences from the original, of course, and the end result is very different.</p>
<p>Part of what Yudkowsky does is takes the literal translation of Voldemort’s name — “flees from death,” essentially — recognises the rationality of that feeling — who wouldn’t prefer going on living, to dying? — and builds from there.</p>
<p>The major flaws are wordiness and couple of authorial tics that get repetitive and mildly annoying. He has a tendency to refer to people by their role, rather than their name: “The Defence Professor,” rather than “Quirrell,” for example. Which is fine if used sparingly, for variety. But he has people referring to other people like that, when they just wouldn’t.</p>
<p>There’s also overuse of  scenes that start like, “The boy stood in the forest…” and only slowly revealing <em>which</em> boy. Again, fine occasionally, but he overdoes it.</p>
<p>And a few Americanisms creep in: like calling the staff of Hogwarts the “faculty.” And anachronisms: nobody apologised for their snarkiness in 1992, since the word hadn’t been coined yet. Well, I could be wrong there: <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/snarky">this site says</a> it goes back to 1906 or earlier. No-one in Britain, then.</p>
<p>But I shouldn’t complain. It’s an astonishingly well-constructed work, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Or at least, some of their instruments, clothing, lyrics, and memorabilia are in an <a href="https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/museum-london/whats-on/exhibitions/london-calling-40-years-clash">exhibition</a> which the Museum of London<sup id="fnref-6326-museum"><a href="#fn-6326-museum" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> has been running since the fortieth anniversary of <cite>London Calling</cite> in December.

<p>It’s small, but pretty good. The centrepiece is Paul Simenon’s smashed bass from the famous cover photo. It lies under glass on a red velvet cushion, like a fallen warrior lying in state (see above).</p>
<p>It’s actually kind of gruesome. “That’s no way to treat an expensive musical instrument,” as <a href="http://www.briangreene.com/bhg/2010/thats-no-way-to-treat-an-expensive-musical-instrument/">someone once said</a>.</p>

<p>I didn’t learn anything I didn’t already know, I don’t think. Except maybe that Joe had a backup <em>white</em> Telecaster, that I don’t think I’ve ever seen him use, either live, in video, or in photos. His iconic black one is in the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame, I believe. Or another museum.</p>
<p>Oh, and see the poster in that shot? “Two for a fiver”? When I bought <cite>London Calling</cite> it was only £3.99. Both times, as I’ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/12/21/calling-from-london/">written about before</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, worth checking out, especially since it’s free. My main complaint: there are a lot of songs that could have been playing, even if they kept it to the relevant album. Instead they had a loop of just three (“London Calling,” “Train in Vain,” and “Clampdown,” the latter two live versions).</p>

			 <html><body><p>Glen Matlock doesn’t seem to have much time for the past, except the past as he sees it. Cover versions of the New York Dolls, or one or other size of The Faces, are fine. But the songs that he co-wrote? The songs that are responsible for what fame he has — for 200 people being out on a cold, virus-infested night, to see him?</p>
<p>Those songs — that single song, in fact <sup id="fnref-6308-vacant"><a href="#fn-6308-vacant" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> — is relegated to the encore.</p>
<figure><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3597.jpeg"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3597-300x185.jpeg" alt="Glen Matlock and his band at the Red Lion Ballroom in Leytonstone" width="300" height="185" class="size-large wp-image-6315"></a> <figcaption>Glen Matlock and his band at the Red Lion Ballroom in Leytonstone</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with keeping your best-known songs for the encore, of course. But when the ticket site said “Curfew: 10:30,” and it’s 10:27 and there hasn’t been a single Pistols song, you can start to get a bit twitchy.</p>
<p>On the plus side, he did introduce “Pretty Vacant” by saying, “This is ‘SOS’,” referring to his borrowing of the intro riff from the Abba song.</p>
<p>It was a good night, though. His originals and the covers were all fine. It’s just that, if you heard a no-name pub band playing those songs — well, you wouldn’t bother going out specially for it.</p>
<p>The night was billed as “Glen Matlock + Earl Slick.” I’m embarrassed to admit I had to look up who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Slick">Slick</a> was. Turns out he only replaced Mick Ronson in Bowie’s band, and worked with John &amp; Yoko! And now he’s playing lead guitar in Glen Matlock’s band. Oh well.</p>

			 <p><p><img src="uploads/2022/2aeecf47d1.jpg"/></p> <p>I liked this a lot more than I expected to. When I saw the trailer (I think back in December, when we saw Knives Out) I was a bit freaked out by it. What’s this, you’ve got a film about a kid in the Hitler Youth, with Hitler as a character, and they seem to be playing it for comedy? This looks well dodgy.</p><p>My kids knew it was by Taika Waititi , though, and that seemed to make it likely to be OK? I dunno, but eventually I decided to give it a chance.</p><p>And it turns out to be really good. A sweet film in many ways, though with plenty of menace and darkness, as you'd expect from where and when it's set -- which is an unnamed German town or city in the dying days of the Second World War. Waititi himself plays Hitler, who is not in fact the real one, but an imaginary friend that lets Jojo, the ten-year-old title character, talk to someone about the things he can't talk to anyone else about.</p><p>So I enjoyed it, but I can't help asking: why did he choose to make this film? Why that story, why now? It's based on a novel, <cite>Caging Skies</cite> by Christine Leunens. But Wikipedia's description of it as "the internationally bestselling Hitler Youth novel" leaves me none the wiser.</p><p>Not, of course, that there has to be a specific reason for a creator to make something. And it's far from the first comedy about Hitler or the Nazis. But there's just something about the idea of it -- not the actuality -- that leaves me a little uncomfortable, in a way that The Great Dictator or The Producers didn't.</p></p>

			 <p>In <a href="https://onemanandhisblog.com/2020/02/general-election-politics-media-failure-reuters/">General Election 2019: the news media failed profoundly — but not in the way you think</a>, Adam Tinworth buries the “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/bury-the-lede-versus-lead">lede</a>.” Probably deliberately, as the whole piece is worth reading.</p>
<p>The key point is that the Reuters research showed that people spent only <em>16 minutes a week</em> on average reading news during the election.</p>
<p>That’s a <em>ludicrously</em> low figure.</p>
<p>Also odd is that the Shortcut that I used to create this post pulled this text out as the title: “The Media &amp; the 2019 General Election: trusted, but little consumed.” Which would be better in terms of <em>not</em> burying anything, but I can’t see where it came from. The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag, I’d have to guess, but you don’t really see those on a phone. And not that much on a computer, once you’ve got more than a couple of browser tabs open.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Translated by Stephen Snyder. I asked for this for Christmas, because I saw it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/20/the-memory-police-yoko-ogawa-review">reviewed</a> in <cite>The Guardian</cite> and it sounded interesting. And it is, but I had some problems with it.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Hat ribbon, bird, rose.</strong><br>
  <br>
  To the people on the island, a disappeared thing no longer has any meaning. It can be burned in the garden, thrown in the river or handed over to the Memory Police. Soon enough, the island forgets it ever existed.<br>
  <br>
  When a young novelist discovers that her editor is in danger of being taken away by the Memory Police, she desperately wants to save him. For some reason, he doesn’t forget, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to hide his memories. Who knows what will vanish next?
</p></blockquote>
<p>That “[f]or some reason” is where this book doesn’t quite work for me. The setup is fine: a type of item, and the memories, the very <em>idea</em> of that item, disappears. The titular police make sure that all instances of the item — roses, hats, photographs… — are removed. But some people keep their memories and the ideas, and try to keep the things. The Memory Police find them and cart them off.</p>
<p>The protagonist’s mother was taken in that way when the protagonist was small.<sup id="fnref-6249-names"><a href="#fn-6249-names" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Why is it happening? <em>How</em> is it happening? Who are the Memory Police, and what happens to the people they take? Can they be resisted, and how can the islanders get their memories back? These are the sorts of questions you would expect to have answered, were this a science fiction novel. Are the islanders the victims of some sort of mind-control experiment? Are they in a simulation?</p>
<p>This is not a science fiction novel.</p>
<p>“For some reason”. Don’t read this expecting to find out what the reason is, or to get answers to any of the other questions.</p>
<p>All that said, I enjoyed reading it. The sense of danger, of menace, is palpable, but subtle. It’s about people trying to live their lives under these bizarre conditions. It’s just frustrating thinking about it now, about the unanswered questions.</p>
<p>But maybe I’m reading it wrong. In her essay “<a href="https://www.tor.com/2010/01/18/sf-reading-protocols/">SF reading protocols</a>,” Jo Walton writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A reviewer wanted to make the zombies in Kelly Link’s “Zombie Contingency Plans” (in the collection <cite><a href="http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/titledetail.cfm?titleNumber=1185675">Magic For Beginners</a>)</cite> into metaphors. They’re not. They’re actual zombies. They may also be metaphors, but their metaphorical function is secondary to the fact that they’re actual zombies that want to eat your brains. Science fiction may be literalization of metaphor, it may be open to metaphorical, symbolic and even allegorical readings, but what’s real within the story is real within the story, or there’s no there there. I had this problem with one of the translators of my novel <cite>Tooth and Claw</cite>—he kept emailing me asking what things represented. I had to keep saying no, the characters really were dragons, and if they represented anything that was secondary to the reality of their dragon nature. He kept on and on, and I kept being polite but in the end I bit his head off—metaphorically, of course.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The essay is largely about how there is a “toolkit” for reading SF — a set of understandings, of tropes — without which some can find the genre  difficult to understand. We learn that toolkit, or build it, from early reading of the genre. But she follows the above quote with this:</p>
<blockquote>
  When I read literary fiction, I take the story as real on the surface first, and worry about metaphors and representation later, if at all. It’s possible that I may not be getting as much as I can from literary fiction by this method, in the same way that the people who want the zombies and dragons to be metaphorical aren’t getting as much as they could.
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe that’s what went wrong for me with <cite>The Memory Police</cite>: Ogawa wrote a metaphorical work — about people trying to live their lives under bizarre conditions, as I wrote above. I read it with the expectation that the bizarre conditions would have an explanation, and they don’t, because they are “only” metaphors.</p>
<p>For, I would have to suppose, a totalitarian state, where the slightest infraction of arcane and obscure laws leads to being carted away by the secret police.</p>
<p>We also get sections of the novel the protagonist is writing. It is about a woman who loses her voice, and communicates using a typewriter. Then the typewriter is taken away from her. It works as a metaphor for the situation the protagonist lives in: a metaphor within a metaphor.</p>
<p>And from the <cite>Guardian</cite> review that started this:</p>
<blockquote>
  Why this is happening is unknown; the ideology of totalitarian control and cultural isolation is implied, rather than explicitly outlined, and its intersection with the supernatural strengthens the feeling of allegory.
</blockquote>
<p>So maybe I should have been warned. Calling it “supernatural” suggests something more in the magic realism vein. That might be a better way to approach it. Magic needs — or at least, generally gets — less of an explanation.</p>

			 <html><body><p>The second of the <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/01/31/in-the-departure-lounge/">two good things today</a> is that Netflix now has the last few episodes of <cite>Bojack Horseman</cite>.</p>
<p>It seems my only reference to it here was one <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/05/5042/">allusive comment on the first episode</a>. But it has consistently been one of the best things on telly. People dismiss it because It’s a cartoon with talking animals, but it’s so much more than that.</p>
<p>Issues of addiction, depression, fame, guilt, and so much more, sit alongside the funny animals. And it can be very funny, too.</p>

<p>As this programme progressed it got hard to imagine how they were going to end it. And that remains true for me: they’ve already given us two good endings in the last two episodes, either of which would have been fine as a way to close the show. So how will they do it for real?</p>
<p>We’ll find out tonight.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Here we are, then, on the last day of the UK’s membership of the EU. We fought, we lost, and now we’ve got to live with the consequences.</p>
<p>Which won’t really start to take effect until the start of next year, of course, because we’ll be in the transition period until then. Until 2021 we’ll still be able to travel freely; there will be no added tariffs on goods; food standards will still be the high ones we’re used to.</p>
<p>Ah yes, food standards. Just the other day I had a realisation — no, it was something that I already knew. More a dawning fear of how close a bad thing was. What brought it home was this headline in the <cite>Independent</cite>: “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-chlorinated-chicken-us-trade-deal-boris-johnson-pompeo-trump-a9310081.html">Brexit: US insists chlorinated chicken must be on menu in any UK trade agreement</a>.”</p>
<p>Obviously no-one’s going to force anyone to buy or eat chicken, chlorine-washed or otherwise. But remember <em>why</em> chicken in the US is washed in chlorine, and why importing it into the EU is banned: it’s because the food standards are significantly lower than those in the EU. The chlorine washing is to kill off bacteria and make the meat fit for human consumption.</p>
<p>So what that headline means is that a US trade deal could depend on the UK lowering its food standards. That’s what Brexit means: our government could choose to lower the standards of hygiene required in food production. Sit with that thought for a while.</p>
<p>There are a couple of good things to think about on this bleak day. Both of those are also from America, and neither has anything to do with Brexit. But I’ll leave them for later posts. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>I leave you with this delightful snippet of Alex Andreou, on the <a href="http://www.remainiacs.com"><cite>Remainiacs</cite> podcast</a>, suggesting how to cope with today, and the future.</p>

			 <html><body><p>After my <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/01/17/who-the-what/">highly negative assessment of episode 3</a> (“the worst episode of Doctor Who <em>ever</em>“), episode 4, “Nikola Tesla’s Night of Terror,” was fine, if forgettable.</p>
<p>And then last Sunday, we got — wait…</p>
<p>SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS</p>
<p><strong>Don’t read on if you haven’t yet seen episode 5, “Fugitive of the Judoon.”</strong></p>
<p>OK. Last Sunday we got “Fugitive of the Judoon.” Which is without doubt the best episode of Chibnall’s time as showrunner, so far. And may well be the most important episode since the programme came back in 2005. Or at least, be the start of the farthest-reaching changes since Russell T Davies brought us the concept of the Time War.</p>
<p><em>Two</em> genuinely surprising reveals! Jack’s back; and… so is The Doctor? Whaaaattt???!!?</p>
<p>Fandom is, of course, rife with speculation as to where Jo Martin’s Doctor falls in The Doctor’s timeline. Future? Past? Or an alternative universe? And what of this “Lone Cyberman”?</p>
<p>Halfway through this, season, and it’s shaping up to be something very special. I just hope they don’t let us down.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I just installed the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono font</a>. We programmers need monospaced fonts, and this is a very nice one. It comes installed with recent versions of JetBrains’s IDEs. My copy of IntelliJ was <em>not</em> recent, it turned out.</p>
<p>Anyway, the most interesting thing is ligatures for programmers. Take a look at this:</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-19-at-23.25.11.png" alt="Screenshot 2020 01 19 at 23 25 11" title="Screenshot 2020-01-19 at 23.25.11.png" border="0"></p>
<p>You see that “not equals” sign? The crossed-out equals that we were taught to write back in secondary school? That’s not a character in any normal ASCII typeface. Plus, this is Java: even if it <em>were</em> a character (there is a Unicode character for that symbol), it’s not part of the language. The compiler wouldn’t recognise it.</p>
<p>What that actually is is the standard not-equals of C-based languages: <code>!=</code>. But the font has detected it and replaced it with the more attractive and traditional symbol.</p>
<p>It’s a setting you can disable, and I’m not sure I’ll keep it that way, but it’s impressive and unusual.</p>

			 <html><body><p>You probably want to know what I think of the new series of <cite>Doctor Who</cite> so far.</p>
<p>It got off to a really strong start with ‘Spyfall’ part 1. Not least with its genuinely surprising reveal at the end. And then part 2 followed up on it. Not everything made total sense, but what the hell, it’s <cite>Doctor Who</cite>. There were some complaints about the way the nazis and The Master were handled, and I get that. And it had the memory-wiping thing. But all in all, I found it a strong, promising start to the new season.</p>
<p>And then we got ‘Orphan 55.’</p>
<p>Oh dear. Oh dearie, dearie me. This was, for me — I’m not going to sugarcoat it — the worst episode of <cite>Doctor Who</cite> <strong>ever</strong>. At least in the modern era.</p>
<p>The story was confused and confusing, the direction was incoherent, the character motivations made no sense… Oh, and the message — admirable though it was, to say it was beating us over the head with a stick is to understate how heavy-handed it was.</p>
<p>I thought it must be a first-time writer and director. But no: it was written by Ed Hime, who wrote ‘It Takes You Away’ last season, which was very good. And it was directed by Lee Haven Jones, who directed ‘Spyfall’ part 2, just the week before.</p>
<p>So what went wrong? Hard say, but I’ve got to hope they pick things up again on Sunday.</p>

			 <p>This is a sweet little story, exactly described by its title. The professor in question is an elderly mathematician who has had a brain injury that has left him with only 80 minutes of short-term memory.

<p>She has a son who comes along sometimes, and there are maths puzzles and baseball.</p>

<p>This is a strong as it was <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2009/09/12/transitions-in-real-life/">ten years ago when I first read it</a>, but still has the same narrative flaw. That’s not surprising, but the flaw in the universe-hopping detail is so jarring that I read it half-hoping to pick up on something that I had missed the last time.</p>
<p>It was not to be. Our heroes and villains still hop to uninhabited Earths, and yet find a body there to receive them.</p>
<p>And of course, the ethical question of possessing another human being remains barely addressed.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Christmas is the time of year when the devil doesn’t have all the best tunes. The other side gets some of them too.</p>
<p>I love Christmas songs. Not all of them. of course, but many. And that includes some of the Christmas carols. A full choir singing ‘Hark the Herald Angels Sing,’ or ‘Oh Come All Ye Faithful’? I’m there.</p>
<p>The <em>best</em> Christmas songs, though, <em>do</em> belong to the — let’s say — secular side of things. I have a hierarchy of my personal favourites. Things move around a bit, and very occasionally new ones arrive; and you won’t be surprised to learn that ‘Fairytale of New York’ remains unassailable in the top spot.</p>
<p>One of my other favourites is Greg Lake’s 1975 hit, ‘I Believe in Father Christmas.’ Now, if you haven’t listened to the words too closely — written, I’m surprised to discover, by Peter Sinfield, of whom I had barely heard before researching this — you might think it’s a simple celebration of Christmas, set to a jaunty tune, much like Slade’s ‘Merry Xmas Everybody,’ from a couple of years earlier (and every year since). It’s not, though. It’s much darker and more interesting than that:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  They sold me a dream of Christmas<br>
  They sold me a Silent Night<br>
  They told me a fairy story<br>
  Till I believed in the Israelite
</p></blockquote>
<p>And that closing couplet:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Hallelujah, Noel, be it Heaven or hell<br>
  The Christmas we get we deserve
</p></blockquote>
<p>Lake and Sinfield have argued that it’s not anti-religious or atheistic. Well, you can have your interpretation, guys. I know what I think.</p>
<p>I mainly wrote this because I’ve wanted to use the line I’ve stolen as a title for years. And I’ll leave you with the wishes the song provides:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I wish you a hopeful Christmas<br>
  I wish you a brave New Year
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think we’re all going to need some hope and some bravery in 2020.</p>

			 <html><body><p>The final volume of Moore’s <cite>League</cite> stories, and, he says, his final work in the comics medium. If so, it’s not a bad closer.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that a significant portion of his comics output has been built on the work of others. Nothing wrong with that. Indeed, it could be said to be true of <em>all</em> literature, maybe all art. Moore’s use is more frequent than most, though: The <cite>Watchmen</cite> characters based on those from old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Comics">Charlton Comics</a>; <cite>Marvelman</cite>/<cite>Miracleman</cite> a revival of Mick Anglo’s creation; <cite>Promethea</cite> digging into mythology and fiction, as <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/10/promethea-by-alan-moore-jh-williams-iii-mick-gray-todd-klein-books-2018-27/">I wrote very positively about last year</a>; and so on.</p>
<p>In the <cite>League</cite> it’s at its most explicit. The main characters are Mina Murray from <cite>Dracula</cite>, Virginia Woolfe’s Orlando, and Alan Quatermain from H Rider Haggard’s novels (although he isn’t in this volume). Even the subtitle of this one is from Shakespeare.</p>
<p>There is, as I say, nothing wrong with any of that. It’s like sampling in music: it doesn’t matter that you’re using part of an earlier creation; what matters is what you <em>do</em> with it.</p>
<p>And what Moore and O’Neil do with everything here is pretty spectacular. I won’t go into any detail, but suffice it to say that pretty much all the threads from the earlier volumes are tied up, and everything is over at the end. <em>Everything</em>. Well, not <em>everything</em> everything. Not quite.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t start here, though: go back to the beginning if you want to read any of these. Read them all.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Forgetting for a minute the slightly-disappointing conclusion of a 42-year-old story that <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/12/20/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-2019-%E2%98%85%E2%98%85%E2%98%85%C2%BD/">we spoke about the other day</a>, this month gives us the 40th anniversary of an even more significant creation, for me at least.</p>
<p>The Clash released <cite>London Calling</cite> in December 1979. <cite>Rolling Stone</cite> went on to call it <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-best-albums-of-the-eighties-150477/the-clash-london-calling-5-163092/">the best album of the 80s</a>, but it got a later release in America. And in any case, many wouldn’t have heard it until 1980. <sup id="fnref-6087-40years"><a href="#fn-6087-40years" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Including me. I remember being at school, at the start of a term, so it must have been January, and Watty saying, “I envy you: you haven’t heard <cite>London Calling</cite> yet.” That idea of how important the first listen is. I’ve said similar things myself over the years, about various things.</p>
<p>But honestly, I couldn’t tell you anything about my first hearing. I had probably heard the title track — it was a single, after all — and I went and bought the album, most likely at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Menzies">John Menzies</a> in Dumbarton (though maybe at Hall Audio, the nearby hi-fi shop, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_Group">Woolies</a>, or Boots, who used to sell records in those days). I do know it cost £3.99, because the band took a reduction in their royalties so it — a double album — could be sold at the same price as a single album. Excellent value, for one of the greatest records ever made.</p>
<p>Though I paid for it a couple more times over the years. Someone walked off with my copy during a party at my student flat in Edinburgh. I replaced it with a second-hand copy, probably from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Record-Shak/131108243603860">Record Shak</a> (<em>sic</em>) on Clerk Street. Though possibly that was much later and in London. I had a tape of it to tide me over. I do know that the replacement cost the same: £3.99.</p>
<p>The CD must have cost me a bit more, but I didn’t get that until the <a href="http://greenandblackmusic.com/home/2017/07/29/the-clash-exploring-the-vanilla-tapes-london-calling-rehearsals-1979/">25th-anniversary version, with <cite>The Vanilla Tapes</cite></a>, the rehearsal-room recordings of early versions of several of the songs.</p>
<p>I could probably tell you a few things about the 7852 <sup id="fnref-6087-approx"><a href="#fn-6087-approx" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> times I’ve heard it subsequently, though. But it would be better for you to listen to it yourself.</p>
<p>And lastly, just a reminder that tomorrow is the 17th anniversary of Joe Strummer’s death.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://devilgate.org/2019/12/17/the-steep-approach-to-garbadale/">The Steep Approach to Garbadale, by Iain Banks (Books 2019, 23)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2019/12/17/the-steep-approach-to-garbadale/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-12-17 16:06:27 &#43;0100">Dec 17, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>One interesting thing about this book that I don’t recall noticing when I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2007/09/20/the-steep-approach.html">read it twelve years ago</a> is that the story itself <em>is</em> the titular approach. We don’t get to Garbadale House until about two-thirds of the way through, and then the rest of it is set there. With a few flashbacks and <span style="white-space: nowrap;">-forwards</span> thrown in to both sections.</p>
<p>Banksie always plays with form and structure, and this is no exception. Not just the aforementioned directional flashes, but use of different viewpoint characters and tenses. Mostly it’s from the viewpoint of Alban McGill, one of the many members of the Wopuld family. Some scenes are from that of a cousin of his. There are even a couple of instances of promiscuous PoV, or “head-hopping,” where we get the thoughts of another character within the same scene.</p>
<p>Also some parts switch to present-tense, while most if it is past. There doesn’t seem to be any obvious function to those switches: it’s not like the tense reflects the timeline within the story. It seems arbitrary, almost random — though maybe I’m missing something there.</p>
<p>None of this harms the story, it’s just worth noting. The strangest of these devices is that there are three or four sections in first-person, from the PoV of a minor character. All the rest is third-person. That gives the impression that this character is more significant than he is. The text in those sections is also rendered with spelling mistakes and grocer’s apostrophes, as if it was the direct transcript of what this relatively poorly-educated character has scribbled down.</p>
<p>What’s the point of all that? I’m not sure. Just writerly games, maybe. I wonder if it suggests that Banks didn’t think the story itself was interesting enough to sustain the narrative, which might be a valid criticism. A well-off family with a secret at its heart has to decide whether to sell its business. The secret comes out, but it doesn’t make much difference. It would be significant to the characters affected, but we hardly see them after the reveal.</p>
<p>Endearing characters, though, and even on a second read (I didn’t recall the secret), it keeps the pages turning.</p>
<p>As I said twelve years ago, “In a book like this, the pleasure is in the journey more than the destination.”</p>

			 <html><body><p>From <cite>The Guardian</cite>‘s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/what-we-learned-about-the-media-this-election?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">piece on what we learned in the election</a> about the media:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  One Labour MP who nearly lost their Brexit-backing seat told the Guardian that on doorstep after doorstep, people brought up Corbyn’s connections with the IRA after seeing memes and images on Facebook: “It was never used by the Tories in the campaign but there was a separate election going on, which was a Facebook-orientated campaign.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe this explains the hatred for Corbyn which <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/12/10/fear-and-loathing-all-over-the-land/">so mystified me</a>.</p>
<p>The next paragraph is astonishing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The MP suggested constituents are increasingly overwhelmed by information and unsure what is real and what is not, <strong>assuming there is some sort of editing of what goes on Facebook</strong>. “People have a sense that some of this stuff is probably wrong but they have no compass. They would say: <strong>‘But it’s on Facebook – how can there be something that isn’t true?’</strong> They think there are gatekeepers but there aren’t.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphases mine. Oh my god. How can anyone think that after all that’s happened? I realise that not everyone is as deeply into tech and politics as I am, but still.</p>
<p>We never had a chance, did we?</p>

<p>This is very disappointing. <cite>The OA</cite> was an incredible, confusing, glorious piece of work, and Brit Marling, its co-creator, has assured us that it all has a plan and an ending.</p>
<p>Now (or back in August, anyway) she’s had to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0ykCdLJYD5/?igshid=795lmp0b7qh3">write its obituary</a>. I suppose some other company might pick it up, but since it’s mostly Netflix who do that these days, it seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Presumably the two completed seasons, 16 episodes in total, will remain on Netflix. I‘d still recommend watching them. Just remember that you’ll be left somewhere strange.</p>

<p>But Swinson lost her seat by just 149 votes, which must be especially heartbreaking. She always impressed me as someone who knew what she was talking about and was on top of things. She was part of the Cameron/Clegg coalition, which is problematic, but let’s let that go.</p>
<p>She’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/12/general-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll?page=with:block-5df39a9d8f08b5e670043738#block-5df39a9d8f08b5e670043738">quoted</a> as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  One of the realities of smashing glass ceilings is that a lot of broken glass comes down on your head.
</p></blockquote>
<p>which is great, and sad.</p>
<p>People criticised her for making the Liberal Democrat campaign too presidential, too much about her, and that probably was a mistake. Though would they have criticised a male leader in the same way?</p>
<p>And there’s the business of promising to revoke Article 50. Which I was and am completely in favour of, even if it can seem undemocratic.<sup id="fnref-6051-art50"><a href="#fn-6051-art50" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> The problem was not the promise, but the messaging. The story should have been, “Elect us to government and you’ll give us a mandate to revoke. Give us less power and we’ll work for a second referendum.” That <em>was</em> the story: she just seemed to have some difficulty expressing it in clear, simple terms, at least in the debates I saw.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Well tonight is a fucking disaster. Even if the reality is lower than the exit poll, it looks like it’s going to be a landslide for the Tories. We’ll get a hard Brexit starting in a month and a half (and taking years and years before it “gets done,” of course). We’ll see more privatisation in the NHS. We’ll see more austerity, I don’t doubt, despite the spending pledges that might have been in the Tory manifesto. And we’ll see moves to restrict what parliament and the courts can do to protect ordinary people.</p>
<p>Our best hope is that Johnson is incompetent, and that’s not something we should have to rely on.</p>
<p>What is wrong with this country? Why do people continue to vote against not just the interests of the most vulnerable in society, but against their <em>own</em> self interest?</p>
<p>On Twitter a lot of people are blaming Corbyn, and I think they’re right. I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/12/10/fear-and-loathing-all-over-the-land/">said just the other day</a> that I didn’t understand the dislike; but a thread by <a href="http://twitter.com/RussInCheshire">@RussInCheshire</a> has helped to clarify my thinking. This regards not so much why people generally dislike him, but why he was ineffectual or worse as a leader. The key points:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  People will say “the media is biased”. Yes. But that’s the environment Labour leaders always operate in. Complaining about it is like trawler captains complaining the sea is wet. Yep. Learn to thrive in those conditions, or get off the boat.</p>
<p>  People will say “they treated him worse than any previous leader”. They did. Cos he was shit at working the press, had a history of opinions that could be easily made to look awful, was inept on antisemitism, shifty on Brexit and cantankerous on TV.</p>
<p>  People will say “no way is he racist”. Perhaps. But if people accused me of antisemitism, I’d be able to clearly defend myself, demonstrate my credentials, and put in place a strategy to stop accusations. He couldn’t. If he’s not antisemitic, he’s inept.</p>
<p>  People will say “voters love him in person”. I’m sure. But we’ve been in the age of broadcasting for 80 years. What the hell use is being warm and cuddly to 600 people in a field, when you come over badly to 60 million people on TV?
</p></blockquote>
<p>The thread <a href="https://twitter.com/RussInCheshire/status/1205249028637806592">starts here</a>, but it might be easier to read <a href="https://threader.app/thread/1205249028637806592">here, as expanded</a> by the <a href="https://threader.app">Threader App</a>.</p>
<p>I still don’t understand — I never will — people who switch from Labour all the way to Conservative. They just vox-popped someone on the telly who used to vote Labour, but “couldn’t, in conscience,” vote for them with Corbyn as leader. Fair enough. But she voted Tory. Why go all the way over to the party that diametrically opposes the values she claims to support, when there are other progressive parties, that support some of those values. The party she voted for opposes those values.</p>
<p>Baffling. Utterly baffling.</p>

			 <html><body><p>The time is almost upon us, and I have The Fear. Or at least, I understand The Fear.</p>
<p>I understand the fear of Brexit; of giving the Tories control, yet again, of the NHS, and of <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2011/01/05/republicans-good-at-theatre-dreadful-at-governing/">the economy</a>; and of their plans for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/tory-manifesto-conservative-boris-johnson-dictator-general-election-brexit-a9216861.html">changing the constitution</a> in all the wrong ways, since I feel it myself.</p>
<p>But despite my <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/11/10/ex-corbyn-fan/">problems</a> with <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/11/11/deeds-not-words/">Corbyn</a>, I don’t understand the loathing for him. It doesn’t seem to come from dislike of his policies. Some of the people who say they don’t like or don’t trust him seem to be Labour voters, who you’d expect to have similar beliefs. Even if those people have more centrist beliefs, you’d think they’d be close enough to the party’s current policies  not to be put off totally.</p>
<p>It seems almost to be <em>personal</em>. Do some people dislike him as a person? Strikes me as odd, as he comes across as quite moderate and reasonable to me. To be sure, he can get snappy with interviewers at times, but it’s nothing compared to some people. And at least he doesn’t bluster; doesn’t lie; and always gives the impression that he knows what he’s talking about.</p>
<p>Yet some people say they don’t trust him. Sometimes those same people say they <em>do</em> trust Johnson, even as they acknowledge he lies. It’s unfathomable.</p>
<p>On tonight’s <cite>Channel 4 News</cite> they interviewed a guy in Johnson’s constituency who claimed to be a socialist, but who is going to vote for Johnson this time. They didn’t push him for an explanation.</p>
<p>In the same constituency there was a business owner who had always voted Tory but is <em>not</em> going to this time, because of the way the party has been taken over by the far right. It takes a Tory businessman to recognise what a “socialist” can’t. We are through the looking glass and no mistake.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ll be voting Green. I hope everyone reading this will get out and vote on Thursday, for anyone who isn’t the Tories, and to stop Brexit.</p>

Walked in, took my earphones out, and, Wham! there it was. George Michael geving his heart to someone. Ever noticed that? He doesn’t say “gave,” he says “gev.” My daughter pointed this out a couple of years back, and now I can’t unhear it.</p>
<p>Oh well, there was never a chance of <em>not</em> hearing it, and to be honest, I don’t hate it like I used to. Remember back when we thought that bands like Wham! or Duran Duran were somehow “the enemy”? Those were stupid ideas. Music is music, and people have different tastes. Let’s let everyone enjoy what they like without judging them.</p>
<p>The most amusing part was that I heard a little girl in the queue behind me saying to her mum, “I just got Whammed.”</p>
<p>Also it’s odd that I haven’t heard ‘Fairytale of New York’ yet this year, except as a weird brass band version that was on the telly advertising some programme.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I succumbed. As I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/11/14/watchmen-by-alan-moore-dave-gibbons-books-2019-21/">suggested I might</a>.</p>
<p>It felt a little grubby, going to the NowTV site and setting up an account. As you know, Sky TV and I have a history. Or maybe an anti-history, insofar as I am anti everything that their former owner stands for. But the key word is “former.” With Comcast now owning it, I can feel a little better about giving them my time and possibly some money.</p>
<p>Still, though: grubby.</p>
<p>But what’s worse, as a viewing experience, is that their app is the worst video-playback app I’ve ever used. It’s fine at all the basics; it even has a ten-second jump back and forward feature, which is good. But! It completely fails at subtitles.</p>
<p>Now,  in this era — this platinum age of television — subtitles are often an essential part of viewing. And that isn’t true just due to my age, because my kids, who are young adults, are at least as likely as us olds to want them on. Mumblecore actors are to blame. Or maybe bad sound on our TV. Or a combination. Doesn’t matter. We watch with subtitles on <em>a lot</em> of the time, and I wanted them on for <cite>Watchmen</cite>.</p>
<p>But NowTV — in its Mac app, at least — just can’t handle them properly. They either freeze, so you get the same sentence stuck on the screen for five minutes; or they just get out of sync. Sometimes they rush through minutes of text at a time, as if trying to catch up. In the end I turned them off.</p>
<p>But I watched one episode on my iPad, and the subtitles were fine there. So I guess it is the actual Mac app. The Mac plugged into the telly is an old one. A <em>nine-year-old</em> MacBook Pro, in fact. I’m impressed that it’s still working, though I did <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2016/04/27/i-upgraded-my-macbook/">upgrade it at one point</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, that can’t be the reason it’s bad, because I’ve also tried it on my 2017 MBP, with exactly the same results.</p>
<p>But what about the programme?</p>
<p>It’s a sequel to the comic, set around thirty years later. I found the first episode kind of annoying, though I’m not quite sure why. Too much of it set in the past, maybe? But as we’ve got to know the characters and things have moved along, it’s definitely interesting. I’ve watched the first five episodes so far. Up to which point it’s kind of a cop show with an unusual background. Cops go masked so that criminals can’t identify them. Criminals go masked too, of course, specifically in Rorscach-style black and white masks.</p>
<p>And there’s a mysterious old guy who puts on plays reenacting the origin of <a href="https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Osterman">Doctor Manhattan</a>. You’ll have guesses about who he is, if you know the source material. Well, one guess.</p>
<p>I like the way they’ve built on the comic, and are weaving the backstory in. Though I think it must be extremely confusing for anyone who hasn’t read the novel, or at least seen the movie.</p>
<p>My main question (apart from the obvious ones, like what’s going on with Veidt?) is: why is <a href="https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Laurie_Juspeczyk">Laurie</a> using her father’s surname? It doesn’t make sense to me that she’d call herself Blake, instead of Juspeczyck.</p>
<p>Oh, and whatever happened to <a href="https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Dan_Dreiberg">Dan Dreiberg</a>? I want to see some Nite owl action. Something that looked a lot like the <a href="https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Owlship">Owlship</a> appeared in the first episode, so maybe he’ll turn up. As, I imagine, will Doctor Manhattan.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I don’t doubt that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/labour-has-let-poison-of-antisemitism-take-root-says-chief-rabbi">many Jewish people are put off voting Labour</a> because of the antisemitic actions of some of its members, and the leadership’s seeming inability to control or remove those  people. Plenty of non-Jewish people are put off by it too.</p>
<p>There are two things I don’t understand.</p>
<p>If there are antisemites in Labour (which, again, does seem to be the case): why and how? Who are these people that have joined a party of the left, a party that has always been anti-nazi, anti-racist, pro equality and human rights — who join it, and yet stand in direct opposition to its core values? It’s like a climate-change denier joining the Green Party.</p>
<p>Further, why now? Why has this blown up in the last couple of years? These invasive members presumably haven’t <em>just</em> joined the party. It’s hard to imagine that they joined because of Corbyn being the leader.</p>
<p>Unless that’s exactly what it is. Maybe Corbyn’s seeming weakness on responding to the problem. and/or a willful misunderstanding of his stance on Palestine and the government of Israel, has attracted such people to the party. In which case — in any case — the obvious thing to do is to find them and eject them; just as they can easily eject members who suggest voting for another party.</p>
<p>I see that <cite>The Guardian</cite> has published an “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/antisemitism-labour-everything-you-need-to-know">everything you need to know</a>” guide on the matter. Which is good, but it doesn’t really answer my questions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn-rabbi-criticism-labour">Corbyn has spoken out against antisemitism</a> again. He may have appeared vague on Brexit, but I don’t think he could be any clearer on this.</p>

			 <html><body><p>You shouldn’t read this book.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>I broke a personal rule, that goes back to 1982: Never start reading a fantasy series if the final volume hasn’t been published.<sup id="fnref-5943-pinch"><a href="#fn-5943-pinch" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> 1982 was the year I was reading Stephen Donaldson’s <cite>The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant</cite>. The fifth volume (or second volume of the second series) was out, but the sixth and final wasn’t.<sup id="fnref-5943-whitegold"><a href="#fn-5943-whitegold" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> I waited on tenterhooks.<sup id="fnref-5943-tenter"><a href="#fn-5943-tenter" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup> Eventually the hardback came out, but it was much too expensive for a poor student like me. Luckily, not for another poor student on my corridor, who lent it to me.</p>
<p>I learnt my lesson, back then. More or less: I was reading <cite>Harry Potter</cite> while it was still being written. But this is one of the main reasons why I never started <cite>A Game of Thrones</cite>, for example.</p>
<p>But here we are. Two-thirds of the way in to a compelling, thrilling story… actually that’s not quite right, what with <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/05/20/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-the-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-books-2018-12/">the first volume</a> being prequel. More like halfway through a very long story, and all I can say is… not very much without going into massive spoilers.</p>
<p>I like that Lyra is using Silvertongue as her surname: a name she was given, that she <em>earned</em>. There are aspects of the world, of Lyra’s relationship to it, that are surprising, given what she went through in <cite>His Dark Materials</cite>. But then, it <em>is</em> eight years later, and she has grown up a lot.</p>
<p>Politics and events in the world of the Magisterium sometimes parallel those in our world.</p>
<p>It’s a lot darker and more adult-themed than the original trilogy. I don’t know if the whole will end up being as legendary or as moving as the original, of course, but at this point, balanced on the fulcrum of change, I like it almost as much.</p>
<p>I lied at the the start: you <em>should</em> read this book. But be prepared for the fact that we might have to wait two years for the conclusion.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I watched the election debate between Corbyn and Johnson on ITV. It was unedifying, and not very revealing. Corbyn was, predictably, calmer, more sensible, and less blustering. He needed to answer the “What way would you campaign in a second referendum” question that Johnson kept going back to, but otherwise he handled it pretty well.</p>
<p>Johnson, of course, is the epitome of bluster, barely gave a straight answer to anything, and went over his allotted time on every question, as well as his opening and closing statements.</p>
<p>I criticise him for that since he was violating the agreed-upon format. But the time-limited questions may have been the worst part of the event. The purpose is to limit bloviation, I suppose, but it seemed like often the chair was cutting the speaker off while they were still trying to make a point. I saw a tweet while it was going on, to the effect that part of the problem in politics is that everything is reduced to soundbites, with no opportunity to go into details. I’m inclined to agree.</p>
<p>However, much more interesting, and a bettter format, was the interviews, an hour later, with the leaders of the some of the other parties: Jo Swinson, Nicola Sturgeon, Siân Berry of the Greens, and, unfortunately, Nigel Farage.</p>
<p>One interviewer, one interviewee at a time, and it was all much more sensible. That is, in part, because of the people involved, of course. The three women were all good, especially Wee Nicola, as we like to call her. But perhaps it wouldn’t have worked so well if Johnson had been in the interviewee’s chair. He’d have been havering and talking over the interviewer, no doubt. Though to be fair, Farage managed not to do that, so who knows.</p>
<p>But overall, I think that the debate format is not the best way to present your ideas.</p>

The world is based on a role-playing game — or at least, it seems to be at first. The other night I started the latest issue, 9. Unexpectedly — but not surprisingly — Charlotte Brontë turned up as a character (or maybe not, but let’s run with it). The story was about how she and her siblings had created complex fantasy worlds in part as stories for their toy soldiers. And maybe the world of <cite>Die</cite> is based in part on those.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise, then, when I woke the next day to hear on the radio news that a tiny book — “no bigger than a matchbox” — written by Charlotte, was being auctioned in France. It is filled with stories of the fantasy worlds created by her and her siblings.</p>
<p>The book has been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50458343">bought by the Brontë Society</a>. It will be kept in the Brontë Parsonage Museum, where it was created.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Minor spoilers ahead.</p>
<p>I am <em>loving</em> what they’re doing with <cite>HDM</cite><sup id="fnref-5918-hdm"><a href="#fn-5918-hdm" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> in the BBC/HBO adaptation. It has just enough variation from the books to keep it interesting (especially since I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/11/11/northern-lights-the-subtle-knife-and-the-amber-spyglass-by-philip-pullman-books-2019-18-19-20/">re-read them recently</a>). Yet it manages not to distort the story in the way that so upset my then-ten-year-old son in the film version of (part of) the first book.</p>
<p>Bringing in the scenes of Lord Boreal crossing to “our” Oxford, and finding out about who Grumman is, is inspired. It will have the effect of making more sense of the inciting incident for Will, when he turns up. In the book it was never entirely clear who the people who searched his house were sent by, and why the authorities were interested in him. This way, it will.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to next week’s arrival of Lin-Manuel Miranda as Lee Scoresby.<sup id="fnref-5918-lee"><a href="#fn-5918-lee" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> And we’ll get Iorek Byrnison, too. That’ll be a big test of the CGI.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the only thing that slightly lets it down: Pantalaimon’s default form as an ermine. It looks a little too fake and plasticky to me. Most of the other daemons look fine, so I don’t know why the lead one should be so poor. Maybe it’s because he’s the only one that gets much screen time where he talks.</p>
<p>On that note, two points about Mrs Coulter’s daemon, one which struck me on my recent reread, and the other just tonight. We never learn its name. Nearly every other daemon that gets a mention, gets a name. And it never speaks. Certainly not so far in the TV version, and I’m fairly sure it never does in the books, either.</p>
<p>Which no doubt tells us something about the character of the woman.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I like to reread this from time to time, and right now I’m considering watching the TV version that’s currently on. It’s HBO, which means Sky over here, which would traditionally have ruled it out on ethical grounds. But times and corporate ownerships have changed. The Murdochs no longer own Sky TV, so I can let myself watch it.</p>
<p>But then we have the other ethical question, about <cite>Watchmen</cite> in particular. Which is to say, since Alan Moore feels that he was cheated by DC over the ownership of the creative work, and repudiates all derivative works, shouldn’t we avoid them too? I saw the movie version, but I didn’t get the <cite>Before Watchmen</cite> spin-offs.</p>
<p>Well, it’s been a long time; Moore and Gibbons must have known what they were signing up for, even if things didn’t go quite as they expected. I recall seeing Moore at a convention in Glasgow in 1985 or 86, where he said, “DC are <em>utter vermin</em>.” Yet he went on to work with them often after that.</p>
<p>Plus, I’m already reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock_%28comics%29"><cite>Doomsday Clock</cite></a>, which brings the <cite>Watchmen</cite> universe into the DC multiverse, so personally, that ship has sailed.</p>
<p>How does the story stand up today? It’s still excellent, I would say. With the obvious weakness of the ending. Though thinking about that, what’s weak is how preposterous Veidt’s plan is. Accepting that, that part of the story is well executed.</p>
<p>It’s still one of my favourite comics.</p>

			 <html><body><p><cite>His Dark Materials</cite>, as <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/10/27/on-pausing-stories/">I said</a>.</p>
<p>Holy hell, this trilogy is good! I think I’d forgotten just how good it is.</p>
<p>In the first book we meet Lyra, a wild orphan who lives in fabled Jordan College in a parallel Oxford. Plots and adventures quickly ensue.</p>
<p>The second volume starts with Will, a boy who lives in our world, and who has to run from his home because he has killed someone. How will his story connect to Lyra’s?</p>
<p>And the third builds on everything that has gone before, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>There are armoured bears, angels, daemons, airships, witches, harpies, the dead, and much else. The fate of worlds hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read it, you should. You could start watching the TV series instead, but I expect there’ll be a long wait between the seasons, and the books are right there.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m going to find myself in a similar position with the sequels. It was eighteen months ago that <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/05/20/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-the-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-books-2018-12/">I read part 1</a>, so presumably we won’t get the conclusion till some time in 2021.</p>
<p>I like what they’re doing with the TV series so far. Enough changes to keep it interesting, not enough to spoil it.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I don’t fully understand the rationale of the Lib Dems and SNP pushing for an election at this point. No-deal is still firmly <em>on</em> the table, it seems to me, and if the Tories get a big majority — or even just an <em>actual</em> majority — then we remainers are done for.</p>
<p>Yet Ian Dunt at politics.co.uk <a href="https://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2019/10/29/election-2019-remainers-have-one-last-chance">describes it at as “one last chance” for remainers</a>. He makes a compelling case. If he hadn’t gone for the election, Johnson could likely have got the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) through parliament. This way, at least there’s a chance. A hung parliament, a coalition that gives us a second referendum.</p>
<p>A new Remain campaign that is successful.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of “ifs,” and we lose everything if any one of them goes the wrong way.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/timelines/1189342201123344385">Carole Cadwalladr reminds us</a> that the illegality and foreign money in the referendum have never been addressed.</p>
<p>Another “if”: if Johnson could have got the deal through parliament, why did he back down and go for the election? Maybe it’s just be that he expects to get a majority, and thereby make it easier to get the WAB through in a new parliament. But I can’t help thinking that he’s up to something. That he and Dominic Cummings have some plan that will get around parliament somehow.</p>
<p>Hard to see what that could be, but how far would <em>you</em> trust those proven liars and crooks?</p>

			 <html><body><p>Almost exactly a year ago I started reading a novel, then put it on hold. This year I’ve done the same, for different reasons.</p>
<p>I started <cite>The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet</cite> by Becky Chambers in October of last year. I quickly put it aside as November approached. I realised that it — or at least its start — was much too similar to the <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/31/5196/">novel that I planned to start for NaNoWriMo</a>.</p>
<p>I haven’t got back to it yet.</p>
<p>This year it was the new Philip Pullman, <cite>The Book of Dust vol 2: The Secret Commonwealth</cite></p>
<p>Now, you’ll recall that I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/05/20/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-the-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-books-2018-12/">said I might do this</a> after I read the first of the new trilogy. Other things got in the way of that, though.</p>
<p>So I read a chapter or two of the new one, and realised I needed to refresh my memories. There’s a whole thing that we learn about at once that I don’t remember. Or at least don’t remember how it happened.</p>
<p>There’s also a TV series coming. I was aware it was in development, but not of how soon it was going to be. Turns out it’ll be on in a week or two.</p>
<p>So now I’m worried that  watching it is going to be a bit like the recent <cite>Good Omens</cite> series was for me; really well done, I appreciated it… but I had <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/05/21/good-omens-by-terry-pratchett-and-neil-gaiman-books-2019-6/">re-read the book</a> too soon before watching it, meaning it was all just a bit too recent in my memory for maximum enjoyment. But we’ll cross that ice bridge to another world when we come it it. The trailers look great, anyway.</p>
<p>The difference with this year’s pause will be that, while I will get back to the Chambers eventually, I’m obviously not in any hurry to do so. Whereas I fully expect to restart <cite>The Secret Commonwealth</cite> as soon as I’ve recovered from the ending of <cite>The Amber Spyglass</cite>. Which I’ll probably be starting quite soon.</p>

			 <html><body><p>It’s to my shame that I hadn’t read this classic of modern literature before now. And it turns out, now that I have, that it’s really good. Surprise, surprise. I don’t really care for dystopias, <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2015/09/08/station-eleven-by-emily-st-john-mandel-books-2015-8/">as I’ve said before</a>. Interesting that the book I linked to there had just won the Clarke, and the one we’re discussing was the inaugural winner of that award.</p>
<p>For the first few chapters I was distracted by wondering how this situation, this state, could have come to be. Strangely what I found difficult to cope with was not the restrictions, the rolling back of rights — they are horrific, but I could and can easily imagine an America (or, hell, maybe even a Britain) that could enact those laws.</p>
<p>No, what I found hardest to believe in was the dress codes. The way not just the Handmaids, but the marthas (domestic servants), econowives (lower-class, probably infertile women, assigned to lower-class men) and even Wives (the wives of the ruling-class men) all dress in the standard costume of their class.</p>
<p>Somehow I feel — or at least felt — that it would be harder to get everyone to dress the same way than to obey laws that restrict more important freedoms.</p>
<p>As the chapters went on, those concerns evaporated. The telling of the backstory through Offred’s reminiscences outlines a convincing route from 80s America to Gilead. Though a lot more could be told: it is only an outline. Still, it’s enough.</p>
<p>These days, with actual nazis poisoning our political discourse, and attempts to roll back reproductive rights <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/06/french-protests-against-ivf-treatment-for-gay-and-single-women">even in France</a>, it sometimes feels — as Atwood no doubt intended — that Gilead is not so much a fable as a warning.</p>

<p>That much is true. But Binet uses it as the jumping-off point for a mystery caper of sorts, in various picturesque cities in Europe (and a brief dip into the US). Because Barthes was believed to have been carrying a paper detailing the titular function.</p>

			 <html><body><p>We’ve been getting <cite>The Guardian</cite> delivered on Saturdays for several years. Not any other days, because who has time to read paper newspapers except at the weekend? But it’s great to get up and have the paper there to read over breakfast.</p>
<p>Sadly, a couple of weeks back we got a note with our delivery:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Sorry, we are stopping deliveries from the 1st of October.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Not too surprising, I suppose. It’s hard to imagine that enough people get deliveries to make it worth their time and effort. And it’s not like they’re going out of business: they’ll still be selling papers, just not delivering them.</p>
<p>So I suppose we’ll have to go out and <em>buy</em> the paper on Saturday mornings, like it’s the — actually, not like it’s the past at all. I’d bet that there have been newspaper deliveries as long as there have been newspapers.</p>
<p>Still, it’s not like they’ve stopped everywhere. I expect there are still a few places out there that still deliver. But what next? Will our milkman stop delivering?<sup id="fnref-5856-milk"><a href="#fn-5856-milk" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>

			 <html><body><p>If you saw <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/09/06/5835/">my post the other day</a> complaining about typography, you might have been confused. I went to see Jason &amp; The Scorchers last Friday. They were playing in a co-headline tour with the Kentucky Headhunters and Dan Baird &amp; Homemade Sin.</p>
<p>On the night we saw them, the order they took the stage was: Headhunters, Scorchers, Homemade Sin.</p>
<p>That was completely the wrong order, at least for the audience at London’s Shepherd’s Bush Empire on that night. The energy and connection of the Scorchers meant that the peak for the whole event came as they finished their set — in the middle of the evening.</p>
<p>No doubt you think I just think that because I’m a fan of the Scorchers, and not particularly of Dan Baird. And there is some truth to that. But I watched the last twenty minutes or so from off to one side — OK, I was standing at the bar — so I had a good view of the front of the crowd; and it was clear that they weren’t as excited, as into it, as <em>involved</em>, as they had been an hour before.</p>
<p>No matter, it was still a great night, and I’m sure some people were happy that the running order was that way round. What drove me to post that picture, though, was the distraction that backdrop caused me. I couldn’t really appreciate the music for staring at it.</p>
<p>In case it’s not obvious to you, take a look at the ampersand, and tell me how there’s any possible way it can make sense in that orientation.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Quentin Tarantino’s <cite>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</cite> is kind of a love story, kind of a biopic, and kind of a history.</p>
<p>Note that this post contains spoilers. Don’t read on if you haven’t seen it and care about being spoiled.</p>
<p>Or maybe “buddy pic,” rather than “love story;” but the relationship between the two leads will be analysed for its homoerotic content, no doubt.</p>
<p>How it certainly <em>has</em> been described is “a love letter to Hollywood,” and that’s fair enough. What it also is, is a counter-factual, or alternative history. But don’t worry, I’m not going to claim this one for SF.<sup id="fnref-5837-sf"><a href="#fn-5837-sf" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The main characters – fading cowboy actor Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his regular stunt double Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt – are invented. But most of the other named characters, and many who are mentioned or appear as extras, are real people. The most significant of these is Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie. And it’s her story that makes this film most interesting, and maybe problematic.</p>
<p>Because of course she died tragically, murdered by members of Charles Manson’s “Family” cult. And in this version — she doesn’t.</p>
<p>If you know the history — which of course, many younger people won’t, which makes for different ways of experiencing the film — then you spend half the time expecting the massacre. There are captioned dates, and even though most of us wouldn’t know the date of the murders, there can’t really be any other reason for showing them. And then when it comes, something else happens.</p>
<p>The violence in that scene is gruesome, over the top, ludicrous — almost hallucinogenic, making me wonder if the tripping Booth<sup id="fnref-5837-transgressor"><a href="#fn-5837-transgressor" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> is meant to have hallucinated some or all of it. But there’s no need for there to be so much of it, or for the majority of it to be directed at women. The “Family” did consist largely of women, I guess, but I can’t help but feeling that Tarantino is revelling in it a little too much.</p>
<p>And on top of all that, as my family agreed after seeing it: there’s no real <em>need</em> for the whole Sharon Tate thread of the story. It would have made a fine tale if were just about the two actors against the backdrop of late-60s Hollywood. I wonder what the point of it was. Did Tarantino feel he could in some way “save” Sharon Tate?</p>

<p>A genuinely chilling, even scary, ghost story, is not something you read that often. Or I don’t, these days, at least.</p>
<p>Combine that with compelling characters, comedy, and tragedy, and you’ve got kind of a small masterpiece.</p>
<p>I only say “small” because it’s quite short. I only know Jackson from a film version of “The Lottery” that they used to show us in school. I’m not sure <em>why</em> they showed us it, exactly, because we didn’t study it in English, and as far as I recall we didn’t discuss it. I think maybe it was a sort of treat, and the school only had a few films, that it showed repeatedly. These were actual <em>films</em>, I should add. Played on a projector, watched on a screen.</p>
<p>Anyway Jackson’s story always stuck with me, and now this one joins it.</p>

<p>We went to WOMAD a couple of weekends ago, and in the literary tent we caught the end of a reading from, and an interview with, this young Hackney writer. It was an interesting talk and the book sounded compelling, so we bought a copy (and got it signed).</p>
<p>It’s set over 36 minutes on the inaugural journey of a new (nonexistent) London bus route, from Hoxton to Highbury. Told as the thoughts and conversations of various passengers (and the driver).</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with the area and the local slang (which may in fact be national or global slang in places), it’s particularly enjoyable. But the themes are universal, so don’t suppose it’s <em>only</em> for Hackney &amp; Islington folk.</p>
<p>I have my problems with the ending, but it’s well worth checking out (and it’s very short, and in bite-sized pieces, if you’re looking for something easy).</p>

<p>This was recommended to me by an Open University tutor when I was doing the creative writing course a few years back. Which experience, I note, I barely wrote about here. I have a Diploma in Creative Writing, don’t you know?</p>
<p>Anyway, there was an exercise which included writing a plan for the next major piece we were going to write. I wanted to write something that was set in an exotic city, and I mentioned in my plan that I wanted the city to be a character in the story. I was thinking maybe of something like China Miéville’s <em>Bas-Lag</em>.</p>
<p>My tutor suggested that the shopping centre in this book might be a similar kind of thing. Which turns out not really to be accurate. It’s set largely in and around the mall, and some people say they have a sense of it watching them, but nothing is ever made of that.</p>
<p>It’s strange, in that it starts off apparently being a kids’ book, or at least YA; but after the first part it takes a turn, into something else entirely.</p>
<p>It’s not bad, but I wouldn’t particularly recommend it.</p>

<p>This is not mainly a book about <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles">The Troubles</a>; nor about religion or politics, though it is about all of those. It's a book, above all, about gossip and rumour and silence, and the harm that those can do to a person, to a society.</p>
<p>The unique approach — no-one is named, almost no proper names appear — I found quite endearing. And far from obfuscating things, it many ways it makes the story <em>easier</em> to follow. Instead of having to remember whether Mary, Margaret or Roisin is the oldest sister, it's “first sister.” “Oldest friend;” “maybe-boyfriend.” Honestly, all books should be like this. Relationships are important, after all.</p>
<p>Though you can also see it as a sly reference to the common complaint about living in small communities, that you're always someone's daughter, someone's brother — never yourself.</p>
<p>Anyway, Booker Prize winner, and all. Dead good.</p>

			, with some reservations. This one was similar. I read it in a day — it's quite the page-turner — and it has a compelling plot trigger.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first-person narrator is an entity who can jump into any human body from its current host, just by making skin-to-skin contact — the "touch" of the title. Male or female, young or old, it doesn't matter. The host doesn't know anything about it while they are possessed, and is left unharmed — unless, of course, something happens to their body while the possessor is in control.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sounds pretty gruesome like that, so it's impressive that our sympathies are with the narrator throughout.

This is an incredible piece of work, about an incredible body of work.</p>
<p>I don’t recall how I heard about it. I think I saw a tweet, or something, thought it looked interesting, and instantly bought it because it was only a few quid on Kindle. It’s a huge book which tries — successfully, in my mind — to explain how the bulk of David Lynch’s creative works can be considered part of a single story, which Horton refers to as <cite>The Dream</cite>.</p>
<p>Now obviously <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, <cite>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</cite>, and <cite>Twin Peaks: The Return</cite> are all part of the same story. As are the various spinoff books: Jennifer Lynch’s <cite>The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer</cite>, and Scott Frost’s <cite>The Autobiography of FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes</cite>, from back around the time of the original broadcast; and Mark Frost’s more recent <cite><a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/03/the-secret-of-twin-peaks-by-mark-frost-books-2017-1/">The Secret History of Twin Peaks</a></cite> and <cite><a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/02/27/twin-peaks-the-final-dossier-by-mark-frost-books-2018-4/">Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier</a></cite>, which I’ve written about here.</p>
<p>But Horton argues that the whole story gets kicked off in <cite>Eraserhead</cite>, and that <cite>Blue Velvet</cite>, <cite>Lost Highway</cite>, <cite>Mulholland Dr</cite> and <cite>Inland Empire</cite> are side stories related to the main branch. The overall story being about an eternal being, The Dreamer, who dreams reality into existence, and also creates another being, known as Jowday, or Judy, who becomes his adversary. BOB, the possessing spirit of the original <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, is a creation of this entity, and the Black and White Lodges are the vanguards in the battle between the two beings.</p>
<p>Sure, on one level it’s just good vs evil, heaven &amp; hell — “just,” I say, as if that wasn’t enough. But the sheer scope of it is astonishing. The eighteen hours of <cite>The Return</cite> has been hailed as an incredible masterpiece of visual storytelling. But when you include all that I’ve listed above, and three of Lynch’s paintings to boot — it must be one of the greatest — in terms of size, at least — creative works by a single visionary. True, it’s far from being by a single <em>creator</em>, but the vision behind it is solely or primarily Lynch’s, or that of Lynch and Mark Frost.</p>
<p>And even if the connections to the other films are just in Horton’s head (and, to be fair, those of others whose work he acknowledges): the obviously-connected stuff is still amazing, and the current work, Horton’s book that I’m writing about, is something a of a creative triumph itself.</p>
<p>One that is slightly marred by its self-published nature and obvious lack of an editor — there are a <em>lot</em> of typos — but a hugely impressive one nonetheless.</p>
<p>Though obviously it’s only for the very serious <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> fan.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I had vaguely seen references to “ratios,” and was aware it was something to do with engagement on Twitter and elsewhere. But I hadn’t understood what exactly people meant by it. Then last night I saw a tweet in which someone said, “I accept I’ve been ratiod.” (Should the verb form rather be “ratioed”? Hard to say. Neither looks quite right.)</p>
<p>A search for understanding led me to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-ratio">this article on  Know Your Meme</a>.  It tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The Ratio refers to an unofficial Twitter law which states that if the amount of replies to a tweet greatly outnumbers the amount of retweets and likes, then the tweet is bad
</p></blockquote>
<p>and goes into some detail about the origin of the term.</p>
<p>It makes me sad to read that. Imagine an interaction system where, if people reply to something you say, that’s bad. Well, it seems we don’t have to imagine it: we can see it right here on the “social” web.</p>
<p>I like to get replies on Twitter or elsewhere. A reply means, to me, that someone has read what I’ve written, thought about it, and found it worth responding to. I’m aware that I speak from a position of some privilege, in that I’m not in a group that is likely to experience the mass abuse that many do. But something has broken down in our systems of interaction if getting replies mean what you said “is bad.”</p>
<p>I’m far from the first to have made that observation, of course.</p>
<p>But consider <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, the still-young social network based on blogs that I’ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/02/02/success-for-micro-blog/">written abut before</a>. Micro.blog has replies, but it doesn’t even have the concept of likes or retweets/reblogs. If you read a post and want to say something about it — even just that you like it — you have to reply. With words, in human language.</p>
<p>It’s a much friendlier place than Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="https://eli.li/2019/06/18/i-know-there-are-some-ham-radio-folks-on-the-indieweb-and-adjacent-so-im-passing-along-this-question">This conversation</a> from the last day or two gives a good flavour of the kind of thing you can expect.</p>
<p>If you clicked through that link you’ll have seen that it appears to be — and is — on the blog of the user who made the original post. The responses appear as blog comments. But while every Micro.blog user has a blog, you don’t have to interact with it <em>as</em> a blog if you don’t want to. You can do it all through the Micro.blog app or one of the third-party clients, or just the Micro.blog website, where <a href="https://micro.blog/eli/4107886">you can see the same conversation</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can <a href="https://micro.blog/devilgate">see all my posts here</a>, as well as at their <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/">natural home</a>.</p>
<p>It’s well worth a try if you’re looking for a less toxic social-media environment.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Back when the internet was young — or at least the commercial, available-at-home internet — I sent an email with the  subject line, “Bicycle on the Superhighway”. It was about me having a publicly-accessible email address for the first time since uni (as opposed to one that was only usable within the company where I worked at the time).</p>
<p>This was back when people — inspired, if I recall correctly, by Al Gore — were calling the net the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_superhighway">Information Superhighway</a>.”</p>
<p>This post is not about all that, though; this is about literal cycling on a literal superhighway: specifically London’s “<a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/routes-and-maps/cycle-superhighways">Cycle Superhighways</a>.”</p>
<p>Since the building where I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/05/08/new-job-obtained/">now work</a> has showers, I decided it was time to get back on the bike. And since it’s in Westminster, it turns out there’s a really easy route, that uses CS6 and CS3: down Farringdon Road and west along Embankment, by the river.</p>
<p>These are fantastic cycling facilities, especially the Embankment one. Properly separated from the motor traffic, plenty of room to move and overtake, great sequencing of traffic lights so you hardly have to stop. It’s hard to fault it. Especially compared to nearly every other pathetic painted cycle lane in the city.</p>
<p>It gets a bit hairy where it all ends, in Parliament Square: the traffic there is unfeasibly heavy. Who drives near parliament?</p>
<p>If there’s a downside to it all, it’s this: I suspect that the motorised traffic is busier and faster, exactly because it’s not tempered by having bikes in the mix. I can’t be sure — I’ve never used Embankment before, and it’s years since I used to cycle regularly on Farringdon Road — but it feels to me that there’s a crazy amount of traffic and that it’s going faster than ever.</p>
<p>The latter can’t really be true — there are still speed limits, and they either won’t have changed or might have dropped to 20 mph in sections. But I still get this sense that, freed from interacting with the fragile two-wheeled minority, the armoured legions behave more like they’re on a motorway.</p>
<p>Whether that’s the case or not, the number of people cycling — especially in the recent bright spring weather — is huge. The only time I’ve seen more cyclists together was when I did the London to Brighton ride many years ago.</p>
<p>And also in the mix now are electric scooters and electric skateboards, which makes it all the more interesting. There’s even the odd cycle rickshaw.</p>
<p>It’ll be interesting to see how the volume changes with the seasons, but you can’t beat it for a way to commute: it’s faster than the tube, it saves you money, and you get some exercise. I recommend it for anyone who’s able.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Yesterday I started my new job. It all came about very quickly in the end: it’s not even a month since I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/04/12/job-changing/">finished at SAHSU</a>. And I didn’t really start hunting in earnest until then. In fact I had two offers to choose from, which was nice. I turned down Capgemini, a massive consultancy, in the hope that the smaller one, whose offer I did accept, would feel more comfortable, more human-scale.</p>
<p>Though they do have some massive clients.</p>
<p>You’ll note that I’m not naming the company. That’s because the staff handbook makes it quite clear that they don’t want us to do so. I guess they don’t want the company name linked with arbitrary random sites on the web. I mean, we all know <em>I’d</em> be fine, but you never know what someone might say.</p>
<p>Here’s how good they are though: in a company full of PCs, when I said I preferred to work on a Mac, they said, “No problem,” and ordered one in for me. I’ve just been setting it up today. 15-inch MacBook Pro, 2018 model. Lovely. Much like my own one, though mine’s a 2017 model and Space Grey, rather than silver.</p>
<p>Not much more to report yet. I’m looking forward to getting my teeth into some projects.</p>

<p>Today I got an email from “This Time I’m Voting,” containing the following text:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If you are one of the 3.5 million EU nationals still living here in the UK<br>
  …<br>
  Therefore, whether you are British or an EU citizen<br>
  …
</p></blockquote>
<p>Last time I looked there are around 67 million EU nationals living in the UK. At least until next week, and hopefully for a long time after that. I mean, that’s kind of the point of this whole struggle we’re having, isn’t it?</p>
<p>The fact that  (some) people in the UK fail to identify as EU citizens is partly what has got us into this mess.</p>

			 <html><body><p>The other day I was explaining to my daughter why I thought a second referendum would be right and democratic. I reached for an analogy, and came up with the idea that you don’t (usually) do something as serious as deleting a file without getting a confirmation dialogue to confirm that you really mean to go ahead.</p>
<p>So now I’m planning on making a banner with some version of the image below for the “<a href="https://www.peoples-vote.uk">Put it to the People</a>” march on Saturday. Just trying to perfect the wording. All suggestions gratefully considered.</p>

<p>We went to Parliament Square this morning for the passing into law of <a href="http://equalcivilpartnerships.org.uk">Equal Civil Partnerships</a> (the <a href="https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2017-19/civilpartnershipsmarriagesanddeathsregistrationetc.html">Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registrations etc)</a> bill — or now, act — to give it its full name).</p>
<p>It has taken a long time, but different-sex couples can now have a civil partnership if they want to. Or will be able to, later this year or early next, once all the paperwork has been processed.</p>
<p>It’s not the biggest issue in the world — it wasn’t even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/15/its-our-time-to-rise-up-youth-climate-strikes-held-in-100-countries">the most important thing happening in Parliament Square this morning</a> (those kids were noisy, and rightly so) — but it means a lot to us. Those of us who have problems with traditional marriage. Which just means that it isn’t right for <em>us</em>; it’s up to everyone else what’s right for them.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/rebecca-charles.jpeg" alt="Rebecca Steinfeld &amp; Charles Keidan" <figcaption>Rebecca &amp; Charles Addressing the crowd</figcaption></figure>
<p>Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who took the case to the court, and ultimately the Supreme Court, were there, as was Tim Loughton, the Liberal Democrat MP whose private members bill it was. The government supported it, which is why it was able to get through; but of course they had to do something once the Supreme Court had told them that the existing situation was unlawful.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/tim-loughton.jpeg" alt="Tim Loughton MP"<figcaption>Tim Loughton MP addressing the crowd</figcaption></figure>
<p>The stupid thing is that all the time and money and stress could have been saved if civil partnerships had included mixed-sex couples in the first place. I was sure I’d had this thought back when they were introduced for same-sex couples. I thought I had written about it here. Not much, it turns out. There was <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/02/21/civil-disappointment/">a post expressing disappointment with a setback at the Supreme Court</a> before the final decision.</p>
<p>But there was <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2007/05/11/new-dawn-fades/">this post about Tony Blair’s legacy</a>, where I said in an aside, “though why not for het couples?”</p>
<p>I took a few pictures. Did you know there’s a statue of Abraham Lincoln in Parliament Square? I didn’t. Seems rather strange, but why not, I suppose.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/lincoln-parliament.jpeg" alt="Statue of Abraham Lincoln in Parliament Square" <figcaption>Statue of Abraham Lincoln in Parliament Square</figcaption></figure>

<p>Since I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/31/5196/">announced back in October</a> that I’m writing a novel called <cite>Delta Blues: Beat Poet of the Spaceways</cite>, I thought I should learn a bit more about the Beats. Not that my character is necessarily going to be very like the actual Beats, and maybe her poetry won’t be like theirs either, but you need to know about what you’re using for inspiration, right?</p>
<p>Books in the “Very Short Introduction” series do exactly what their shared subtitle suggests, and this is no exception. You get a brief prehistory and history of the movement, then a look at the major novelists, another at the major poets, and then a piece on their influence.</p>
<p>In common with the <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/02/01/we-are-the-clash-by-mark-andersen-and-ralph-heibutzki-books-2019-2/">last</a> two <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/02/25/englands-dreaming-the-sex-pistols-and-punk-rock-by-jon-savage-books-2019-3/">books</a> I read, The Clash get a mention, because Allen Ginsberg worked with them, adding spoken-word part to “Ghetto Defendant,” on the <cite>Combat Rock</cite> album.</p>
<p>I know more about the Beats now than when I started, and that’s exactly what I wanted out of this book.</p>

</figure>
<p>I didn’t start reading this just because I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/02/01/we-are-the-clash-by-mark-andersen-and-ralph-heibutzki-books-2019-2/">read a book about The Clash recently</a>. In fact I started it sometime last year. But reading the Clash book did make me want to get back to this, and refresh my memories of the early days of punk.</p>
<p>Reading a history of a time you lived through is interesting. Not that I was involved in the events, but I was distantly aware of at least some of them. In the years the book covers I was between 12 and 15. Or maybe just 14, as it only gets as far as early 79. It’s a short period of time, looking back, and they — the Pistols, and most of the other bands too — were incredibly young. They were just 20 and 21 when they signed their first deal. And their second. And their third.</p>
<p>At times Savage appears to think that punk was over when the pistols split, if not before. And generally to have quite negative thoughts about it as it developed Though he undercuts that contempt later, in the appendices and in the notes scattered through the huge discography at the end. He acknowledges the influence of punk, though considers it just to be one of a range of genres or forms that influences popular music. Which is fair enough, though there are still, even today, bands that consider themselves to be punk. Whether that’s a good thing or not, I don’t know.</p>
<p>Something that came out of it that surprised me — though doesn’t, now that I know the facts — is that you can no longer get the film of <cite>The Great Rock ‘n’ Roll Swindle</cite> in any form (though you can still get the soundtrack album). That’s because it was McLaren’s project, it sets him up as hero, and makes Lydon the almost-unseen villain. Lydon hated McLaren by the end, and eventually won control of the Sex Pistols name and assets in a series of court cases. Presumably he controls whether it will ever be released.</p>
<p>I find this mildly annoying, because I saw it couple of times when I was a student, and enjoyed it, and wouldn’t mind seeing it again. Second-hand DVD copies are available, but they’re mostly pricey and/or being shipped from the States.</p>
<p>I suppose the more recent, documentary film, <cite>The Filth and the Fury</cite>, might be worth seeing. I see that, like <cite>The Swindle</cite>, it is directed by Julien Temple. Clearly Lydon didn’t mind <em>his</em> work on McLaren’s film.</p>
<p>What doesn’t come through very much is any sense of Jon Savage himself. What was he doing, and how did he get involved in all this? I gather he wrote a fanzine, <cite>London’s Outrage</cite>, and he became a journalist writing for <cite>Sounds</cite>, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Savage">his Wikipedia entry</a>. While he has done extensive research, and interviewed many of the participants, some of the story clearly comes from his being there at the time.</p>
<p>But the only real sense of that we get is that, towards the last third or so of the book, a series of dated, italicised entries appear. They clearly are — or are meant to be — diary entries from the time. Or notes for articles he wrote at the time, perhaps, giving us something of a first-person view of some to the gigs and so on. I would have liked to see more made of these, or more generally about his experience and from his point of view. A book about punk ought to be a bit more gonzo, I think.</p>
<p>But on the whole it’s a great read.</p>

			 <html><body><p>You could spend a lot of time wondering what makes Theresa May tick.</p>
<p>She says she supported remain and voted to stay in the European Union. So her increasing fervour for Brexit has been one of the most confusing factors in British politics over the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>Taking over the Tory leadership after David Cameron resigned was always going to be a poisoned chalice. No-one would have had a good time in that position, except maybe a genuine hard quitter like Jacob Rees-Mogg. That’s probably why Gove and Johnson pulled out.</p>
<p>If she truly believed that staying in was best, though, she would not have rushed into triggering Article 50 (nor would she have gone to court to fight for her wish to do so by diktat; luckily National Hero Gina Miller had the nation’s back on that one).</p>
<p>If she had used more care, collaboration, and consideration, she might have had an easier time when Article 50 finally was triggered and the negotiations started. In fact if she had been more thoughtful in the first place she might even have said something like, “The vote was close; the country is clearly divided. We will discuss the possible ways forward in parliament and with the rest of the EU, and come back to you, the people, for confirmation when we better understand what Brexit means.” <sup id="fnref-5415-brexitmeans"><a href="#fn-5415-brexitmeans" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But no: “Brexit means Brexit”: she knew up front what it meant, and never deviated. Even if the majority of the country had no idea what it would mean.</p>
<p>She then proceeded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>ignore any idea of cross-party talks and so involving parliament (the UK’s sovereign body) in the negotiations;</li>
<li>trigger Article 50 as soon as she could;</li>
<li>negotiate with the EU27 almost in secret;</li>
<li>have inflexible “red lines” to appease the hard quitters, leaving herself no room for compromise in the negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a truism, even a cliche, to say that she puts the Tory party before the country. But the only way I can explain such a dramatic change of heart is that her love for the Tory party overruled her knowledge that being in the EU was, is, and will be the best situation for the UK. And that she somehow convinced herself that she could heal her fatally-divided party.</p>
<p>In fact, the very thing that Cameron was trying to do by calling he referendum in the first place.</p>
<p>“Tory eurosceptics” used to be a common enough phrase, but it denoted a tiny fringe of the party: a few loons like John Redwood. But in trying to appease them, two Tory leaders and prime ministers have turned them mainstream and brought us to where we are today, on the brink of leaving the EU without any kind of agreement for our future relationship.</p>
<p>And their party is as divided as ever.</p>

<p>This is the book that I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/12/22/clash-book-with-me-in-it/">mentioned before Christmas</a>. The subtitle is “Reagan, Thatcher, and the Last Stand of A Band That Mattered,”<sup id="fnref-5409-oxford"><a href="#fn-5409-oxford" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> which captures well its structure. It interleaves the politics of what was happening on both sides of the Atlantic — the miners’ strike, Reagan’s nuclear brinksmanship, the Iran/Contra scandal — with what was happening with the most political of the original punk bands.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to read a history of a time you lived through and were, however tangentially, involved in. Andersen and Heibutzki more than do justice to their material. The research they must have done is impressive. I know personally that Andersen came to the UK on a research trip, but aside from that they have interviewed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Howard">three</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Sheppard">non-original</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_White">members</a> of The Clash, <a href="https://kosmovinyl.com/">Kosmo Vinyl</a>, and various other people who were involved or just had something useful to say.</p>
<p>And they must have spent a lot of time listening to concert tapes and studying set lists — which doesn’t sound like a chore to me, it’s fair to say.</p>
<p>I learned two major things: first, I’d forgotten how good <cite>Cut the Crap</cite> is. I haven’t listened to it in ages, and when I went to do so on Apple Music, I found it isn’t there. Nor is it on Spotify. I have it on vinyl, but I don’t currently have access to a record player.</p>
<p>Luckily Amazon and CDs both still exist, so I put some more money the way of… <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Rhodes">Bernie Rhodes</a>, as it turns out.</p>
<p>That’s the other big thing I found out: how — <em>difficult</em>, let’s say — Rhodes was. Not least since he signed the band — well, Joe and Paul: the others were effectively employees — into a contract that gave him, Rhodes, control over the album, as well as the name “The Clash.”</p>
<p>But worse was the way he treated the new members while they were with the band. Constantly haranguing them, telling them they weren’t up to scratch, shouting at them… it’s a wonder they stayed. It sounds like an abusive environment.</p>
<p>Joe could and should have stopped it, but it seems like he was still to some extent in Rhodes’s thrall — Bernie did bring the band together, after all — and possible suffering from depression. Certainly he was drinking heavily, and during that time his dad died and his mum got ill, and he became a father himself. It was a difficult time for him.</p>
<p>I have more to say about the album, but I think that’s for a separate post. For now, this is a great rock book about a little-discussed time in the history of my favourite band.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Suppose your family lives in a flat that’s rented from a housing association. And you have come to feel (rightly or wrongly) that it’s not a very nice flat, and that the association interferes too much. So you discuss it as a family, and you think about all the lovely houses out there that you could live in, and eventually you decide to leave. So far, so good.

<p>I’m pleased to have finished the first book of the year — and the first of my Christmas books — already. It’s a book about travel, and the human body, and some people and things that happen to them. Is it  a novel? It consists of a series of short sections, and a few longer ones. I can’t really call them chapters: some are no more than a paragraph, even a sentence. It does have characters, though: notably the narrator, who is the voice of most of the shorter sections. She appears to be someone who spends most of her life travelling around the world without necessarily any destination or purpose in mind.</p>
<p>That doesn’t make it sound as compelling as it is. There are connections between at least some of the stories, which make me think there must be more connections that I missed. A lot of it regards the preservation of dead bodies, from early embalming techniques to the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Worlds">Body Worlds</a>” plastination of Gunther von Hagens.</p>
<p>In the end it doesn’t quite form a unified whole, so in that sense I’m not sure we can really call it a novel. But it’s strangely compelling, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>

			 <html><body><p>When I was writing <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/01/04/italian-coffee-is-the-best/">that last post</a> I was confused because I couldn’t copy text from the article I was linking to.</p>
<p>Clicking and moving my mouse across the text did nothing: there was no indication that I had selected anything. Similarly, double-clicking on a single word didn’t select it.</p>
<p>Eventually I saved the article to Instapaper, and copied from there</p>
<p>After initially posting it, I noticed that the URL contained the string “<code>amphtml</code>”. I removed the <code>amphtml/</code>, and the page worked normally.</p>
<p>AMP is Google’s “accelerated mobile pages,” a way for them to control URLs instead of the owners controlling them. At least, that’s how it appeared at first. Clearly that can’t be the case for a page like this that’s purely at the Washington Post’s own site.</p>
<p>But it’s a bloody annoying state of affairs, and makes for a very bad web citizen.</p>

Not least for the closing quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It’s not that Italian coffee has always been bad,” Campeotto said. “They have been geniuses. The god of coffee is the Italian espresso. The problem is, they have been stuck there. They stopped.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>If they had already achieved the “god of coffee” (which I happen to agree with), then why would they do anything <em>other</em> than stop? If you’ve already achieved perfection you have no need to improve. Just make sure you maintain that level.</p>
<p>I spent twelve months of 1989-90 in Turin. A cappuccino was 1200 lire, or about 60p (around 45-50 US cents, probably). And it was <em>delicious</em>. The best coffee I had, or have, ever tasted.</p>
<p>The growth of Starbucks and the other chains came after that, and I’ve been looking for coffee as good ever since. I’ve never found it. The closest I ever found in London was Costa in its early days. It has slipped down to the level of Starbucks and Caffè Nero, though.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that any of those are truly <em>bad</em>: not, at least, compared to what was available before they came on the scene.</p>
<p>But nothing matches my memory of Torinese cappuccino.</p>

<p>Then I realise it’s “one who binges.” There’s no obvious way in written English to specify which of the two pronunciations you mean. You’d have to write “binge-er” or something. Not ideal.</p>
<p>You’d have thought someone in the marketing team would have spotted the potential confusion and suggested taking a different tack. But then again, maybe they did, and they thought that the momentary confusion would draw people’s attention and make them notice the poster.</p>
<p>Which clearly worked.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Right, let’s get 2019 off to a start by talking about my favourite TV programme. I haven’t said anything about the recent season of <cite>Doctor Who</cite> here since my <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/07/5050/">appreciative post</a> at the end of the first episode. Not for any reason other than not getting round to it.</p>
<p>I absolutely love this iteration of the series. Jodie Whittaker is fantastic as The Doctor, and the supporting cast is brilliant as well. I like the crowded Tardis feel. It does have the limitation that some of the characters don’t get as much time or as many lines as others. That’s been notably true of Yaz — except in the “Demons of the Punjab” episode, of course.</p>
<p>But there’s plenty of time for her to be developed further, assuming they’re all sticking around. And the focus being more on Ryan and Graham was entirely correct, since if there was an overarching theme to the season, it was grief.</p>
<p>It’s not perfect. There have been several occasions when I’ve thought that the writing team don’t really understand what a galaxy is, or the scale of it. Lines like “half the people in the galaxy are unemployed,” or “they’ve crossed four galaxies to get here,” just don’t really make a lot of sense. And there have been several episodes where things maybe weren’t as tidily resolved as we’re used to.</p>
<p>Tonight’s New Year special episode, “Resolution,” was a classic example of the kind of story where the ideas are good, but the whole thing could have been improved if they’d taken the time to come up with slightly better ways to make things happen. Some way of defeating the enemy that didn’t involve the microwave oven, for example. And the whole vacuum/supernova bit at the end was kind of farcical.</p>
<p>But no matter. This season was all about the character dynamics, and those were great. It’s a strong start for Chris Chibnall as showrunner, and an incredibly strong start for Jodie Whittaker.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Hey, I made it to 31, by reading the last chapter of this on the last day of the year.</p>
<p>This book, subtitled “Inside Apple’s Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,” is written by the software engineer who worked on the original version of the iPhone’s software keyboard. It’s an interesting view into how things were for someone working at Apple at the time.</p>
<p>That’s not something we often get, with the company’s noted dedication to secrecy, so it’s good for that. But while I did get a sense of what it was like, I feel that there’s an awful lot more he could tell, especially about the people. We do get a sense of some of them, but not much insight. And especially not about he author himself. We learn next to nothing about him outside of his work.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s the way you have to be when you work at somewhere as high-pressure as Apple. Worth a read if you’re interested in Apple and their products.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I don’t always include all comic-type things here. No particular reason why, except maybe that they sometimes feel too short and not substantial enough. I probably wouldn’t have included this, except that it conveniently gets my total for the year to thirty.</p>
<p>It’s a post-<cite>Watchmen</cite> story of superheroes handled in a vaguely realist fashion. At least in the sense that there’s some consideration of politics. Stormwatch is a UN body, an emergency response team. It has its base in a satellite, and superhuman beings who are tasked with dealing with incursions from other worlds, or other, nefarious, super-powered beings. The US is usually antagonistic to it, because of its UN status.</p>
<p>It’s not bad, but honestly not much to write home about.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I think I’ve read this more times than any other book except <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/04/10/the-illuminatus-trilogy-by-robert-shea-and-robert-anton-wilson-books-2018-7/"><cite>Illuminatus!</cite></a>, and maybe <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>. Which may be only three or four times. A friend got into Michener when we were teenagers. None of his books much interested me, until I looked at this.</p>
<p>It’s a tale of hippies and others in 1969. Six young people from various countries meet each other in Torremolinos, and drift around the Iberian Peninsula and parts of Africa. The narrator, seemingly detached third-person at first, turns out to be an older man who knows some of the young people, and arranges business trips so that he can hang out with them from time to time.</p>
<p>It’s about what was going on in the world — Vietnam, the Arab/Israeli conflict, drugs, music — and about the characters. They aren’t that well developed — indeed, he largely abandons character development after the first six chapters where he introduces each one — but those introductions are enough to see us through.</p>
<p>Actually, thinking about it now, I wish he had written more about some of them. A sequel would have been in order.</p>
<p>It’s partly, I suspect, Michener’s own struggle to come to terms with the way society is changing — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Michener">he was born in 1907</a>, so he’d have been 62 at the time this is set. It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drifters_(novel)">published in 71</a>, so maybe a tad older when he wrote it. The narrator, George Fairbanks, is younger than that, I think — probably in his fifties, maybe even forties, but people seemed to become old at a younger age back then.</p>
<p>Well worth a read.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Joe Strummer <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2002/12/23/the-death-of-a-hero/">died</a> 16 years ago today. The Joe Strummer Foundation has <a href="https://joestrummerfoundation.org/remembering-joe-strummer-22-dec-2018/">a good memorial piece</a>.</p>
<p>But for me it’s amusing or ironic or something, that it should be today of all days that, out shopping, I see (and buy) this book:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/0B981C3A-7C3E-4BBB-A90E-92C075EA5C0E.jpeg"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/0B981C3A-7C3E-4BBB-A90E-92C075EA5C0E.jpeg" alt="" width="1536" height="2048" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5318"></a></p>
<p>I’ve been waiting for this for around five years. You’ll recall, I don’t doubt for a second, that back in 2013 I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2013/06/10/we-are-the-clash-the-last-stand-of-a-band-that-mattered-by-mark-andersen-ralph-heibutzki-kickstarter/">posted a link to a Kickstarter</a> that the authors were running to help them fund the writing of the book.</p>
<p>What I don’t seem to have posted about is that a year or so later, in June 2014, one of the authors visited the UK and interviewed me for the book. He didn’t come over just to interview me, I should stress. It was a research trip, and he visited various places and interviewed lots of people, some of my friends included.</p>
<p>We’ve exchanged emails a couple of times since then, when he had followup questions, so I kind of expected to hear when the book came out. Coincidentally I was recently thinking about emailing him, to talk about something on the <a href="https://joestrummerfoundation.org/joe-strummer-001-archive-release/"><cite>Joe Strummer 001</cite></a> collection of obscurities that came out a month or two back. Had I done so, I would of course have said, “So when’s the book coming out?”</p>
<p>But here it is. I am extensively quoted (well, quoted a couple of times) in the section on the <a href="https://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_clashs_forgotten_years_1984_1986">busking tour’s</a> visit to Edinburgh, which was mainly what he wanted me to talk about.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/we-are-the-clash/">Here’s the publisher’s page</a> on it. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36436604-we-are-the-clash">Here’s its GoodReads page</a>, and its <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clash-Reagan-Thatcher-Stand-Mattered/dp/1617752932">Amazon UK</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clash-Reagan-Thatcher-Stand-Mattered/dp/1617752932">US</a> links. Probably too late to get it for Christmas. Try a bookshop.</p>
<p>Here’s a page with me:</p>

			 <html><body><p>I expect you’re all wondering what happened with my NaNoWriMo attempt this year. Sadly, after <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/11/30/a-five-and-four-zeroes/">last year’s success</a>, this year <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/participants/devilgate/novels/delta-blues-beat-poet-of-the-spaceways/stats">I failed</a>.</p>
<p>As you’ll have seen if you clicked through to look at my stats, I averaged 595 words per day, for a total of 17,800. It’s not nothing, and it’s still a decent start on the new novel, but it’s nothing like last year.</p>
<p>Why did I fail? A better question is, why was I successful last year? This year’s result is comparable to other years when I’ve tried it. Last year’s success looks like the aberration.</p>
<p>The big difference between last year and any other was my commute. I’ve tended always to have a commute of about an hour — except when I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/02/recent-events-2/">worked at the bank in the City</a>, when it was shorter. Last year I was working in Croydon, which took me an hour and a half or more to get to. The one good point was that, picking up the Overground from Dalston Junction, I nearly always got a seat within a few stops. And on the way back had one from the start (coming from West Croydon, which is the start of the line).</p>
<p>So I was able to get forty or fifty minutes of concentrated writing time in each direction. Add to that the fact that the office I was in was really horrible, so I didn’t want to spend my lunch hours in it. I mostly went out and wrote in cafes or at <a href="https://www.boxpark.co.uk/croydon/">Boxpark Croydon</a>. The one thing I miss about that job is the the places to eat, especially a little pizza place in Boxpark.</p>
<p>Whereas now, working at Imperial, I’m back to a one-hour commute, with much less guarantee of a seat. And I really like both job and office, so I’m quite happy to go back there after I’ve got my lunch.</p>
<p>One other point is that last year I had worked out how I was going to end the novel I had been working on for years, so I was running downhill towards that end. This year, starting a brand-new one — even though I’ve got a plan, it feels much more uphill.</p>
<p>Still, we press on, writers against procrastination, borne forward ceaselessly into the future.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>I watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081441/"><cite>Rude Boy</cite></a> for the first time in many years. It is, in case you don’t know, a film from 1980 about and featuring The Clash. It’s kind of a fictionalised documentary, in that the titular character, Ray Gange, is both someone who was a sometime roadie for/hanger-on of The Clash, and playing the part of “Ray Gange.”<sup id="fnref-5250-Gange"><a href="#fn-5250-Gange" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The worst part of it is, as I recalled, his “acting.” Well, that’s not quite true. Viewing it <em>as a film</em>, that’s the case. But viewing it as a document of the end of the seventies, the worst part of it is the casual racism. And indeed the organised racism of the National Front rally shown at the start.</p>
<p>Also bad are the violence from police and bouncers, and the general horribleness of Britain in the seventies. Nothing looks clean, everything looks run-down or broken. It looks, in fact, far worse than I remember it being.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, by the way, if you don’t remember what it was like, are too young to have experienced it, and/or don’t want to watch the film. It’ll be like that again in a couple of years if things go as we fear.</p>
<p>The best parts are, of course, the scenes of The Clash live and in the studio. And we won’t get them back after Brexit.</p>
<p>Also, in looking up the IMDB article, I discover that a) Ray Gange has actually been in a couple of other movies, and b) far more importantly, there is a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081441/">2016 movie called <cite>London Town</cite></a>, which is a drama about those times. With people acting as The Clash. Whaaaat? Why did no-one tell me about this?</p>

<p>Wes Streeting:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Labour cannot sit by and allow the choice to be between the economic ruin of a hard Brexit or the loss of sovereignty under Theresa May’s deal, with Britain subjected to EU rules but with no say over them,” he said. “As with any fork in the road, there is always the option of turning back home.</p>
<p>  “We know this is a mess made by the Tories, but the Labour party can’t just sit back and watch. It’s time for all of us in the Labour party to make the full-throated case for a people’s vote with the option of remaining in the European Union.</p>
<p>  “That leadership must now come from the top, or our party may never be forgiven for the consequences that follow.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Chris Leslie:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With even Tory ministers recognising Brexit threatens the poorest in society, our public services and Britain’s place in the world, to have a Labour leader just shrug about it, then go awol, is nothing short of a dereliction of duty.”

			 <html><body><p>You know what? I’m done with Jeremy Corbyn. <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/interview-with-labour-leader-corbyn-we-can-t-stop-brexit-a-1237594.html">This interview in <cite>Der Spiegel</cite></a>, in which he says “Brexit can’t be stopped,” is the clincher.</p>
<p>As always, literally <em>everything else he says</em> is on the good side of politics — the side I tend to agree with, to be less judgmental. But he refuses to resist — even, really, to engage with<sup id="fnref-5198-march"><a href="#fn-5198-march" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> — the thing that is the most important political issue and biggest political mistake of our lifetime (setting aside for the moment climate change, which is not just a political issue, and is global in scope, not just European). Look at this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Not just Labour, but the whole country is extremely divided at the moment — not least because of Brexit. If you could stop Brexit, would you?</p>
<p>  <strong>Corbyn:</strong> We can’t stop it. The referendum took place. Article 50 has been triggered. What we can do is recognize the reasons why people voted Leave.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is that “will of the people” nonsense, the idea that it would be undemocratic to ask again. The will of the people can change, and almost certainly has. And you don’t agree to a deal with going back and checking that it’s still OK. Having a confirmatory referendum would be considerably <em>more</em> democratic than not having one.<sup id="fnref-5198-cut"><a href="#fn-5198-cut" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> And we <em>can</em> stop it. Parliament, which is, and always was, sovereign, could revoke Article 50.</p>
<p>Back to the interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’ve been critical of the competitions policy in Europe and the move towards free market, and obviously critical in the past of their treatment of Greece, although that was mostly the eurozone that did that. My idea is of a social Europe with inclusive societies that work for everyone and not just for a few.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You don’t build a “social Europe with inclusive societies that work for everyone and not just for a few” by leaving the EU! You build it by staying in, and working to build that society! God, it’s infuriating.</p>
<p>I voted for him as leader, I respect and believe in most of his policies, but he needs to go. Labour won three general elections under Tony Blair, and was able to do a lot of good. They could have done more, they could have been better, and Blair destroyed his legacy by throwing his lot in with George W Bush and the Iraq War. But those were times when things were improving in the country and we looked to the future with positivity. It can be like that again.</p>
<p>But it won’t — for decades at least — if we destroy our economy, hobble worker’s rights, and undercut food-safety regulations, by leaving the EU.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I think I’ve read this twice before, but as ever, my memories of it are not strong enough to support that thought. Doesn’t really matter. I read it years back and loved it. When I started it this time, at first I wasn’t so sure. It felt like it wasn’t living up to my memories. Maybe I was reading it for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>But there can be no wrong reason to read a book. Just sometimes you’ve got to be in the right mood for a particular one; or it needs to be the right book for you at that time.</p>
<p>Luckily reading changes us. So we might be in the wrong mood at first, but the book brings us around. That’s what happened this time.</p>
<p>I wish MMS would go back to writing SF. I suppose his crime/horror fiction as Michael Marshall (the second-most transparent pseudonym in literary history) is more lucrative — and to be fair, maybe he enjoys it more, or just as much. But <em>god</em>, it feels like a loss to SF.</p>
<p>Anyway, this was a mighty debut, but thinking about it now, it’s actually more like magical realism than SF. There’s no attempt to explain Jeamland or how the narrator and others get to it.</p>

			 <html><body><h2>Numbers</h2>
<p>After the <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/07/15/trumping-through-london/">Trump thing earlier in the year</a>, another walk through London on Saturday just past. This time with over half a million people — 770,000, by some estimates. That’s a hugely impressive number, and a measure of the strength of feeling in the country against Brexit. Or at least against the idea of the government pushing it through without us having another say on the matter.</p>
<p>You’d imagine it might be enough to make them at least consider enquiring as to the will of the people. But I highly doubt it.</p>
<h2>The March</h2>
<p><a href="/images/2018/10/IMG_2248.jpeg"><img src="/images/2018/10/IMG_2248.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Arriving at Green Park Station" title="Arriving at Green Park Station"></img></a></p>
<p>A group of us from Hackney joined at Green Park. There’s an exit from Green Park station that comes out in the park itself, which I don’t think I knew before.Then it took us an age to get out of the park, because of the crush a t the gate. Quite a lot of people were trying to get in at the same time, which didn’t help.</p>
<p>We milled around on Piccadilly for a while. The main march started on Park Lane, so we were ahead of it, and it wasn’t clear to us whether the head of it had already passed us, or if not, then when it actually reached us. It looked like nothing was moving ahead of us. My assumption was that they hadn’t yet closed all the roads between us and Parliament Square, but there was no way to know for sure. Eventually we started moving.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2018/10/IMG_2262.jpeg"><img src="/images/2018/10/IMG_2262.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="These noisy bastards were around all day"></img></a></p>
<p>The mood was universally peaceful and cheerful. There were hardly any police to be seen.</p>
<p>I tried to post a couple of photos, but inevitably the network was swamped and nothing would work. I guess even if people weren’t trying to post, just that many phones trying to register with a cell tower would slow things down dramatically.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2018/10/IMG_2265.jpeg"><img src="/images/2018/10/IMG_2265.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="An idea of the numbers"></img></a></p>
<h2>The Rally</h2>
<p>By the time we got to Whitehall Parliament Square was full, and we couldn’t get in. The organisers had set up some big screen-and-speaker systems, so we could hear the speeches (at least when the hovering helicopters weren’t too close).</p>
<p><a href="/images/2018/10/IMG_2299.jpeg"><img src="/images/2018/10/IMG_2299.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Wee Nicola on screen"></img></a></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There isn’t one, really. Like I say, the Mayhemic leadership of the country won’t pay any attention. But if nothing else it helps to keep our spirits up in these dark days.</p>

<p>Santiago is in the foothills of the Andes, at 500m above sea level, so mountains are all around it:</p>

<p>Though it’s hard to tell the mountains from the clouds in that first one.</p>
<p>But there’s a hill in the city itself, big enough to have both a funicular and a cable car. We went up one and down the other.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is five volumes of graphic novel that I read over a period of about a month or so, and — OK, you know how we all thought that <cite>Watchmen</cite> is Moore’s <em>magnum opus</em>, at least in comic terms?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>We were wrong. <cite>Promethea</cite> is the best thing Moore has done, by some margin.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, of course.</p>
<p>The character Promethea is sort of a personification of the human imagination. She has manifested through various women in history, called from the <em>immateria</em> into the “real” world by an artist — usually unknowingly, at least at first — when she is needed.</p>
<p>There are, of course, forces ranged against her, from demons to the FBI. The Earthbound part of the action takes place in a sort of alternative comic-book New York, where there are “science heroes” like the Five Swell Guys.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>University student Sophie Bangs is writing a term paper on the recurrence of the character of Promethea through myth and literature and comics, when she is attacked by a mysterious shadowy entity. A version of Promethea turns up to help her, and… well, read it and see.</p>
<p>And as well as the storytelling, the art is incredible, with some wildly challenging layouts; but it never gets in the way of the story. It is <em>magnificent</em>, spanning all of fiction and myth and religion and magic, and reminding us that those are all the same thing. Looked at one way, anyhow.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This morning I saw a poster for <cite>Heathers: The Musical</cite>. Err, What?</p>
<p>I rewatched <cite>Heathers</cite> fairly recently and I thought, this could never get made today. I figured teenage suicide is too high-profile, and the facts of people being driven to it, and the fear of copycatting — these would put a treatment of it like the one in <cite>Heathers</cite> off the table today.</p>
<p>Yet there’s a musical version playing in the West End, apparently.</p>
<p>Not that you can’t make a musical about serious subjects. I’ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/09/18/5022/">just been to see one about the founding of the USA</a>, after all. But <cite>Heathers</cite> is not what you’d call <em>sensitive</em> about the subject. It could have been changed significantly for the musical, of course, but to remove that aspect would be to take out an important part of the story, so I don’t know where they’d go with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathers:_The_Musical">Turns out</a> that it’s been around since <em>2014</em>; and that there’s a even a “High-School Edition,” made more suitable for kids.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it seems there’s a TV series based on the film as well, so what do I know? But it makes me wonder if I’m remembering a different film.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I didn’t really know what to expect with this. I knew it was about, or set around, a party — in part because I’ve seen <cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274558/">The Hours</a></cite>.</p>
<p>But it’s about so much more; and not really about the party very much at all. It’s an intriguing look at the mental lives of a range of people in London on a day in the 1920s. Not a very wide range of people, in that they’re all very much upper-middle to upper class. There are a few people from what would have been called the lower classes, but they’re just passersby, background colour. There is, however, a sympathy towards all people — from at least some of the characters.</p>
<p>Given the limited range of types of people, we get a remarkably effective insight into their mental lives. And it’s all done with reported thought. There is some actual dialogue, but very little. And we jump around from head to head promiscuously, but incredibly smoothly. There’s usually some handoff: the current viewpoint character sees someone, and then we’re in that person’s head. Or they might just think about someone, and now we hear the other person’s thoughts.</p>
<p>I guess this, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce">Joyce</a>, is one of the originators of the stream of consciousness as a literary device. An  interesting thing to me is how it reminded me of other, later, works; which of course shows its influence. Most noticeable: <cite><a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/04/10/the-illuminatus-trilogy-by-robert-shea-and-robert-anton-wilson-books-2018-7/">Illuminatus</a>!</cite> Now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a> was a Joyce scholar, so he was probably coming more from that direction, but there are definitely some similarities of style, or at least echoes.</p>
<p>And — also from this year’s rereading — <cite><a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/08/01/walking-on-glass-by-iain-banks-books-2018-18/">Walking On Glass</a></cite>. Especially in the contrast between the thoughts of people who are or are not “sane.”</p>
<p>It can be surprisingly confusing at times, such as when someone suddenly thinks  of a person or an idea that hasn’t been mentioned before. But that just simulates the way our minds work. Our thoughts jump from topic to topic without an introductory paragraph, after all.</p>
<p>So it’s psychology, feminism, and a critique of (parts of) the British class system. Oh, and it’s also partly a love-letter to London. I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I don’t know where I learned about this. It’s been sitting on my Kindle for a while. I have a feeling that a friend recommended it on Facebook. It’s subtitled “An Hallucinated Oral History of the Post-Punk Scene in Airdrie, Coatbridge and Environs 1978–1986,” which annoys me, but only because of that “<strong>An</strong> Hallucinated.” Not because it’s a subtitle. I like subtitles.</p>
<p>And this subtitle describes its book extremely well, especially with respect to that incorrectly-articled vision. It’s the fictionalised biography of a band called Memorial Device. Or at least that’s partly what it is. It verges on magic realism at times. It’s presented as a series of interviews and parts written by other contributors (as opposed to the supposed author, “Ross Raymond”). The actual author does a fine job of presenting those different voices and making them <em>sound</em> different. The whole thing reads like an actual music biography where the author has drawn on the experiences of a range of people as well as their own experience.</p>
<p>The hallucinatory part comes from the way some of those people speak, or write. They are variously damaged or otherwise otherworldly, and their mental strangeness comes across well — or is it the world that’s strange?</p>
<p>Airdrie is in the west of Scotland, not far from Glasgow, so it’s very much the same part of the world I grew up in. This feels very realistic: there was a similar swathe of bands inspired by punk and the post-punk/new wave/new romantic scene around Dumbarton and environs. None of the characters were as much larger-than-life as some of the members of Memorial Device — or at least not that I knew — but that’s why this is fictional, I guess.</p>
<p>Not the best thing I’ve read this, year, but not bad.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I’m not at all sure about this new “Gutenberg” editor they’re <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">adding to WordPress</a>. I’ve installed the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">plugin version</a> to try it out. Gutenberg is a change to the web-based editor in the WordPress dashboard, not a separate app. I typed up my <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/09/01/chile-trip-part-1-there-and-back/">previous post</a> in <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, as is my wont, and uploaded it. The Gutenberg plugin imported it nicely and displayed everything as you’d expect. But it turned all my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> into HTML.</p>
<p>That’s not what I want, and it’s not how most Markdown-processing plugins — notably WordPress’s own <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack</a> — handle Markdown. Instead they keep the source document as Markdown and only convert it to HTML when the page is requested. That’s what using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system">dynamic CMS</a> means, after all.</p>
<p>It appears that you can get Gutenberg to keep the Markdown as it is, if you type it into what they call a Code Block. So I’ll have to hope that <a href="http://micro.blog/danielpunkass">[@danielpunkass](https://micro.blog/danielpunkass)</a> updates MarsEdit to send posts to that kind of  block once Gutenberg is the default. Assuming the WordPress API lets you do that, of course.</p>

			 <html><body><p>We’re not long back from a family holiday to Chile. I plan to write several posts about it. I’m going to take a thematic approach, rather than a purely chronological or location-based one. Though some will be that kind, too. There will be pictures, but not so much in this post, as it’s about planes, airports, etc.</p>
<p>First, then, the whole business of travelling to another continent, and to the southern hemisphere of our amazing planet.</p>
<h2>Getting There</h2>
<p>We flew on Latin American Airlines, or LATAM. They were pretty good. I have no complaints. Maybe not as good as British Airways to New York a few years ago, but certainly much better than the budget airlines. The only thing was that we couldn’t get a direct flight. There just don’t seem to be any to Santiago. Though a taxi driver told us towards the end of our stay that BA have one direct flight a week. If so, then either we didn’t find it, it was on an inconvenient day, or it was really expensive. Or any combination of those.</p>
<p>So we had a multipart flight out: first to São Paulo, then on to Santiago via Rosario. That was just a stop at another airport, without leaving the plane. Though some confusion in the booking system meant that we had different seats for the second part. We were not alone: it was all a bit chaotic, as new people boarded and wanted to sit in already-occupied seats, as people who were staying on didn’t realise they had to move. Still, it got sorted out.</p>
<p>Also I didn’t realise till later that Rosario is actually in Argentina. It doesn’t count as visiting a country if you stay airside, but still, interesting to have touched down in two more countries than we planned to.</p>
<p>Above all, it’s a <em>long</em> journey. Around 6000 miles, and about 22 hours, if memory serves.</p>
<h2>Jet Lag</h2>
<p>We didn’t suffer too much from jet lag going out. Except… almost every day for the entire three weeks I woke up around 4 in the morning. Usually got back to sleep OK. Our clock-time confusion was confounded after about a week when the clocks in Chile went forward by an hour. It’s the tail end of winter there, so it’s the start of summer time. But it’s earlier than when clocks in Europe change, relatively. Also it was <em>only</em> Chile: in Bolivia and Brazil the time was unchanged.</p>
<h2>Taxis Home and Abroad</h2>
<p>While I’m on travel I’ll just touch on taxis. Chilean taxi drivers, in common with those all over Europe, get out of their car and help you load your bags into the boot. This happens everywhere; except Britain. Or at least, except London. When we were getting a cab when we were coming home I was struck by the fact that all these people were struggling into the stupidly-designed-for-luggage black cabs with no help from the driver.</p>
<p>And then I was ashamed when it was our turn, and the driver <em>did</em> get out and help us. But it’s uncommon.</p>
<h2>Internal Flights</h2>
<p>Chile is distinctive on the map for its length. It runs almost the entire length of the continent. So there are some long distances to travel if you want to see much of it. As it is, I couldn’t say that we saw <em>much</em> of it, but we did see some very distinctive areas. Notably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert">Atacama Desert</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Lagos_Region">Lakes region</a>.</p>
<p>They’re quite far apart, though, so we took some internal flights. All by LATAM (we should have signed up for their frequent-flyer programme), and all fine. Security at the airports was generally less intrusive than it is here. We didn’t have to take iPads out of carry-ons, and I once went through security with my metal water bottle full! Radical.</p>
<h2>Long(ish) Distance Buses</h2>
<p>The only other trip we took was from Santiago to Valparaíso, which was by bus (coach). A couple of hours. Very comfortable, if you could avoid hitting your head on the badly-designed overhead screens.</p>
<h2>Santiago Metro and Valparaíso Light Rail</h2>
<p>Santiago has a decent Metro system. You get a contactless card like London’s Oyster cards, called <em>Bip!</em>. Which is a great name, in my humble opinion. It also has the advantage over Oyster that you can make multiple journeys simultaneously with one card. So for a family of four, for example, you just put enough money on the card for everyone, and tap in four times.</p>
<p>I don’t really know why Oyster doesn’t support this. My only guess would be that they thought it would cause too many complaints with people accidentally being charged twice.</p>
<h2>Return</h2>
<p>Coming back took even longer: 23 hours in airports and planes, but 27, 28, if you count getting to and from the airports.</p>
<p>The weird thing here was that we flew from Santiago to Rio de Janeiro; then, after a four or five hour stopover, to São Paulo. An hour and a half there, and finally on to Heathrow. I don’t understand why it was like that, but as I recall it was the only available option when we booked the flights.</p>
<p>The annoying part was that — seemingly because the Rio – São Paulo bit was a domestic flight — we had to collect our luggage in Rio, and then check it back in. We went landside, got Brazilian entry stamps in our passports, all that.</p>
<p>We took off for Heathrow at 22:10, which made it 02:10 in the UK. So I wanted to get to sleep, but first I wanted to eat. On these long flights, though, they don’t rush to serve food like they do on a short European flight. So it was, I think, around 4 am before I could close my eyes.</p>
<p>Adjusting back home wasn’t too bad, though. People always say it’s worse coming east, but, apart from sleeping late on Bank Holiday Monday, I didn’t have too much trouble.</p>

			 <p>Also known as the <cite>Dark Gifts</cite> trilogy. I bought the first while at the <a href="https://bsfa.co.uk/july-2018-london-meeting-in-sound-vision/">recent BSFA meeting</a> where Vic James and  Lucy Hounsom, another fantasy author, interviewed each other. I enjoyed their conversation so much that I bought the first book in each of their trilogies.</p>
<p>I don’t read fantasy much, and I don’t really care for dystopias in SF, as I’ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2015/09/08/station-eleven-by-emily-st-john-mandel-books-2015-8/">mentioned before</a>. So this being a fantasy dystopia, it shouldn’t really appeal to me.</p>
<p>But it turns out it’s great.</p>
<p>Apparently it was pitched in jest as ‘<cite>Downton Abbey</cite> meets <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> in a world where Voldemort won.’  And… yeah, I guess. I haven’t read or seen <cite>Game of Thrones</cite>, and the time period is more-or-less present day. And none of the magical people (or Skilled ‘Equals’) is as out-and-out evil as Voldemort. But it’s not a bad description of the setup.</p>
<p>The idea is that there are people with magical abilities — referred to as ‘Skill’ — and they are the aristocracy and rule the country. Or at least they have been since Charles the First and Last was killed by one of the Skilled, and they — also known as ‘Equals,’ ironically — took over running the country. Britain is an ‘Equal Republic.’ One thing that annoyed me at first is that there is no mention of what happened to Scotland. It appears to be part of Britain in the present day, but Charles the First (in our reality) was before the Acts of Union. Although not before the Union of the Crowns, so I suppose the Equals just took over Scotland too, by getting rid of the monarchy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Anyway, the worst part about the rule of these magical Equals is ‘Slavedays,’ wherein everyone is required to spend ten years of their lives as slaves. They get some choice in when they do it, but while you’re doing it you’re a slave, with everything that implies.</p>
<p>I found it hard to cope with the idea that people would just quietly accept this state of affairs. But I suppose if it’s been that way all your life, and it’s the law of the land… But I couldn’t help but think, wouldn’t people revolt against it?</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, of course, a trilogy like this is <em>not</em> about the maintenance of the status quo.</p>
<p>It’s really good. Well worth a read.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/07/18/4909/">posted</a> about Anne Charnock’s Clarke win a few weeks back, and I’m pleased for her. But when I was about a third through this, I had a dawning realisation: this appeared not to be science fiction.  The Clarke Award being for the best <em>SF</em> novel of the year, of course.</p>
<p>At that point there were, to my reckoning, two things that don’t quite exist in the real world today: a self-driving car, and a kind of personal health sensor that can tell how much you drank last night, and if you’re pregnant. Neither is key to the plot or anything else, though.</p>
<p>There was also a hint that global warming has taken a turn for the worse. But it could just be a year with a bad crop, and anyway, that’s hardly fiction, never mind SF.</p>
<p>But then I hit part two, and it jumped forward 50 years, with corresponding technological advances. Part three takes us forward another fifty or so years.</p>
<p>So what we have is a series of vignettes about the experiences of several interlinked families, over a hundred or so years. It’s interesting enough, but it’s limited. It’s about families and the future of how humans conceive, bear (or not), and raise children. Which is fine. But there’s very little about what else is going on in the world, in society. Or even much about the societal effects of the technologies we <em>are</em> looking at. Yes, by the end there are reports of a visibly-pregnant woman being abused in public for giving her baby a bad start in life (by not using the artificial uterus technology and associated genetic cleansing). But that’s it.</p>
<p>It’s interesting enough, as far as it goes, but I’ve got to admit I’m surprised the judges considered it the best SF novel published in Britain in 2017.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>A novel of three parts. Two of them are — probably — tightly linked. By some interpretations, anyway. The third — which is the first as presented — brushes up against one of those two, and is to a small extent influenced by it. But in no way that I can discern is it really linked to the others. Which kind of makes me wonder what it’s for.</p>
<p>I mean, sure, maybe he just wanted to tell that story, with no more reason than that. That would be fine. But since the three are presented under one common title, I’ve got to assume that they share more than just a passing brush with simultaneous walks and some sugar in a tank.</p>
<p>The title itself is interesting. The only people who are literally walking on glass at any point are the two exiles from a galactic war in the far future (if that’s really what they are). But glass suggests fragility, slipperiness: maybe everyone is walking on glass, as everything could collapse under them at any moment.</p>
<p>It also suggests transparency: maybe everyone can be seen at any time. If you walk on a sheet of glass, you can be viewed from below. Which sounds not unlike the crosstime telepathic viewing that people in the castle are apparently doing of people in Earth’s past.</p>
<p>All of which leads me to the conclusion — which I didn’t actually expect when I started writing this — that my long-preferred interpretation is the correct one: that Quiss and Ajayi really are former warriors who have been banished to the castle as a punishment for misdeeds. The castle has the technology to let people live vicariously in the minds of humans from its past. At one point Quiss probably touches Grout’s mind and partly causes the road accident.</p>
<p>Is Grout really an exile from the same war, or a similar one? Probably not, but maybe. Maybe someone like Quiss or Aliya touched his mind at some earlier, vulnerable time, and something of their experience passed in to Grout.</p>
<p>But again, what of Graham’s story, and Sara’s betrayal? What does that have to do with the bigger stories?</p>
<p>I remain unsure.</p>

			 <html><body><p>As you’ll have noticed, I have mainly been reading books by Iain Banks lately. This is all part of something I’ve been thinking of as “The Great Banksie Reread,” which has been going on haphazardly for… <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2013/10/16/the-summer-of-rereading-2-a-culture-of-marvel-and-miracles/">five years, as I now see</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out that when I started rereading his works back in 2013, as well as doing so only very intermittently, I also didn’t keep records as I thought I had. The ones I know I read, but didn’t blog about, are <cite>The Bridge</cite>, <cite>The Crow Road</cite>, <cite>Excession</cite>, <cite>Look To Windward</cite>, and <cite>The State of the Art</cite> — or at least the title story.</p>
<p>As to why I didn’t blog about them, I guess I just didn’t write about my reading in some years. But it’s oddly lax of me. Blogging about them was kind of the point of the reread, surely — as well as my own enjoyment, of course.</p>
<p>Anyway, all these posts are now tagged with “<a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/tag/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a>“.</p>

			 <html><body><p>In <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://dancohen.org/2018/07/17/in-praise-of-email/">In Praise of Email</a> Dan Cohen writes of how email got things right, long before some of our other ways of interacting online came along and got so many things wrong.</p>
<p>I’ve long thought that email was the killer app of the internet, despite the problems that many people have with it. Those tend to be not inherent in email, but caused by the way we use it.</p>
<p>Here’s one point he makes, in regard to the algorithmic timelines that are ruining Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Although some email systems algorithmically sort email by priority or importance, that is not part of the email system itself. Again, this can be added, or not, by the user, and the default is strictly chronological.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Although my main problem, as I’ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/15/the-strange-case-of-the-lost-reply/">said before</a>, is with some clients that insisting that “chronological” means “newest first.”</p>

<blockquote><p>
  A REPL or read eval print loop is what we called an interactive prompt back in the day when I learnt Python and Ruby.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  For a REPL to make sense you need to be able to test small chunks of code. Like this function or this expression; or my typical thing, “would this work” or how the fuck was that syntax again?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve sometimes found that they have a downside. When you are looking for code examples, then if a language has a REPL, very often the examples show the use of a feature <em>in</em> the REPL. Which may be fine, but is not so helpful if you’re trying to find out how to construct a class or a function.</p>
<p>Which point, to be fair, Hjertnes does address:</p>
<blockquote>
  In other words, if your language require a lot of “foreplay” to run code, like declaring a namespace and a class etc (I’m looking at you Java and C#) it will probably not be the right thing. But if you can evaluate code without much fuss it is.
</blockquote>
<p>Java is supposed to be getting one soon, I believe, if it’s not already in version 9.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Back where it all began, then: Banksie’s debut.  It’s a bit dated, of course. Do you remember pay phones having pips? And  “I must convince dad to get a VTR.” Who ever called it a V<em>T</em>R, rather than V<em>C</em>R? Outside of TV companies, at least.</p>
<p>Still a great, crazy story with an ending that, now, seems less believable than it ever did. Well, the whole setup, really: the idea that you could have a child and not register them, and keep them away from all need for interaction with the authorities. Even if you lived on a private island, that’s hard to imagine nowadays.</p>
<p>And I had forgotten what a misogynistic character the narrator, Frank, is. Which is, frankly, ironic.</p>
<p>I recall reading a theory once that Eric, the crazy, dog-burning brother, doesn’t actually exist, that he was all a figment of Frank’s supercharged imagination. I was keeping that at the back of my mind as I read this time, and I don’t think there’s much evidence of it. But I’ll see if I can track down the actual theory.</p>
<p>Here we go: <a href="https://performativeutterance.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/the-weaponry-of-deceit/">“The Weaponry of Deceit: Speculations on Reality in <cite>The Wasp Factory</cite>” by Kev McVeigh</a>. Originally published in the BSFA’s <cite>Vector</cite> magazine.</p>
<p>Reading it again now, McVeigh has a point: Eric can be seen as a metaphor for Frank’s masculinity. But I prefer to take it at face value: sometimes a crazy family is just a crazy family.</p>
<p>The difficulty in searching for anything to do with this novel nowadays is that it’s on the English Literature curricula of both the English A-Levels and the Scottish Highers. So there are lots (and lots and lots) of sites offering analyses of it for students to <strike>plagiarise</strike> learn from. As well as all the Goodreads entries and blog posts you would expect.</p>
<p>And, <em>oops</em>! I’ve just added to the pile.</p>

			 <html><body><p>On Friday I went for a walk through central London with a couple of hundred thousand of my closest friends.</p>
<p>The march was due to start at 2pm from Portland Place. I was a little late. I went straight to Oxford Circus. I came out of the tube station and just stood and watched the people walking down Regent Street. It was amazing, and seemed endless. Then I saw these two with great signs:</p>
<p><a href="/images/2018/07/IMG_1911.jpg"><img src="/images/2018/07/IMG_1911.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Anti-Trump protestors with signs: 'If Adolph (sic) Hitler flew in today... They'd send a limousine anyway'; and 'Bloody Trump, combing over hair, taking our tax money.'"></img></a></p>
<p>A Clash quote and a bad pun? Count me in.</p>
<p>I walked down the pavement alongside the march for a bit, taking more photos.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2018/07/IMG_1915.jpg"><img src="/images/2018/07/IMG_1915.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Anti-Trump protestors, London, July 2018"></img></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/2018/07/IMG_1921.jpg"><img src="/images/2018/07/IMG_1921.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Anti-Trump protestors, London, July 2018"></img></a></p>
<p>Before long we got to Trafalgar Square.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2018/07/IMG_1927.jpg"><img src="/images/2018/07/IMG_1927.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Anti-Trump protestors in Trafalgar Square, London, July 2018"></img></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/2018/07/IMG_1949.jpg"><img src="/images/2018/07/IMG_1949.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Anti-Trump protestors in Trafalgar Square, London, July 2018"></img></a></p>
<p>There were many speakers and a few musicians. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_McCluskey">Len McCluskey</a> told us that the police had estimated the crowd was over 250,000, which was surprising, since they tend to underestimate. Anyway, if so, it was the biggest since the Iraq war demo. More amusingly, we were a bigger crowd than at Trump’s inauguration.</p>
<p>That said, I looked around and it didn’t feel that crowded. I’ve seen the O2 full, and I would guess that there were a similar 20,000 in the square.</p>
<p>But it turned out when I left that there were many, many people in the streets around the square. I guess they didn’t want to push forward because the square looked full. I’m quite glad about that.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was fantastic all day. The police presence was pleasingly low (or at least low-key), despite the stories of leave being cancelled and people drafted in from all over the country.</p>
<p>Did it do any good? Probably not, in the sense that it won’t have any direct effect on Trump. But it made a 
lot of people feel good, and it showed the world that we care.</p>

			 <p>Closer to the Cultural action again, though a lot of this happens on a shellworld, one of thousands of weird, ancient, constructed worlds scattered through the galaxy. They are an incredible image, but in a sense they don’t matter.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Most of the events that happen on the shellworld don’t <em>have</em> to be on it. Except maybe in this way: it allows Banks to tell a story that includes civilisations both at the musket stage, and at the godlike AI stage.</p>
<p>Civilisations on the various levels of shellworld are allowed to develop at their own pace, unhindered and unhelped by the more advanced “involved” groupings in the teeming galaxy (at least in theory). And yet they know of the existence of the advanced, spacefaring races. I can’t help but think that that very knowledge would have a profoundly debilitating effect on any society. Imagine knowing the Culture existed, but that you were excluded from it.</p>
<p>This is exactly why the Culture generally doesn’t make less advanced societies aware of its existence. It’s the reason for <cite>Star Trek</cite>’s Prime Directive. Yet somehow this story works even with some of its protagonists having that knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2008/02/25/matter-by-iain-m-banks-books-2008-1/">I wrote about it a decade ago</a>, when I first read it. I seem to have enjoyed it more this time. I didn’t notice the linguistic foibles, and while I was aware of the weird shadow-wrongness of the cover, I’m used to it, so it didn’t trouble me.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Ah, the Culture novel that some still think isn’t. I feel sorry for anyone who ever read this without knowing about the Culture first. The denouement must be <em>completely</em> mystifying.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2013/10/16/the-summer-of-rereading-2-a-culture-of-marvel-and-miracles/">Special Circumstances game</a> applies here, but of course we have absolutely no way of knowing what they’re up to. A Culture agent, alone on a backwards planet (technology at the level of muskets), acting as doctor to a king who’s maybe not quite as bad as some of the other rulers on the planet (or maybe, let’s face it, just as bad).</p>
<p>It’s unusual not to get even the slightest hint of the galaxy-spanning machinations that must be going on behind the scenes, but of course the narrator is a native of the planet and knows nothing about even the existence of other planets.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This is not a book about an imaginary rock musician: it’s a book about guilt.</p>
<p>Of course, it is about an imaginary rock musician too, but reading it now, for the third or perhaps fourth time, it’s striking to me how totally it’s about guilt. And not very subtly, either. It’s right there at the start of chapter 2:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Guilt. The big G, the Catholic faith’s greatest gift to humankind and its subspecies, psychiatrists . . . well, I guess that’s putting it a little too harshly; I’ve met a lot of Jews and they seem to have just as hard a time of it as we do, and they’ve been around longer
</p></blockquote>
<p>I had forgotten that the character of Daniel Weir (or “Weird”) was brought up as a Catholic. I don’t think any of Banksie’s other characters were. The man himself wasn’t. Not that it makes a lot of difference: his (and our) Scottishness has a lot more impact on his character — and his characters — than any religion his parents may have had.</p>
<p>As always, I had forgotten some key parts, but I remembered more of this than of most. It’s still great.</p>
<p>And I realise that these notes are becoming more about me, and what I remember, than about the books. But that’s fine. It’s my blog, after all, and as much as anything these <em>are</em> for me. They’re just out there in public in case anyone else is interested.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you haven’t read any Banks, then this would be a damn fine place to start. Though it’s interesting to note that — set as it is in the 70s and early 80s — it’s so dated that it feels almost like a period piece. One example: one of the members of the band buys an IBM mainframe and transfers recording-studio tapes to it, so he can play any track at the touch of a button. Something we can do from our pocket computers today.</p>
<p>But there was one point that I thought seemed anachronistic. Maybe not, but aluminium takeaway cartons? Chinese &amp; curries? In 1973? Hmmm. I mean, it is in the foaming metropolis of Paisley, not Balloch. And even we had a Chinese by 1980, 81, or so. Still, I wonder when those things started to become commonplace.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Back to the great reread. Some thoughts here. This book is 25 years old. Twenty-five! I think I’ve read it twice before, but (and you won’t be surprised here if you’ve been following along) I don’t remember much about it.</p>
<p>I didn’t recall, for example, that Sharrow, the protagonist, was a noble; or that it’s set as we approach the decamillenium on and around what I at first assumed to be an Earth colony, although one that is long detached from Earth. And it’s in a similar state to the last one I read, <cite>Feersum Endjinn</cite>, in that we’re in a decadent stage, where technology was more advanced in the past, but things have been lost or forgotten.</p>
<p>The most notable example of that, of course, is the Lazy Gun, the big maguffin at the heart of the story. I had thought it was semi-mystical, or at least alien in origin. But now I think maybe not, it’s just from the more advanced past.</p>
<p>Turns out it’s not anything to do with Earth, of course. Golter is a planet round an extra-galactic star. The million-light-year distance to any other star seems to be the “dark background” of the title. Though I still don’t really get why it’s called that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still loved it. And strangely the ending felt less bleak than I had remembered. Though it’s still pretty dark. And it turns out he <a href="http://www.rulit.me/books/against-a-dark-background-epilogue-read-290563-1.html">published an epilogue online</a>. Which doesn’t change anything, but it was nice to read.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Good piece by Paul Ford, writing at Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/github-is-microsoft-s-7-5-billion-undo-button">on Microsoft buying GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [GitHub] has a well-designed web interface. If you don’t think that’s worth $7.5 billion, you’ve never read the git manual.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He means the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">man pages</a>, I assume.</p>
<p>GitHub is “the central repository for decentralized (<em>sic</em>) code archives,” which is mildly amusing. But this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In the pre-git era, you updated your software annually and sent customers floppy disks. But if you’re running a big software platform, you might update your servers constantly—many times a day or every 20 minutes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>is a bit over the top. There were a lot of changes between sending out floppies and continuous deployment.</p>
<p>I question his (lack of) capitalisation. The command is <code>git</code>, all lower case. But if you’re talking about the application, you should spell it “Git”, with the capital. I think so, anyway. You would write about “CVS”, even though the command was (is) <code>cvs</code>; and “Subversion,” with the command <code>svn</code>. But at least it’s not as annoying as people who write it in all-caps.</p>
<p>Lastly, when he says, “Computers are mercurial,” I’m assuming he’s wryly referencing what was once <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org">Git’s major rival</a> in the distributed version-control space. Nicely deadpan, if so.</p>

Backlit and everything. No bad.</p>
<p>I do (mostly) like the keyboard itself, I think. Certainly I should be able to get used to it quite quickly. But I’m not loving the whole package: as I feared it might, it makes the iPad comparatively bulky.</p>
<p>I think I’ll keep it, though, and see how I get on. I may, for example, only take it out with me if I think I’ll definitely use it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that could get annoying: the best <em>X</em> is the one you have with you, after all. And it was using the Smart Keyboard (and having the long commute down to Croydon with (more or less) guaranteed seating) that helped me to <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/11/30/a-five-and-four-zeroes/">finish my novel last November</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, having a holder for the Apple Pencil is a nice addition.</p>

			 <p>Email apps, especially ones that offer advanced services like “send later,” may be storing our usernames and passwords on their servers.</p>
<p>To be clear what that means: if you use Gmail, for example, you put your Google username and password into the app when you set it up. You expect the app to store them securely on your device. But some apps may also be storing that username and password — your keys to all the Google services in this example — on computers owned by the company that makes the app. Computers over which neither you nor Google has any control.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting that the company I talk about below, or any other, is doing anything nefarious. They <em>need</em> to be able to log in to your mail server in order to send your mail later. But I hadn’t realised until now what that means, and I’m guessing neither will a lot of people.  And to my mind they don’t make what they’re doing clear enough.</p>
<p>Worst of all, having passwords stored on unknown servers — at the very least, that’s worrying.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>On <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/194">episode194</a> of the <cite>Connected</cite> podcast, <a href="https://www.relay.fm/people/mykehurley">Myke Hurley</a> and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/people/federicoviticci">Federico Viticci</a> were reviewing the latest version of the iOS (and Mac) app <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com">Spark</a>. It’s a fine email app, which I was using on my iPhone and iPad. So I was alarmed when they mentioned in passing that mail handled by the app is routed through <a href="https://readdle.com">Readdle’s</a> servers. That didn’t seem likely at first. Spark is an email <em>client</em>. You tell it what servers handle your mail, and it connects to them to receive and send. The servers belonging to the company that makes the app have no business getting involved in that.</p>
<p>I did some digging. Whether or not <a href="https://mykewasright.com">Myke was right</a>™ about mail going through their servers, the reality turned out to be much worse.</p>
<h2>Digging</h2>
<p>I tweeted at the Spark account. Here’s what happened:</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I had already found <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/privacy#privacy_2">their privacy policy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <strong>OAuth login or mail server credentials:</strong> Spark requires your credentials to log into your mail system in order to receive, search, compose and send email messages and other communication. Without such access, our Product won’t be able to provide you with the necessary communication experience. In order for you to take full advantage of additional App and Service features, such as “send later”, “sync between devices” and where allowed by Apple – “push notifications” we use Spark Services. Without using these services, none of the features mentioned above will function.
</blockquote>
<p>The wording “Spark requires your credentials to log into your mail system in order to receive, search, compose and send email messages” suggests that Spark the <em>app</em> needs to log into your server, which it does. But nothing about that says that your credentials will be stored on their servers.</p>
<p>Further down, in point 4, “How Long Personal Data is Stored For,” in a table that includes “Type of information,” we see (emphasis mine) :</p>
<blockquote>
  Email address, email content for Spark Services, <strong>mail server credentials</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>So there it is. They do store your username and password on their servers, and they do tell you; though only if you read well into the kind of document that notoriously goes unread.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>For features like “send later” they need to store the fact that you want to send an email at a specific time, and log in to your server in order to send it. And to be fair, I’m sure they can’t be alone in keeping that kind of data. Lots of clients offer “send later” and similar services, and all of them will have to log in to your mail server to work. So they have to store your credentials on <em>their</em> servers to do it.</p>
<p>And consider, if you use Gmail, that means your username and password not just for Gmail, but for <em>all</em> Google’s services, are now stored on somebody else’s servers. Their security might be great, but how do we know?</p>
<p>The more I think about this, the more concerned I become. Passwords should only be stored in one place: a secure, trusted password manager. But above all, these services need to be much clearer about the fact that they’re storing our passwords.</p>

			 <p>Gaiman takes on Thor, Loki, Odin, and the rest. Most of my knowledge of the Norse gods comes from Marvel Comics, with a bit of general cultural osmosis (for example, everyone has heard of <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/521/">Yggdrasil the World Tree</a>, right?)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I enjoyed it, but it feels like a slight work. That’s a shame, because these are mighty tales, or should be. I guess it’s a book meant at least partly for children, but it’s not marketed that way. And even if It’s meant for kids, the telling should be strong.</p>
<p>I suspect that if you already know the tales, this won’t offer much new to you. And that’s where the problem lies, I think. Instead of turning them into real narratives with proper characters, each story is not much more than a summary of the events. So he’s telling us the story of the story, rather than really telling (showing) the story. It’s a shame, because I know Gaiman could have done something much more interesting with these.</p>
<p>I’m probably being too harsh, though. It’s not like it’s <em>bad</em>. I enjoyed reading it.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Regarding Eurovision: I sort of understand why you can’t vote for your own country. Though if you could, would the most populous country automatically win? Or the country with the biggest LGBTQ community? I don’t think so. People would still vote for a song they liked. But it would be interesting to try it one year.</p>
<p>But more importantly: <em>why</em> can people in the UK not vote by text? Seems weirdly old-fashioned.</p>

			 <html><body><p>In <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/05/11/duplex-skepticism">A Little Duplex Skepticism</a>, John Gruber says what I’ve been thinking about the <a href="http://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Google Duplex</a> demo:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It’s totally credible that Google would be the first to achieve something like Duplex, but the fact that all they did — as far as I’ve seen — was play a recording just seems off. It feels like a con.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve only heard a bit of the “booking a haircut“ recording on a podcast. I thought it sounded a) impressive if real, but b) very possibly fake.</p>
<p>That kind of technology will come, eventually; but are we <em>that</em> close to it today?</p>
<p>(If we are, then whether or not we want it to be used in the kind of way demonstrated, is a whole other question.)</p>
<p>Google, of course, gave no timelines,  no suggestion of when such a feature might be available. Given that, it makes you wonder why they even bothered to demo it.</p>

			 <html><body><p>It’s six years old, but I finally got round to watching <cite>Looper</cite>. Interesting. Not sure about it. Some of the time-travel stuff didn’t make sense — or was confusing, at least. The loopers do their killing and body-disposal in the past, but by the time Bruce Willis comes into it, everyone involved is in the same time, 2044, the past of the movie.</p>
<p>Also I thought I had heard that it wasn’t well thought of, but <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/looper/">Rotten Tomatoes has it at 82% from audiences and 93% from critics</a>. That’s pretty good, isn’t it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.themarysue.com/looper-review/">This review at The Mary Sue</a> is  good on the weak points. Some interesting discussion in the comments, too.</p>
<p>The future was unconvincing — people still driving petrol-burning cars in 2044 and 2074? And the status of women was terrible. You can be a sex worker or a farming mom in future America. I mean, OK, we didn’t see the rest of society, but it’s not great. And a major Bechdel fail. Oh yes, and: the currency is silver? Actual, metallic silver? Time travel has really messed things up.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it on the whole, though, and the ending is great. We could have done without the voiceover, but maybe Rian Johnson, the director, has  plans to release a cut without it in one possible future. Now where have I come across that idea before?</p>

I was nominated by my friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006622569425">Peter</a> to join in with the long-form version.</p>
<p>I’m all about owning my own content, as you know, and not having it locked away in Facebook’s walled garden. So my plan is to write about ten albums, but to do so here, on my blog. Links to the posts will automatically be crossposted to Facebook anyway.</p>
<p>I started compiling a list of possibles, and thinking about starting to write posts. First I decided to restrict it one per artist. Otherwise I could just pick five by The Beatles and five by The Clash.</p>
<p>But then I played some albums, and thought some more.</p>
<p>See, I knew right up front that it was going to be almost entirely a white-guy fest. I wanted to approach it honestly, and not try to appear to be anything I’m not, so that’s how it would have to be. It would be reflecting my life as a music fan. As it stands the long list has one woman and no non-white people.</p>
<p>But as I played those albums — albums I love — and as I thought about them, I realised two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I know these albums too well. I’m not <em>bored</em> of them, but they can drift past without me really being aware of them, through overfamiliarity.</li>
<li>This won’t be very interesting, and certainly won’t have any surprises for anyone who knows me.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I’ve come to a decision, I think: I’m going to do it slightly differently. I’m going to write about ten albums that I like <em>now</em>. Ones that I’ve discovered in the last few years, maybe, or that I’ve known for a while but have listened to a lot more in recent years.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure what that list is going to look like. I only have two, maybe three definites on it at the moment, and it’s going to take a while to construct it. But I think it could be a much more interesting list — certainly for me — when it’s done.</p>
<p>And I’ll do a post with a rundown of what the original list <em>would</em> have been, just for completeness.</p>
<p>So watch out for those in the next few days.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This is a great story about how some people have to fix things in the aftermath of something they did that may change the world fundamentally, if not destroy it. With that description it sounds very similar to Ellis’s earlier webcomic (with Paul Duffield), <a href="http://www.freakangels.com">Freak Angels</a>.</p>
<p>Which is a fair enough assessment, though the triggering event in this case is a combination of AI, the internet, and old magic; as opposed to the psychic powers in the older work. Ellis has deeply embedded the “start late” advice often given to aspiring authors. Both of the works under discussion, and some of his others, start long after the events that set their plots in motion.</p>
<p>It can be a very effective device. We get to know characters who already know each other, and the past events are revealed gradually, through conversation and flashbacks. And the fact that the protagonists don’t at first fully understand what they did means that we learn along with them.</p>
<p>This is great, but the only frustrating thing is that these three volumes — comprising fifteen issues of the comic — are to date all that there is. I don’t know if they plan to continue it, but the last issue came out in November, and the story is far from over. Googling has not so far revealed the answer to this.</p>
<p>Recommended, though.</p>

			 <p>I read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/14/lovecraft-country-by-matt-ruff-review">this reviewed in <cite>The Guardian</cite></a>, and immediately bought the Kindle book. Sometimes a review is like that.</p>
<p>And it lived up to the praise. But here’s the thing: the horror, the weirdness in it: they’re not really what we’d think of as <em>Lovecraftian</em>.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with that, and part of the reason for the title is that a couple of the main characters are fans of Lovecraft’s work, and they refer to parts of New England as “Lovecraft country.” But as the review makes clear, the real horror here is much more down to Earth: the racism of 50s America.</p>
<p>My Kindle edition was slightly oddly titled: <cite>Lovecraft Country: TV Tie-In</cite>. You expect that on a physical book to some degree. But putting it right in the title is new to me. <a href="http://www.bymattruff.com/2017/05/17/lovecraft-country-will-be-a-series-on-hbo/">A page on the author’s site</a> confirms that it is going to be made as a series by HBO (which is annoying, because that means it’ll be on Sky Atlantic over here). JJ Abrams<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and Jordan Peele are both involved.</p>
<p>I’m slightly surprised to see that Ruff is not black. I wonder how long before he’ll be accused of “cultural appropriation” for writing from the viewpoint of African-Americans.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://devilgate.org/2018/04/08/tab-convert/">Tab Convert</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2018/04/08/tab-convert/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-04-09 00:21:39 &#43;0100">Apr 9, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>That’s <strong>con</strong>vert, with the stress on the first syllable. The noun, in other words. As in, “I am a tab convert.” A convert, that is, to using tabs for indentation of source code, instead of spaces.</p>
<h2>A Background of Spaces</h2>
<p>From the earliest time that I learned about the tabs vs spaces debate, I’ve been a spaces guy. This is at least partly because of the influence of my then-colleague <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/author/benjamin-geer">Benjamin Geer</a>. He has gone on to other, no doubt better, things, but he was probably the best programmer I’ve ever worked with. He introduced me to the idea that you should always use four spaces for indentation. The reason being that if you use tabs, people can have their editor’s tab size set to all sorts of different values, and it leads to source files not looking as you expect them to.</p>
<p>Whereas spaces are spaces: you can’t go wrong with a space (or four).</p>
<p>I’ve changed, though. I have become a convert, in my job, and maybe philosophically, to tabs.</p>
<h2>Stack Overflow Survey</h2>
<p>About a year ago there was a <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017">survey of developers on Stack Overflow</a>. Among many questions, they asked about whether people used spaces or tabs. The <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/">detail that got most attention</a> was that developers who use spaces were paid more on average than those who use tabs. I strongly suspect that correlation is not causation in this case, but it seemed noteworthy at the time.</p>
<p>More interesting to me was the fact that <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#work-tabs-or-spaces">more people used tabs</a>, at 42.9% against 37.8%. I was surprised: I thought spaces had won years ago. Though I often wondered (<a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/04/28/3353/">sometimes publicly</a>, and I’m surprised to see that was only last year) why the default setting for Eclipse was tabs.</p>
<p>Maybe that default, and others like it, is part of the reason for the statistics. Most people don’t change defaults. On the other hand, surely developers are the kind of people who are <em>most likely</em> to change defaults?</p>
<p>Anyway, after the survey came out there were various posts about it, notably <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/15/spaces-vs-tabs">John Gruber</a>, who said he was “a devout user of tabs”. OK, he’s not a developer these days, but there were others who are who said similar things. The one that struck me was one that I can’t locate now that said “tabs are semantic.” In other words, pressing the tab key means “indent here.” Four spaces means… four spaces? Could be an indentation, could be something else.</p>
<h2>Everything Changes Imperially</h2>
<p>So I was primed for the idea of switching to tabs, even though I still used spaces in <a href="http://tinlion.software/products/pertwee/">my own projects</a>. And then I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/03/03/imperial-adventures/">started my new job at Imperial College</a>. When I first started looking at <a href="https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility">the code</a>, I quickly realised that it was indented with tabs throughout. I checked with my co-worker who is the main contributor. He didn’t mind, but they had always used tabs.</p>
<p>Obviously I didn’t want to introduce a mixture. That’s what <em>really</em> messes up the display of code in different editors. You have to be consistent within a project. So if I were to change the project to spaces I would have to change every file. That was an unnecessary step; and per the above, I was primed to use tabs. They’re semantic, after all.</p>
<p>I switched my IDE to indent using tabs, with the tab-stop value set to 4. And so we proceed, tabbing away merrily.</p>
<p>So far I prefer it this way.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This book could have been written for me. Seriously, during the first part it felt like it was targeted right at me.</p>
<p>I am, as you probably know, a <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2015/01/05/the-illuminatus-trilogy-by-robert-shea-and-robert-anton-wilson-books-2014-17/">fan and repeat reader of <cite>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</cite></a>. As clearly are Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, or the KLF, as they used to be known. This book is — what, a spoof of, a homage to? — <cite>Illuminatus</cite>. Explicitly modelled on it, referring back to it constantly.</p>
<p>Plus there are lots of Beatles references, and I’ve been into them for even longer. Then among the characters are Alan Moore, who (in this corner of the multiverse) is a member — along with Cauty and Drummond — of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Noise_Terror">Extreme Noise Terror</a>. Our world’s version of that band did collaborate with the KLF, but as far as I can tell they had no connection with Moore.</p>
<p>So don’t expect to get too much accurate information about popular culture out of this. Plenty of references, though. Other characters include Michelle O’Bama, M’Lady Gaga, Yoko Ono (two versions), Lady Penelope, and her chauffeur/hitman Aloysius Parker.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of fun. The downside is that it’s not very well written, at least as far as the dialogue is concerned. Most notable is the complete absence of contractions. Which is fine for an odd thing, or maybe to give one character a particular voice, but when no-one uses them, it all gets a little strange.</p>
<p>The story is fun, though, and I finished it and immediately started rereading <cite>Illuminatus</cite> yet again, so there’s that.</p>

			 <html><body><p>What with the strike on, I wasn’t too keen on the idea of crossing a picket line, but there wasn’t really one. Nobody in the group I’m in was striking, as far as I could tell, and I’m not in the union (yet). And you know, the contract had a start date of last Monday. So one week into my <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/03/03/imperial-adventures/">new job</a>, and I’m enjoying it tremendously.</p>
<p>I’ve been bashing bugs in a large and complex codebase. It was very satisfying to take the failing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">tests</a> from 600 down to 490 with a single commit. That’s 600 failing tests out of 800. And looking at what’s there, it’s hard to see how some of them could ever have passed. I sort of get the impression that a whole lot might have been written but never run.</p>
<p>That big win involved nothing more than changing a class from being <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html">all static methods</a> to being one that you can instantiate, and then passing in a test version of a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html"><code>ResourceBundle</code></a>, instead of trying to read a properties file which wasn’t there in my setup.</p>
<p>More importantly, the people are nice. The commute is shorter than to Croydon, by a good half hour. But it’s a lot more crowded on the Circle Line than I remember from two years ago when I was at Misys.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Just over a month ago I posted a <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/02/01/4158/">brief note</a> about job news, saying that more details would be forthcoming. I was, as I said then, just waiting for some paperwork.</p>
<p>It took longer than I expected to get that paperwork sorted out, but I received and returned the contract yesterday afternoon. On Monday I start work at the <a href="http://www.sahsu.org">Small Area Health Statistics Unit</a> (SAHSU), part of the School of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College.</p>
<p>That’s quite a mouthful, but in short I’ll be working on programming something called the <a href="https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility">The Rapid Inquiry Facility</a> (RIF), which is an open-source tool for studying health statistics.</p>
<p>I’m neither a medical researcher nor a statistician, but I am a programmer (or a software engineer, if you want to be fancy). Our job is to understand the needs of someone — usually referred to as “the business,” but I’m guessing that will be different in my new job — and translate those needs into actions in software. That basic definition doesn’t change according to the problem domain. Whether it’s sending payments from one bank to another, checking a person’s right to work on a government database, or doing something with statistical data about health issues, the programmer’s job is to understand what the user needs and make things happen on a screen.</p>
<p>The big difference for me, I think, will be that in this new role I’ll have the chance to contribute to doing something good in the world. As I said at my interview, I’ve mainly worked in financial software, and while, sure, people need banks, it wasn’t the most socially-usefully thing. The last half-year working at the Home Office had some value, but I was a tiny cog in a huge machine.</p>
<p>At Imperial I’ll be able to feel that I’m actually contributing something useful to society, as well as doing what should be really interesting work.</p>
<p>Oh, and: I’ll be back in Paddington, which I know from my Misys days, and it’s a much shorter commute than to Croydon.</p>

			 <p>I watched the new series of <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> in January, but haven’t got round to writing about it yet. In part, maybe, because I knew I wanted to read this. In part, because I want to watch it all again.</p>
<p>The series was amazing: an incredible, beautiful, challenging piece of art. But, as always with <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> there was the question at the back of my mind: is he using surrealism to raise real questions, to investigate mysteries, to raise our consciousness? Or is it just weirdness for weirdness’s sake?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In the end I lean towards the former. Maybe the whole thing is like a zen koan: if a portal opens in Ghostwood Forest and no-one is there to see it, what will come through?</p>
<p>Anyway, addressing the book at hand, what we have is quite a short volume which is presented as being a report from FBI Special Agent Tamara Preston to Deputy Director Gordon Cole (played by Lynch himself in the show, of course). Its ostensible purpose is for her to summarise what she and the Bureau have learned from the events that the recent series covered, and some other offscreen investigations. It follows on from, and comments on, <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/03/the-secret-of-twin-peaks-by-mark-frost-books-2017-1/">last year’s <cite>Secret History of Twin Peaks</cite></a>.</p>
<p>Much of it repeats what was in the series, but it does add detail and help to clarify some things. For example it’s probably not a spoiler to confirm that the girl in the 1950s in the glorious nightmare of episode 8 was, indeed, Sarah Palmer, as Warren Ellis has speculated. (It was in <a href="http://orbitaloperations.com/">his newsletter</a>, which doesn’t seem to have a public archive.)</p>
<p>But it also follows up on what happened to most of the characters from the the original series that we didn’t hear about in the new one, giving us much-needed closure. Or at least convincing us that the creators didn’t totally forget about Donna, for example. Along the way it does what the new series failed to do, in that it answers the question raised at the end of the original series: “How’s Annie?”</p>
<p>It’s worth reading, but it doesn’t remove the need for me to watch the whole new series again.</p>

			 <html><body><p>The Great Banks Reread picks up again. I was prompted to read this, despite the pile of Christmas books next to my bed, because of Facebook.</p>
<p>I must have Liked the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction on there at some point, because a post popped up linking to the <a href="http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/parks_and_recreation">entry for <cite>Parks and Recreation</cite></a>. Whose very existence is surprising (the entry, that is), but it’s just because the last season or so takes place in the near future.</p>
<p>Anyway, the article refers to something called a ‘<a href="http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/slingshot_ending">slingshot ending</a>.’ This is not a term I had heard before, so I tapped through. To be honest even reading it again now, I don’t really understand what they mean by it.</p>
<p>But the article includes the assertion that <cite>Feersum Endjinn</cite> has such an ending. I’ve just finished rereading it, and inasmuch as I do understand what a slingshot ending is, I don’t agree that this is one such.</p>
<p>Which doesn’t matter at all. I still loved it. And as with many of these rereads, I was surprised by how many details I didn’t remember. Most notably I had totally forgotten that it is set at a time in the far future when Earth’s survival is threatened by an astronomical phenomenon (a dust cloud that will eventually occlude the sun).</p>
<p>The ending… well, that would be to spoil things. Just read it if you haven’t already.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>You know how they say you shouldn’t meet your heroes? Well it turns out that sometimes that includes not meeting them between the pages of a book. I’m not sure I’d  call Warren Zevon a hero, but he’s definitely a hugely respected and much missed singer and songwriter.</p>
<p>I knew of the tales of wild and crazy behaviour, though I hadn’t actually read any of them — except inasmuch as they come out in the songs. And anyway, those tales are a dime a dozen in rock’n'roll. A lot of this biography, though, is concerned with the people he hurt.</p>
<p>Which is fine, not least since the author — his wife and the mother of one of his children — is a major one of those people. Most of his bad behaviour happened while he was an alcoholic — or while he was drinking, I suppose I should say, since the standard twelve-step narrative is that you never stop being one. Alcoholics Anonymous helped him to stop, though he eventually stopped going to meetings. He didn’t drink for seventeen years, and the opening chapter tells us that when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer he had a scotch. Who could blame him for stepping off he wagon at a time like that?</p>
<p>So he comes across as a far from pleasant character. But my disappointment with the book is more about the complete focus on the man and his relationships, almost to the exclusion of the music.</p>
<p>“The man and his relationships” sounds like an important set of themes to address in a biography. But in the case of a creative person — or really any person worthy of a biography — a key part of the story of their life is their <em>works</em>. If it’s a writer you’ll expect to read about their books; a politician, their victories and defeats; a general their battles. And of course, a musician, their music. It would be strange to read a biography of Beethoven or the Beatles that told of their personal lives but largely elided the music.</p>
<p>Which may be the key: this isn’t a <em>biography</em>, as such. It makes no attempt to be comprehensive, and there’s no real narrative. Although there are plenty of reminiscences from Crystal, the vast bulk of the book is reminiscences from people in Zevon’s life, directly quoted and preceded with their names; almost like a play script. Presumably Crystal interviewed them all, but she herself comes across as just one of the interviewees.</p>
<p>There are quotes from Zevon’s diaries, but he either wrote them in a very fragmented, abbreviated way, or they have been heavily edited. An example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Jan. 12, 1975<br>
    … Took Jordan, visited Father at the steam baths. He gave me a handsome Seiko watch and $135 … quarreling with Crystal … T-Bone came over for spaghetti and I quaffed vodka martinis all night. T-Bone trounced me soundly at chess which surprised and aggravated me, but pleased me, too, by mellowing my lonely-giant-of-the-intellect trip … Made love.<br>
  <br>
  Jan. 15, 1975<br>
    … Snorted coke which kept Crystal awake all night … she’s thinking of pregnancy and worried about chemicals in her body …
</p></blockquote>
<p>(All ellipses in original.)</p>
<p>After he gets sober the diary entries become more frequent, which is good. But as a fan of his music, I would have liked to read a lot more about it: its creation, how it was accepted or not at the time, stories of gigs and recording studios, and all that. Unfortunately Crystal wasn’t really involved in that part of his life, and the interviewees who were — like Jorge Calderón or Jackson Brown — either weren’t asked to talk about it, or weren’t quoted doing so.</p>
<p>So not quite the music biography I’d have liked, but not without interest.</p>

			 <html><body><p>It was drawn to my attention a couple of weeks ago that I have not yet expressed (publicly) an opinion on either <cite>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</cite> or the <cite>Doctor Who</cite> Christmas special. That is both true, and very remiss of me. Trouble is it’s now been quite a while since I saw them both.</p>
<p>Still, I should be able to gather together a few memory cells.</p>
<h2><cite>The Last Jedi</cite></h2>
<p>I went on opening night, as <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/12/14/4017/">I microblogged</a>. It was great. There are some points that could have been done differently, or left out, or speeded up; and it had the weird effect towards the end of there being a series of times when I thought it was finished, and it still wasn’t. But all in all a fine work. Not as good as <cite>The Force Awakens</cite>, maybe. But that’s partly because that one raised our expectations so high.</p>
<h2>‘Twice Upon A Time’</h2>
<p>Peter Capaldi’s last episode. It was damn fine, loads of fun. Great to see Bill back, even if not exactly. Unnecessary Daleks, but quite a good use of them — or ‘it,’ I should say.</p>
<p>And the introduction of ‘Testimony,’ scooping up people’s memories and saving them, is great. Though how many computer-simulated afterlives can one series have?</p>
<p>And what a dramatic start Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor is going to have.</p>
<p>There you go, only a month or so after the events.</p>

			 <html><body><p>The worst thing about this book is that it tells you, two or three chapters from the end, that it’s only the first half of the story. Now, I knew there are two other books in the series, but I expected the first book to be at least capable of standing alone. Turns out it isn’t: the ending leaves us hanging right after the big reveal.</p>
<p>The other worst thing about this book is that I’m not really that compelled to read on. I mean, I probably will, but it’s not like when I read <cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion">Hyperion</a></cite>, say, and had to scurry around the city trying to find a copy of the second volume.<sup id="fnref-6028-Hyperion"><a href="#fn-6028-Hyperion" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>After all the fuss <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/26/publishers-and-sinners/">about it not being published in the UK, and me not being able to get it</a>, I had high expectations. Probably too high, as it turns out.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: it’s by no means a bad book, and it’s astonishingly accomplished for a first novel. I did enjoy reading it. Its true weakest point— ignore all that complaining above — is that it can be a little bit hard to understand the world she creates. Not impossible, though, and Palmer does go to some efforts to explain it with minimal infodumping. Or at least with infodumping disguised as a conversation with the reader, which works quite well.</p>
<p>It’s about four hundred years in the future, and since the Church War some two hundred or so earlier, the world no longer exists as countries in the way that we know them. Instead people are members of one of seven “hives,” which they can choose to align themselves with at majority. Or not: some people are hiveless by choice.</p>
<p>Countries mean less at least in part because of super-fast international transport by “cars,” which I think are probably suborbital rockets or similar. Though they may have a more advanced propulsion system. The most confusing thing is probably that the leaders of the seven hives are characters and each of them has several names. For any given one of them, each of the others might know them by a different nickname, and the narrator uses these interchangeably. It gets hard to keep track of who’s who.</p>
<p>Global warming appears to have been conquered, or ameliorated to the point where it’s not a major concern. In fact it seems to be very close to a post-scarcity society. People only work at things they want to, and seem to be able to live OK without having to work.</p>
<p>Apart from “Servicers,” that is. Our narrator, Mycroft Canner, is one of these. People convicted of sufficiently serious crimes can end up as one of these. They are essentially public slaves. They are required to work for seemingly anyone who asks them, and are paid in food and board — and occasionally other treats such as cinema tickets. But they have no other way to get these things.</p>
<p>I found it quite a disturbing an idea; though it would almost certainly be better than being in prison; and at least they don’t have the death penalty.</p>
<p>That’s not the most disturbing thing in the book. But I’ll say no more about that.</p>
<p>As I write about it, my estimation of it is going up. Isn’t that strange? If I write enough about it I’ll probably stop to download <cite>Seven Surrenders</cite>, the next volume.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, as I said, it says it’s “the first half” of Canner’s story; but there are two more volumes. Are they both short, or is the third one more standalone? There’s only one way to find out.</p>
<p>But I have a stack of other things to read first. Also I realise I have no idea what the title has to do with the story. 📖</p>

<p>Amanda Petrusich, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/lana-del-rey-radiohead-and-the-difficulty-of-making-original-music">writing in <cite>The New Yorker</cite></a>, tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Eventually, Warner/Chappell*, Radiohead’s publisher at the time of the song’s release, refuted her claim: “It’s clear that the verses of ‘Get Free’ use musical elements found in the verses of ‘Creep’ and we’ve requested that this be acknowledged in favor of all writers of ‘Creep,’ ” the company said in a statement. “To set the record straight, no lawsuit has been issued and Radiohead have not said they ‘will only accept 100%’ of the publishing of ‘Get Free.’ ”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Which seems fairly clear. Read the whole article, though. It’s interesting.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Pop star Lana Del Rey says she’s being sued by Radiohead for copying their breakthrough single, ‘Creep.’
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not a fan of Lana Del Rey, but I just listened to her song, ‘Get Free,’ and the only similarity is the chord progression in the first verse. You can’t claim copyright in a chord progression. Or if you can, you shouldn’t be able to.</p>
<p>If the chords <em>and the melody</em> were the same, they’d have a point, but even then apparently they want 100% of the publishing royalties; don’t the words count? Del Rey has offered them 40%, and I think that’s way too much.</p>
<p>I’m amused that the album containing the song gets its title from a doubtless much better one by the same name: <cite><a href="https://www.allmusic.com/album/lust-for-life-mw0000654897">Lust for Life</a></cite>. There’s no copyright in titles, of course.</p>

<p>A strong start, tapering off in the middle, with a rally in November and then a complete collapse in December. I suspect the last is from a combination of <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/11/30/a-five-and-four-zeroes/">post-nano slump</a> and the festive season.</p>

			 <p>The news that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/13/rupert-murdoch-set-to-sell-off-21st-century-fox-assets-to-disney">Murdoch plans to sell 21st Century Fox and Sky TV to Disney</a> is interesting for how it will reshape the media landscape. But it’s good from my point of view for a number of reasons, some relatively trivial and to do with content consumption; and one big.</p>
<ol>
<li>The X-Men and the Fantastic Four will come under the control of Marvel Studios. Just in time for <cite>Infinity War</cite>. Well, of course, far too late — even, I would imagine, for <cite>Infinity War Part 2</cite>. I expect that’s at least planned by now.</li>
<li>Even more trivial, Lucasfilm can put the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/30/disney-lucasfilm">Fox fanfare</a> back at the start of future <cite>Star Wars</cite> movies (and add them in to future reissues of the recent ones).</li>
<li>It will become ethical to watch Sky TV. More of which below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Above all: better Disney than Murdoch.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Will Disney own too much? Hell yes. But see above.</p>
<p>On the ethics of watching — and paying for — Sky TV: see this blog <em>passim</em> for my thoughts on that. Like <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/30/things-we-cant-see/">here</a> and <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/07/12/boycott-news-international-for-life-i-already-did/">here</a>. If Sky had not been owned by Murdoch we might conceivably have got it in the past. But I feel we’re highly unlikely to get it now. Buying a dish in 2017 would just be weird, and our side of the road is not cabled, by some odd historical aberration. But there’s the online version,  which I think is called Direct TV. If we had had that I would have been able to watch the new <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> when it was actually broadcast, instead of now, on DVD, as is actually happening.</p>
<p>Loving it, by the way. And managed to hear no spoilers whatsoever, surprisingly.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I bought an Amazon Fire TV Stick in the Black/Cyber/Whatever sales, because I thought it would be a good way to watch BBC iPlayer, Netflix, and so on, on the telly, without having to plug a laptop in, as we do at present. Tonight I tried to set it up.</p>
<p>Amazon have decided to use replaceable batteries like it’s the 90s, instead of using a rechargeable like it’s today. I found it <em>literally</em> impossible to open the back of the remote.</p>
<p>The very fact that there are multiple YouTube videos explaining how to open the thing should be a giveaway. Unfortunately they all say, “It’s easy enough now because I’ve opened it before; it was really hard at first.”</p>
<p>The Apple TV may be several times the price, and the remote has its critics. But you just know you’re not going to have bollocks like this when you try to start using it.</p>
<p>Right now I’m planning to send the Fire TV Stick back. I’ll have another go when more of the family are around, and maybe we’ll get it. But I can’t help but wonder, what about someone who’s a bit older and maybe has arthritic hands? This is <em>incredibly</em> bad product design.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I have finished my novel. Hooray!</p>
<p>Stats: 121,304 words. 44,107 of them since the 1st of November.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a great deal still to do before it will be ready for anyone else to see, but I’m going to put it away for a couple of months before starting rewrites.</p>
<p>There is one little downside: that 44,000 word figure, while by far the most I’ve ever written in a November (or any other month) does not quite reach the 50,000 required to “win” NaNoWriMo. Which doesn’t really matter, as the whole purpose of the thing is to encourage us to get the words down, get a first draft out onto the solid-state drive.</p>
<p>But I’ve come this far. It would be nice to hit the 50,000 mark. Luckily there is a solution.</p>
<p>The publisher Angry Robot has an <a href="https://www.angryrobotbooks.com/open-door-2017-guides-faq/">open submissions period</a> running until the end of December. That means they accept and will read manuscripts from writers, instead of requiring all submissions to be via agents as normal.</p>
<p>Now obviously I’m not thinking about the just-completed first draft for this. But the one I finished before is ready. Except for two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>I submitted it the last time Angry Robot had one of these.</li>
<li>I’ve never been happy with the beginning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point 1 would bar me from resubmitting, except it wasn’t rejected the last time. I just never heard back from them. So I asked on their comments page, and they said I could assume it got lost, which allows me to resubmit.</p>
<p>Point 2 gives me the ideal thing to work on for the rest of the month: rewrite the beginning of the previous novel.</p>
<p>So it’s time to jump back into the world of <cite>The Accidental Upgrade</cite> (though I may try to think of a new title).</p>

			 <p>Yes, it’s halfway through the second-last month of the year and I’ve just finished my fifth book. Five in a year. That’s very poor. But this book was a large part of the reason for that.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>At over 1000 pages of very small text — close to a million words, I’ve heard — this is a  mammoth work. It’s also really, really good.</p>
<p>As befits such a large work, it is a whole made of many parts. It’s split into three main sections, with each of those having eleven chapters; along with a “Prelude” and an “Afterlude.” The first is a series of short stories or vignettes, most of which are not obviously connected. They are all set in and around an area of Northampton called the Boroughs, at various times in the past and present.</p>
<p>In the second we find out what happened to Mick Warren, the closest thing we have to a protagonist, after he died aged three, before he came back to life again. The third brings it all together, after a fashion. Moore has always had trouble with endings — just consider the mighty <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></cite>, whose ending was actually improved by the movie.</p>
<p>Did Alma Warren’s pictures save everything, and stop the destructor? Of course not: it always happened that way and always will. That’s the central thesis of the novel, the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternalism_(philosophy_of_time)">eternalism</a>, that time is static, and we only experience change because we happen to be moving along that axis at one second per second. This is of course similar to the viewpoint of Dr Manhattan in the aforementioned <cite>Watchmen</cite>, so we could suppose it’s a worldview that Moore has had for some time, though in his acknowledgements he suggests that he came to believe it during the years he was writing <cite>Jerusalem</cite>.</p>
<p>There is a chapter in book three that is written in the style of Joyce in his <cite>Finnegan’s wake</cite> days. It’s hard work to get through, but well worth it (though with hindsight if you were to skip that chapter I don’t think you’d miss much of the plot). Anyway, it’s a monster work, and well worth the time it takes to read.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I appreciate <a href="http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/2017/11/20/macolm-young/">this piece about AC/DC and Malcolm Young’s legacy</a>. I never really cared for them myself. I was on the other side of the punk/metal wars, of course, and screechy vocals always put me off.</p>
<p>I completely understand the spirit of that piece, though, and feel the same way about The Clash, the Velvet Underground, probably others. But there is one telling line in it that says something about the different attitudes of the different sides in those not-really wars. I don’t know, maybe not; but this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  But we thought we were gonna live forever. The music too.
</p></blockquote>
<p>is not how things were for me, for us. We didn’t think we’d live beyond the eighties. The nineties at a pinch As Queen put it, we were the ones who:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  grew up tall and proud<br>
  Under the shadow of the mushroom cloud.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But so too did the author of the AC/DC piece. He’s a decade older than me, but that still means he experienced the cold war.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s not generation, but location. I lived a few miles from the Faslane naval base, where the Polaris submarines were based (and where the Trident ones are still). We knew we’d be one of the first places to go.</p>
<p>Generations are too abstract, too arbitrary to make sweeping statements about in any case. But I still sometimes find myself surprised to be here, now, in this century.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> is just around the corner, and I still haven’t quite decided whether to throw myself into it this year or not. I’ve taken part several times in previous years, but never completed the 50,000 words. And this year I still have the novel that I’ve been working on intermittently for about four years, that I’d like to finish off.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be better, and more in the Nano spirit, to start something new. But I think if I were to do that, I’d never finish this one, and it would sit there forever, haunting me. Maybe taunting me too, who knows.</p>
<p>I should have a better chance of getting the word count up this year, as I have a longer commute, and I usually get a seat at or near the start of the longest part (Dalston Junction to West Croydon, if you’re interested). So it should be entirely possible to get two free blocks of writing time each weekday. But I have found it to be strangely offputting to write in that environment, when there’s a person sitting on either side of me.</p>
<p>Sure, they’re probably not in the least interested in what I’ve got going on, but as Stephen King says in <cite>On Writing</cite>, you’ve got to write the first draft with the door closed.</p>
<p>Still, I have recently been looking at the novel again, and I think I’ve worked out how to end it. That has always been the problem for me: I don’t do a detailed plot, but I need to know how a story’s going to end if I’m going to have any chance of finishing it. If I just start writing with only an idea, maybe a setting and some characters, I tend to meander around all over the place and never get anywhere. Or at least, not to a sensible end.</p>
<p>I don’t have to know much about the route, but I need to know the destination, in other words. So as I now know the destination — or at least have a much clearer idea of it — I think it’s time to take one last run at this thing.</p>
<p>But this is me declaring that I’m throwing my hat in the Wrimo ring. I’ve <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/participants/devilgate/novels/this-insubstantial-pageant">signed up</a>, and even given it a working title<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> — by raiding that fount of quotes, <cite>The Tempest</cite>.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Spoilers ahead, obviously. Although I don’t go into much detail.</p>
<p>We saw it in the <a href="http://riocinema.org.uk/">Rio</a> in Dalston, because all the Hackney Picturehouse showings were full (or at least just had a couple of separated seats left). Which makes me surprised to read these stories about it not doing very well on opening weekend. And weirdly, from the <em>balcony</em>. I don’t know when I was last in a cinema with a balcony. I mean, the Rio, obviously, though probably not since <cite>Harry Potter 8</cite>; but I hadn’t been in the balcony before, and I don’t think I even realised that it had one.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22310528_695400790653923_2498351281467612320_n.jpg"></p>
<p>But to the film of the moment. I tried to lower my expectations, I really did. But I’d read that <cite>Guardian</cite> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/blade-runner-2049-review-ryan-gosling-harrison-ford-denis-villeneuve">review</a>, which was so unbelievably glowing. I listened to Mitch Benn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_T9DqwB3e0">hoping they wouldn’t fuck it up</a> and believed that they hadn’t.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_T9DqwB3e0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>OK, they <em>haven’t</em> fucked it up. But I’m going to have to break ranks with all the legions of newspaper reviewers who love it to death &amp; back (honestly, I can hardly find a bad, or even a mixed, review), and nearly everyone else.</p>
<p>Because I didn’t enjoy it all that much. I spent a lot of the time (of which there is a <em>lot</em>) saying, “What the fuck is going on here? Why did they do that?” The former is fine, as long as it becomes clear over time, which it generally did. The latter less so: understanding characters’ motivations is fundamental to understanding and enjoying a work of fiction.</p>
<p>But much worse than those: I spent some of the time bored.</p>
<p>The main reason for that is that it’s paced like an 80s movie. Which is to say, much more slowly than we are used to today.</p>
<p>I should have expected that, I suppose. The original <cite>Blade Runner</cite> moves slowly even by 80s standards. That’s part of its visual and storytelling style. So it’s reasonable that a sequel, even one thirty years later, should follow suit. But they could have picked the pace up <em>a bit</em>.</p>
<p>The reviews all describe it as “thought-provoking” or similar, and it’s true that the questions of what it means to be human or to be artificial are in there. But to my mind there’s not enough of that. Which in a way is linked to another problem: world-building.</p>
<p><aside>
    <blockquote class="pull-right">
        <p>It’s paced like an 80s movie</p>
    </blockquote>
</aside></p>
<p>As before the world is very visually striking. What we have is the world of <cite>Blade Runner</cite> with thirty years of technological advancements. Like the film, the pace of advancement has been slow, but I suppose that’s not surprising, given how damaged the world is.</p>
<p>But slowly or quickly, technology advances in parallel with a conversation <em>about</em> that technology. What’s missing here is any in-world debate about the legal and ethical status of replicants. Certainly there’s a nod to the idea that the casual use of “skin-job” is insulting and shouldn’t be used. But it never seemed that insulting anyway — indeed I think it’s only the voiceover version of the original that tells us it <em>is</em> an insult. Deckard likens it to the n-word. (He does so <em>using</em> that word, which, rightly, would not happen today.)</p>
<p>In a more realistic world there would be a debate about replicants. There would be rights groups campaigning against using them as slaves, and even for them to be given full citizenship status. And from others there would be discrimination against them, abuse of them. That could all be going on in the background of this society — and the debate is not what the film is <em>about</em> — but I think a small acknowledgement that the debate existed would at least hint at a richer society.</p>
<p><aside>
    <blockquote class="pull-left">
        <p>Technology advances in parallel with a conversation <em>about</em> that <br />technology.</p>
    </blockquote>
</aside></p>
<p>That all applies to the original too, of  course, but now it’s much more common for the replicants to be living among humans on Earth, so the conversation would be that much more active.</p>
<p>And speaking of that commonality of the replicants on Earth, one question you might ask is, are there any humans actually left on Earth? Because only two characters appear to be unambiguously human.</p>
<p>One is K’s boss in the LAPD, Lt Joshi, who could unknowingly be a replicant, though nothing suggests that. The other, Ana Stelline, who creates the memories that are implanted in replicants. She lives in isolation because of sensitivity to the environment, and the implication is that only a human can provide the memories. But since not all of the memories are actually hers, all that needs is gift for imaginative imagery. And, now that we know that replicants are fully-biological beings who can reproduce (whether only with each other or also with humans is unknown), then anything is possible.</p>
<p>The situation appears to be that anyone with the money and without any disqualifying problem has left Earth. “A new life awaits you in the offworld colonies,” after all. I always suspected that the colonies would consist of grinding hardship based on subsistence farming, but I suppose the idea is you have replicant slaves to do the work.</p>
<p>
<aside>
    <blockquote class="pull-right">
        <p>There are no robots in these <br /> films.</p>
    </blockquote>
</aside>
</p>
<p>The Earth that we see is incredibly empty. The original’s LA streets were packed with people, but now it seems sparsely populated at best. Empty highways — because of course nobody’s driving cars anymore. But the air is empty too. Mostly there’s only ever one car flying at a time. All those giant buildings might be filled with people, but you don’t get any sense of them being there.</p>
<p>San Diego is a literal dump, and Las Vegas a nuclear wasteland. Apart from the still-standing casino hotel, of course. A million bottles of whisky and you choose Johnnie Walker Black Label? Come <em>on</em>. (That brand is owned by Diageo, though, which is the first of the big neon advertising signs you see.)</p>
<p>I don’t know, I wonder if it was just my expectation of something more striking, more startling. Don’t get me wrong: I didn’t hate it, or even dislike it. I was just disappointed by it. Yet I think I want to see it again.</p>
<p>I loved the music, by the way, though it was perhaps a bit overwhelming in places.</p>
<p>
<aside>
    <blockquote class="pull-left">
        <p>I think I want to see it again.</p>
    </blockquote>
</aside>
</p>
<p>And as a last thought: I still see people talking about the replicants being ‘robots’ or ‘androids.’ If it wasn’t clear from the first film, where they bled what seemed to be blood, it is powerfully obvious now: there are no robots in these films. The replicants are fully biological. They are probably more like clones, genetically engineered for enhanced strength and stamina.</p>
<p>The original book had androids (the clue was in the title); but not these films.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I think I might have to develop an app for reading Facebook the way I think it should work.</p>
<p>There was an article doing the rounds the other week about how “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia">our minds can be hijacked</a>,” which was all about how terrible social networking is for us. I skimmed part of it, but got annoyed when it seemed to be about rich Silicon Valley entrepreneurs deciding to go “off-grid.” That’s all very well for them, but most of us have to make a living.</p>
<p>More pertinently, since the main target for the attack was Facebook, it annoyed me because I use Facebook to keep in touch with people that I might otherwise not. For that, it can be very good.</p>
<p>And yet… it struck a chord with, me to some degree. I realised that Facebook has increasingly become more of a time sink than a pleasure. Not that I spend vast amounts of time on it each day, but when I do open it up, I often end up spending longer than I’d have wanted to. And not reading updates from friends and family, but following links to articles and quizzes and nonsense, most of which I wish I hadn’t bothered with.</p>
<p>By comparison, a similar length of time spent in my feed reader lets me read blog pieces by people I actively want to hear from, and which I’m generally glad I’ve read.</p>
<p>But they mostly aren’t friends and family.</p>
<p>And then there’s the fact that the Facebook algorithm is tuned to show me what <em>it</em> thinks I should see, not what <em>I</em> want to see. What I want to see is all the updates from my friends, in reverse-chronological order. And that’s all. But there’s no guarantee that it will show me everything everyone posts, and the order is close to random at times.</p>
<p>One way to work round this is to visit people’s individual Facebook pages. You could see all your the posts by all your friends by going to each of their profiles in turn. But that would mean you’d have to keep track of all that: remember who you visited and when, and somehow manage the list of people.</p>
<p>Keeping track of things is what computers are good at. The software should be doing that for us.</p>
<p>So I’m thinking that what I want is an app that will do that for me: that will keep a list of my Facebook friends, and show me all their posts (which of course is what Facebook used to do).</p>
<p>As far as I know, no such app exists. This seems strange and unlikely, but I don’t think Facebook make a public API available for third-party clients, so such an app would have to work by scraping the web pages, which is neither good practice nor much fun.</p>
<p>Of course, what this means is effectively turning Facebook back into a set of RSS feeds — or now, <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/07/24/some-open-source-software-for-your-delectation/">especially as I have some experience with them</a>, a set of <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed feeds</a>. Which would then be usable in all sorts of other places.</p>
<p>Web scraping may be bad and painful; still, I think I want to write this thing. Watch this space.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Today I chanced to see an email in which a manager was asking his staff to work for extra hours. Well, ‘asking’ is putting it generously, to be honest. There didn’t seem to be much that was optional about it.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter connection, though: you’ll be familiar with the idea of ‘stretch goals.’ If not, the idea is that the basic target is to make X amount of money, but if we make X + 10%, or whatever, we’ll be able to do these other things. Develop additional features, make the item in more colours, or whatever. My guess is that the term originally comes from sports.</p>
<p>So this email included in the subject the phrase ‘stretch targets.’ Meaning we want you to do more this week/month/whatever, than we originally planned. It was clearly written by someone who thinks that the way to develop software faster is to work your staff to the bone. When in fact that’s much more likely to result in people taking shortcuts and making mistakes.</p>
<p>In this team they’re <em>already</em> working weekends, and now they’re being ‘stretched’ even more. It bodes ill. But perhaps co-opting the language of positive things for something so negative is worse.</p>

			 <html><body><h2>Past</h2>
<p>I can remember when I first saw <cite>Star Trek</cite>.</p>
<p>That’s not so unusual, but if my memory is right — and I’ve just more or less confirmed that it is — then when I first saw it was the absolute first time anyone <em>could</em> see it, in this country, at least.</p>
<p>Here’s the memory (and it’s tied up, as many good things are, with <cite>Doctor Who</cite>).</p>
<p>It’s 1969. It’s the summer holidays, and we’re in a holiday home with a TV. That in itself makes me doubt the memory, because back then holiday houses just didn’t have TVs. A lot of houses in general didn’t. But this memory has always told me that we were on a family holiday. And it’s Saturday, late afternoon. I’m settling down at the TV, and somebody says — I think it’s my sister — ‘Martin, <cite>Doctor Who</cite> finished, remember?’ Because it was <cite>Doctor Who</cite> time.</p>
<p>And I said, ‘But this is <em>like</em> <cite>Doctor Who</cite>!’</p>
<p>And as the new programme started someone else — my Dad, I think — said, with a tone of surprise, ‘He knows all about it!’ And then the <cite>Enterprise</cite> swooshed towards me out of the screen.</p>
<p>I’ve long wondered how true this memory was. It was 1969; I’d have been five. But I just <a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/BBC">checked</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Initially, the BBC was the first-run broadcaster of Star Trek (12 July 1969-15 December 1971).<br>
  …<br>
  The series was shown in four seasons, the first on Saturday evenings at 5:15 pm (in the time slot usually taken by Doctor Who).
</p></blockquote>
<p>Which exactly matches my memory: summer, Saturday, <cite>Doctor Who</cite> slot. And the calendar confirms that the 12th of July 1969 was a Saturday.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be five for another month plus. Not a bad bit of early-memory retention. I wouldn’t have remembered it at all, if it wasn’t for one thing: trauma caused by fear that my parents would turn the TV off just as this exciting new programme was starting burned it into my brain.</p>
<p>My Dad always liked <cite>Star Trek</cite> too, so I guess I was partly responsible for that.</p>
<h2>Present</h2>
<p>Yesterday I watched the first two episodes of <cite>Star Trek: Discovery</cite>, which are on Netflix (in the UK and Europe, at least; in the US they’re on CBS’s own new streaming service). And I really enjoyed it. I wouldn’t say it felt like being that nearly-five-year-old again, but it did feel like they’re trying something new and potentially very exciting.</p>
<p>Today I was looking at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5171438/?ref_=nv_sr_1">its entry on IMDB</a>. It turns out there are user-written reviews there, which I don’t think I’d been aware of before.</p>
<p>Sadly they are almost universally negative. ‘It’s not <cite>Star Trek</cite>,’ is a common theme. But there’s a strong whiff of racism and misogyny coming through. Two non-white women as leads means ‘social justice warriors’ are running the show, it seems. Well from what I’ve read of Gene Roddenbery, I think he’d have been happy to be called a social justice warrior. <cite>Star Trek</cite> was <em>always</em> about diversity and tolerance.</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>I don’t know how many episodes of this new series they have lined up, but I know I’m looking forward to watching them. So is my inner five-year-old. So would my Dad have been. And so would Gene.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Yes, the end of August and only my fourth book. What on Earth is happening? In short, Alan Moore’s <cite>Jerusalem</cite> is happening. All 1000-plus pages of it. I’m just over two-thirds of the way through it, and I’m loving it, but I think my target now must be to finish it by the end of the year!</p>
<p>But I got this one for my birthday, and it’s short, so I read it in two or three days while I was on holiday recently. It’s an odd one. It tells a story of some people and some strange videos in the days when there were still video rental <del datetime="2017-09-01T22:04:16+00:00">shops</del> stores and VHS tapes within them. Which allows someone to insert extracts from strange home videos into some of them, leading our protagonist to start investigating.</p>
<p>It takes place in the farmland of Iowa, and it’s interesting enough, but it’s one of those stories where you end up wondering, <em>Why?</em> Both why did the characters behave like that, and why did the author choose to write that particular story?</p>
<p>Not a bad story, but not that compelling either.</p>

Instead it was a reply to a comment on <a href="">Micro.blog</a>. But something went wrong and I posted it without the reply’s @-name at the start so it appeared as a full-fledged post, and got crossposted to Twitter and Facebook as usual.</p>
<p>I’m going to leave it in place as a learning experience.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>If you work with plain text, as I prefer to, then you probably try out different text editors from time to time (or, you know, constantly). I recently tried out a nice one called <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com">Bear</a>. It’s an attractive environment to write in, syncs well between Mac, iPhone, and iPad, has good previewing and exporting features, as well as a host of different themes to suit your preferences. All in all, it’s got a lot going for it. I used it exclusively for a while, and paid the first month of its subscription.</p>
<p>But I’m dropping it.</p>
<p>The reason why is simple: although it’s all about plain text notes, it doesn’t store your notes as plain text <em>files</em>. Instead, it keeps them all in some kind of database and syncs that via iCloud.</p>
<p>Using iCloud for syncing isn’t a problem, but locking my notes away in a form that’s not accessible to any other text editor definitely is.</p>
<p>Its export features are good, so it’s not that your notes are locked away irretrievably. But while you’re using Bear, you can only edit your notes — or view them, for that matter — <em>in</em> Bear. And that’s just not how I want to work.</p>
<p>It’s kind of antithetical to whole plain-text ethos, to my mind. You should be able to switch text editors without having to even think about it. Just open the file in the new editor and get on with it.</p>
<p>Next I tried the unimaginatively-named <a href="https://www.notebooksapp.com">Notebooks</a>. A similar setup with the syncing, but you can point it at a directory of files on the filesystem. It has its own strangenesses, though, in that it wants to keep tight control of the directory structure, and when you look at the directory in Finder or another text editor, you find it has been polluted with <code>plist</code> files, one for each plain-text file.</p>
<p>So I dumped that one, too.</p>
<p>And right now I’m trying <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a>, which is very much of the moment, because it has just switched to subscription-based pricing, and caused much furore in doing so. I happen to also be trying out the <a href="https://setapp.com">SetApp</a> service, which is interesting in itself, and which includes Ulysses as one of the apps it makes available.</p>
<p>It’s fine, but is also prone to dropping the odd <code>plist</code> file in my folder, I see.</p>
<p>In the end I’ll probably stick with <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a> for short-form notes on the Mac, using a folder synced via Dropbox, and <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a> on iOS. Not forgetting <a href="https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> on iOS, of course, but you only type things there to export them somewhere else, really. And then <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html">BBEdit</a> or <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> for longer pieces.</p>
<p>Those last two might become the subject of another piece, about how I don’t get what’s so great about BBEdit.  But that’s for another time.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I have made a thing, and pushed it out into the world. Well, really, this is me pushing it out into the world, because nobody will have noticed it before now, and with this, there’s a chance they might.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago <a href="https://manton.org">Manton Reece</a> and <a href="http://inessential.com/">Brent Simmons</a> announced the existence of <a href="https://jsonfeed.org">JSON Feed</a>, a new syndication format to sit alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Atom</a>; but using <a href="http://json.org">JavaScript Object Notation</a> or JSON, instead of XML.</p>
<p>They invited people to write parsers and formatters and so on for it, and I quickly realised that no-one had yet written one in Java. As far as I can tell that is still the case. Or at least, if they have, they haven’t made it public yet.</p>
<p>No-one, that is, but me, as I have written just such a thing: a JSON Feed parsing library, written in Java. I’m calling it <a href="http://tinlion.software/products/pertwee/">Pertwee</a>. That’s the product page at my company site (more on which later). It’s open-source, and can be found <a href="https://github.com/devilgate/pertwee">at Github</a></p>
<p>As software projects go, it’s not that exciting. But it is the first open-source project that I’ve released. I hope someone might find some use for it.</p>

<p>You’ll recall, being the avid reader of this blog that you are, that a while ago — OK, six years ago — I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/11/04/88-lines-about-the-end-of-reasons-to-leave-the-elements/">wrote about a great song</a> called ’88 Lines About 44 Women’ by a band called The Nails. I know nothing else by them, but the idea of seeing that song live in a tiny basement club is pretty cool.</p>
<p>But I had my suspicions. Especially when the first comment on the Songkick page was all about how it was the loudest gig they’d ever been at. Clicked through to the <a href="https://www.songkick.com/artists/189950-nails">band’s page</a>, played the video there, and it was immediately obvious that the hardcore band Nails are not indie/new wave/whatever band The Nails.</p>
<p>Just goes to show the difference a definite article can make. Nails sound pretty good, but I don’t think I’ll be going.</p>

			 <p>My iPhone 6 was getting slow, and its battery was poor. I have been thinking of replacing it. But September is approaching, and Apple will announcing new iPhones (three new ones, according to rumours). So I had more or less set my mind on waiting till then.</p>
<p>That would also be consistent with my iPhone buying history: 3G, 4S, 6… the next in the sequence is 7S.</p>
<p>Friday changed my plans. I was standing at a bus stop on Old Street, just replying to a WhatsApp message. Something touched my hand, and for half a second I thought someone was bumping into me. Then there was a firm grip on my phone and it was gone. Pulled right out of my hand and off down the road on a moped — which must have come across the pavement from behind me.</p>
<p>I should have been more aware. I knew this kind of theft was a thing. We’ve been hearing about them for a few months. But you don’t always think about it, and you never think it’s going to happen to you. And, yes, OK, drink had been taken. But not that much.</p>
<p>The bus arrived a few seconds later, so there was nothing I could do but get on and head home. There was another guy at the stop who witnessed it, and he very kindly set up a hotspot on his phone and let me use it from my iPad. The Find My iPhone app didn’t find it, so the thief had probably turned it off right away. But I was able to request a remote wipe in case it’s ever turned back on, and I got an email from Apple saying all the card details had been removed from Apple Pay.</p>
<p>All of which meant I had to make a trip to the Apple Store on Saturday. And to the Three store, where it was alarmingly easy to get a replacement SIM. I just had to tell them my phone number and give them a payment card. No questions asked. Not even my name and address.</p>
<p>So I now have  jet black 256 GB iPhone 7. Which is lovely. I’m late to all the new features, obviously, but here’s a quick rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>TouchID: it’s now <em>insanely</em> fast to unlock my phone. Seems like it’s almost before I touch the home button sometimes.</li>
<li>3D Touch: people on podcasts seem to be saying they’ve stopped using this, but I’m loving it. Especially the edge-press for activating the app switcher (a feature which seems to be going away in iOS 11, I hear, so I probably shouldn’t get too used to it).</li>
<li>The haptic feedback generally. Little clicks that tell you when you’ve activated something. Just makes the whole experience much <em>nicer</em>.</li>
<li>The “taptic” home button. When I’ve tried this in the shop before now I wasn’t too sure about it. But a couple of days using it for real and I think maybe I prefer it to the feel of the old real button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, it’s black. Really, really black.</p>
<p>Even the box was black.</p>
<p>The cables are still white, of course. Which reminds me, I’ve always disliked Apple’s ear buds, and passed all my past ones on to my kids. But I thought I’d give these a try, not least because I wouldn’t mind trying the AirPods if they’re ever in stock anywhere,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and they have the same form factor.</p>
<p>And I don’t hate them. I thought I always had trouble getting them to stay in, but that doesn’t seem to be the case now. The main problem is they don’t give enough sound isolation, so you can hear the traffic and people talking even with music or a podcast playing. I’ve always preferred the kind with rubbery tips, which form a seal. But aside from that, these are better than I expected. Which bodes well for AirPods.</p>
<p>Downside: the battery life doesn’t seem dramatically better than my old one, weirdly. For the first couple of days it was busy downloading updates and restoring things (and getting hot), but that should be over now. I’m assuming that I just have to give it a few full cycles till it beds in and the measurement gets more accurate.</p>
<p>And all the things you have to set up again. That’s not the fault of the phone, though, so much as the way it came to me. If had planned this I would have done an encrypted iTunes backup, which would have meant more things were restored to the new phone.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was a lot of words and no links about not very much.</p>

<h2 id="calling-the-election">Calling the Election</h2>
<p>Calling the election at all was at best a cynical ploy by Theresa May. Labour looked weak. She thought she could get a hugely increased majority for relatively little effort. So despite her repeated promises that should would not, she called a general election.</p>
<p>Now, however, it might have backfired on her. The polls have shifted (though we know we can’t trust polls). Quite dramatically by some measures. It’s looking like she might end up with a <em>reduced</em> majority. Or even — dare we hope? — a radical change. A Labour majority seems implausible, but a hung parliament? That’s beginning to look a lot like a real possibility.</p>
<h3 id="the-fixed-term-parliaments-act">The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act</h3>
<p>But what of the act that was supposed to remove prime-ministerial whim from the choice of election date? It turns out it wasn’t worth the paper it was printed on. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011">Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011</a> contains a clause that allows the current government to call an election if it has the support of the house.</p>
<p>Not, I note, with a simple majority. Obviously that would be ridiculous for anything really important. No, a two-thirds majority is needed.</p>
<p>And was easily obtained, owing to the failure of the opposition to oppose; and now May wants to repeal it anyway. But more on both of those later.</p>
<h2 id="brexit">Brexit</h2>
<p>When the election was called, my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/04/18/scattered-thoughts-on-the-general-election/">initial reaction</a> was that it would be all about Brexit. Nothing else loomed so large. And that was why I had concerns about Labour, because Jeremy Corbyn seemed committed to carrying on the madness that the referendum started.</p>
<p>I wrote then:</p>
<blockquote><p>
[P]eople will be torn between voting on the normal things they care about: health, security, homes, welfare, the economy… — and the big thing of our time: Brexit.<br>
…<br>
I can’t in conscience vote for a Labour party that won’t clearly place itself against Brexit. I just can’t. This means I have to leave the party, I guess. Corbyn called today for “A Brexit that works for all.” No, no, no.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn’t leave the party, and though there’s still some truth in that, things have changed. I’m not entirely sure when, or how; but somewhere along the line — the publication of the manifestos was certainly part of it — the normal things began to matter again. They never stopped mattering, of course, but they came back into focus.</p>
<p>One of the normal things in particular: the NHS.</p>
<h2 id="saving-the-nhs">Saving the NHS</h2>
<p>The Tories — modern Tories, at least — have never really supported it. They have always pushed privatisation of it, or as much of it as possible. Though to be fair, the last Labour government at fault there too, with their public-private partnerships.</p>
<p>Tories, of course, have pushed for privatisation in everything, not just the NHS, at least since Thatcher. But even Thatcher kept her hands off the NHS. Not so this lot. Thatcher didn’t leave much to privatise, so their eyes are firmly on the last great publicly owned body.</p>
<p>I fear that if May’s lot get back in, especially with an increased majority, we could see the beginning of the end of free universal healthcare in the UK. We are in that much danger.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-corbyn-past-present">Thoughts on Corbyn, past &amp; present</h2>
<p>I voted for Corbyn as leader twice. I had my doubts, but he always seemed to be on the right side; and as well, there was no good alternative (not the second time, anyway).</p>
<h3 id="around-the-referendum">Around the Referendum</h3>
<p>Then I felt totally let down by Brexit &amp; after. To be fair, his “trigger Article 50 now” comments were slightly misinterpreted, but expressing himself like that just added to the idea that he couldn’t handle himself with the media.</p>
<p>And that was certainly true in the first several months. It was like he — the party as a whole — had no media management at all.</p>
<p>And at no time did he resist Brexit.</p>
<h3 id="post-referendum">Post Referendum</h3>
<p>Then there was a series of mistakes, or bad decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The three-line whip on the first Article 50 vote.</li>
<li>Not resisting the invocation of Article 50 at all, even when criticising it.</li>
<li>Waving through the vote to have the election. Because even if he didn’t want to stop it, how much better would it have been to make the Tories call a vote of no confidence? If only for the <em>schadenfreude</em>.</li>
<li>Then he chose not to join the debate because May wasn’t involved? That’s what we call missing an open goal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-big-improvement">The Big Improvement</h3>
<p>Things have — and he has — got so much better since then. Somewhere along the line he started to come across as the dignified, statesmanlike man of principle that we knew he was. What changed? Was it better media management, or did the media actually start to give him some proper time?</p>
<p>I don’t know, but the result is that the polls have turned round dramatically, giving rise to a measure of that most terrifying of things: <em>hope</em>.</p>
<h3 id="manifesto-destiny">Manifesto Destiny</h3>
<p>Everything in the Labour manifesto is better for the country than everything in the Tory one. It’s as simple as that. “For the many, not the few” is the tag line they’ve been using, and it’s great. Simple, to the point, meaningful. And accurate.</p>
<p>Not to mention costed. No “magic money tree” here.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-brexit">Back to Brexit</h3>
<p>Although they haven’t said so, I could see a Labour government offering a second referendum. At least you can imagine them being more open to considering the possibility. Especially, of course, if they were in coalition.</p>
<p>Now that takes us to the next question: if it’s a hung parliament, can we trust the LibDems not to back the Tories again?</p>
<p>I mean, surely, this time… But that’s what we thought he last time, and look where that got us. So it’s a worry. But the LibDems are likely to get some of their old seats back, and Labour almost certainly can’t get a majority with the way things have changed in Scotland, so a coalition is our best hope.</p>
<h2 id="may-madness">May Madness</h2>
<p>Now let’s turn our attention to our gloryless leader.</p>
<p>Theresa May has presented an increasingly bizarre face to the world over the last few weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her “Me, me, me” approach to presenting Tory policy (“If I lose six seats…” you only get one); that’s not how politics in the UK works.</li>
<li>She wants to reverse the country’s stumbling steps toward better voting systems, such as the proportional system for the London Mayor.</li>
<li>Politicising the terrorist attacks:
<ul>
<li>first troops on the streets, <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/05/27/losing-the-war-on-terror/">as I discussed</a>;</li>
<li>and now she wants to tear up human rights legislation. Next it’ll be internment, I shouldn’t wonder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She was seemingly scared to debate the other party leaders on TV. Debates may not be quite standard in British elections yet, but that is the way the world was moving.</li>
<li>Oh, and along with voting reversals, she wants to <em>repeal</em> the fixed-term parliaments act, for what little use it was.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, it seems like she just wants to go backwards to an imagined Little-England past.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It won’t surprise you in the slightest to hear that I’m strongly advocating voting <em>against</em> the Tories, in whatever way you can have the most effect. I will be voting Labour, of course, but then I live in one of the safest Labour seats in the country, so that doesn’t have a lot of effect.</p>
<p>However, I’ll also be joining other Labour members from Hackney tomorrow in heading over to Westminster North, which is a Labour marginal. I’ll be helping to get out the vote there.</p>
<p>To you I say, please vote. Vote to stop the Tory mayhem. Vote to save the NHS.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I didn’t intend to discuss these two episodes of <cite>Doctor Who</cite> together, but watching the first was delayed because I was <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/05/21/3446/">in Scotland</a> when the first one was on. And I didn’t realise they were a two-parter.</p>
<p>Except (spoilers) — oh, they’re not. They’re the first two of an <em>n</em>-parter, where <em>n</em> equals… who knows? At least three, and I’m sort of guessing from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_10)">titles and directors</a> that it might be four.</p>
<p>Anyway, in them we have one really good episode, one not so good.</p>
<p>Episode 6, “Extremis,” was really very good indeed. Right up there with the best of this series so far. And good to get the mystery of the vault revealed early on, rather than letting it drag on to the end of the season and be an anticlimax.</p>
<p>Episode 7, “The Pyramid at the End of the World,” despite the great title, was weaker, largely because of scientific irrationality and foolish plotting. To say nothing of incredibly lax biosecurity.</p>
<p>That said, I did enjoy it while watching it. It’s one of those ones where a little bit more care, a few easily-insertable words, and it would all have held together much better. The problem with bad science or plotting based on foolish mistakes is that they can dump you out of the story. Critical faculties should be engaged <em>after</em> you’ve watched a show, not unceremoniously force-invoked by something happening onscreen.</p>
<p>Never mind, though: the next one looks very interesting.</p>

			 <html><body><p>The front page of today’s <cite>Guardian</cite> has a picture of what it looks like when you let the terrorists win:</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/96237412_27may1national01-1-1.jpg" alt="96237412 27may1national01  1" title="_96237412_27may1national01 (1).jpg" border="0" width="330" height="257"></p>
<p>Armed police used to be almost unknown on British streets. Now they’re becoming alarmingly commonplace. I saw two outside Liverpool Street Station yesterday; armed, like the two above, not just with pistols, but with big, two handed things that most people would call “machine guns.” This increasing militarisation of the police was taken a step further this week when the Maybot ordered actual troops onto the streets. And I read that armoured vehicles were going to be deployed at the FA Cup final.</p>
<p>Armed police on a beach: why? Was there a reasonable expectation of some sort of attack on <em>Scarborough beach</em>? And if there was: would weapons have helped? Armed police would not have stopped the tragedy in Manchester.</p>
<p>The aim of the terrorist is to cause terror. All this escalation does is make ordinary people feel more worried, more scared. Worry and low-grade fear aren’t terror, but they’re on the same axis. Overreacting like this is playing into the terrorists’ hands. As well, of course, as being a cynical political move in the runup to an election whose calling was, itself, a cynical political move.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn gave speech <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/25/jeremy-corbyn-links-foreign-policy-to-growing-terror-threat">making reasonable, uncontentious points about</a> the links between foreign policy and terrorism. Predictably the right-wing press and Tory politicians went ape.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>I got an email from the BBC today, telling me that <a href="https://store.bbc.com/customer-info">the BBC Store is closing</a> in November. Oddly, they don’t explain why. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/25/bbc-store-closing-november/">This Engadget article</a> says it’s because “people prefer streaming.”</p>
<p>At least, that’s what the headline says. The article actually says the decision comes “following poor sales and tough competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Video.”</p>
<p>Which is plausible enough, I suppose. Though I doubt that most people could explain the difference between a streaming service and one in which you have to download the file first. And in any case, Netflix and I think Amazon also allow you to download now.</p>
<p>In fact my guess would be more that people prefer subscriptions. Amazon and Netflix are compelling because once your monthly fee is paid you can always watch anything they have. With the Store you had to buy specific titles, and there’s always that hesitation about paying before you watch something.</p>
<p>I only ever used it to watch a couple of episodes of something I had left too late to see on iPlayer. specifically, one episode of <cite>Undercover</cite>. Apparently I spent £1.89, and I’ll be getting a £2.50 Amazon voucher to make up for it. Whee, an investment.</p>
<p>So I guess I was part of the poor sales.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is the opinion of some — and it would be of many in Britain, I imagine — that BBC programmes should just be available. We shouldn’t have to pay for them again. “We’re not just listeners and viewers, it belongs to us,” as a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q2iZuU5WM">great man once sang</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s the solution to the arguments over funding: treat the licence fee as a subscription charge. Increase it, make it optional, but include access to the BBC’s entire back catalogue.</p>
<p>But the Engadget article goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If the rumours are true, BritBox — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/07/bbc-itv-britbox-streaming-service-launch/">the BBC- and ITV-owned streaming service that launched in the US earlier this year</a> — could be expanded to host more of the BBC’s back catalogue and eventually launch in the UK.
</p></blockquote>
<p>BBC <em>and</em> ITV? Together? Well I never.</p>

			 <p>Back to form, then, with <cite>Doctor Who</cite> season 10 episode 4, “Oxygen.” Jamie Mathieson has written some good episodes before, and he keeps up the standard here. A tale of capitalism red in tooth and claw, it reminds us at times of “Silence in the Library,” and also of Duncan Jones’s <cite>Moon</cite>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It’s a “monster of the week” episode, but the monster is capitalism. This season so far has been surprisingly political. Well, maybe not surprisingly. These are politically-charged times, and science fiction is nothing if not of its time.</p>
<p>There are no particularly egregious pieces of nonsense here, either. Why the suit’s force-field helmets are OK inside the station but not enough outside isn’t really explained, but the real reason is so the actors don’t have to wear helmets for the whole episode, so that’s all right.</p>
<p>Oh, one thing: they’re on a space station: what are they mining? I mean, <em>for</em> copper, but <em>in</em> what? We have to assume it’s asteroids, but they could just have said.</p>
<p>The really interesting stuff is what we might call the “arc” material (if we are harking back to our <cite>Babylon 5</cite> days). The shades are back, but only because The Doctor is blind now. Can he fix it by regenerating, maybe? Or by doing a partial regeneration, like Ten? And more about the vault and The Doctor’s oath. Nardole fears what would happen “if that door opens.” But we saw it open last week, so things are not quite as Nardole thinks, at least.</p>
<p>And the very last scene in the “Next Time…” Yes!</p>

			 <html><body><p>Well, I suppose they couldn’t sustain the excellence forever. I mean, there’s bound to be the odd weaker episode, right? “Knock Knock”, <cite>Doctor Who</cite> season 10 episode 3 is certainly that. I have to say it’s the weakest episode we’ve seen so far this season.</p>
<p>This is largely because it doesn’t make much sense. Alien bugs turning people to wood? And back again? Well, I guess it’s no more preposterous than many things we’ve seen, but you need to have some semblance of a rationale, and this had none.</p>
<p>Plus it had less of what has really been making this season great: the Doctor/Bill interaction.</p>
<p>Still, it had an interesting season-arc-related ending, with the Doctor taking Mexican food into the Mysterious Vault to share with whoever is in there. And we now it is a “who:” they were playing the piano. And they eat, presumably.</p>
<p>I think there are two possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since The Doctor mentioned regeneration, and we know he’s going to regenerate this season, it’s something to with that. Like a future version of himself, for reasons to be explained.</li>
<li>As I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/05/05/the-luxury-of-outrage/">said before</a>, it’s The Master, or Missy, since we saw both the latter and the John Simm version of the former in the season trailer. That would be plausible but weird.</li>
<li>Or, and this occurred to me just tonight: what if it’s Susan? His granddaughter from right back at the beginning? Her photograph was on his desk in the first episode… but that’s just fanciful, and why would he have her in a vault?</li>

			 <p>Earlier today I added a <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/05/06/3370/">short microblog post in which I called Nigel Farage a traitor</a>. Its a strong word, and maybe one that I shouldn’t throw around so casually.</p>
<p>I don’t really go in for patriotism, nationalism, and all that kind of thing. But I do want Britain — the country I live in, was born in, and am a citizen of — to be the best country it can be. On the assumption that most citizens would have a similar desire, it seems reasonable to me to think that a citizen who acts against that desire — against the country’s best interests — is betraying the country.</p>
<p>Nigel Farage has made it his life’s work to get Britain to leave the European Union, and has been successful in making (or at least starting)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that happen.</p>
<p>Leaving the EU is not in the best interests of the country.</p>
<p>Therefore Nigel Farage has been working against the best interests of the country. Therefore he is a traitor.</p>
<p>It’s a simple syllogism.</p>
<p>Of course, he’s far from alone in this. I count Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and, of course, Theresa May in the same group. And many more.</p>
<p>Indeed, you could argue that anyone who voted to leave the EU is similarly guilty, but that seems unfair. Many knew exactly what they were doing, of course. But many also (possibly many more) were duped.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean much if I name these people as traitors, but it’s worth recording what my thinking was behind using that term</p>

			 <p>The Doctor is a burning sun of outrage, but claims never to have had time for it. Season 10, episode 3, “Thin Ice,” sends him and Bill into London’s past, to 1814, and the last great frost fair on the frozen Thames.</p>
<p>There is a beast below the ice<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> There is a racist lord. There are cute dirty-faced urchins, and acrobats, and a fleeting glimpse of an elephant.</p>
<p>I loved almost everything about this episode. In fact the only negative point to me was the use of the old diving suits. You need someone onshore, operating an air pump, to use those, and there was no evidence of such a thing. It’s one of those things that <cite>Doctor Who</cite> is prone to. Not a big deal in this case, but it wouldn’t have hard to have included a few words about The Doctor modifying them with a compact air supply, or something.</p>
<p>No matter, as I say, it was an almost perfect episode. And we got back to The Doctor’s office at the end, where Nardole was making the tea (with added coffee for flavour).</p>
<p>And who or what is in the mysterious vault? The knocking of course echo’s “He will knock four times,” at the end of Tennant’s run, and that was The Master. And we know that The Master — or at least John Simm — as well as Missy, is gong to be in this season.</p>
<p>But it would be very strange if it were him in the vault.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Episode 2 of <cite>Doctor Who</cite> Season 10, “Smile,” featured emoji-faced robots (<a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/robot/">or not strictly robots</a>), as well as Bill’s first real trip in the Tardis and into (as is proper) the future.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a great story, but it was a good one, and I think it was a great opportunity for character interactions.</p>
<p>Complaints would be that The Doctor was too quick to leap to the “blow it up” solution (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier_Lethbridge-Stewart">shades of Lethbridge-Stewart</a>, maybe); and that the pacing dropped off badly in the last third, with The Doc taking ages to explain things long after it was obvious that he just needed to reprogram the robots.</p>
<p>Still, it was, as I say, great character work — Bill is shaping up to be an excellent companion — and an amazing location. I heard that the main building is <a href="http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-04-22/visit-doctor-whos-spectacular-colony-world-in-valencia#">in Valencia</a>, and parts of it looked an awful lot like the Eden Project.</p>
<p>I also like that the episodes are continuing one into the next. Will they carry that on through the whole season? Could they? <em>Should</em> they?</p>

			 <html><body><p>Back in Balloch in 1981, 82 or so we use to play a Pac-Man clone called Spout Rolla. But there are no references to it on the internet, as far as I can tell. So this is my story about it.</p>
<p>Once upon a time a gang of kids — thinking they were adults, but not really — used to go to the pub, and play a game.</p>
<p>The pub was actually the bar of a place called <a href="http://www.duckbay.co.uk">Duck Bay Marina</a>. I see from that link that they now call it “Duck Bay Hotel.” Either way, it was a couple of miles outside Balloch, on the west bank of Loch Lomond.</p>
<p>Why did we go there, when there were pubs in the town? Two reasons, I suspect. One, some of us had driving licences and the chance to use our parents’ cars, so why not? (I wasn’t yet one of them at that point.) And two, it had video games in the foyer.</p>
<p>That had a dual advantage. We could play the games, and those of us who, let’s say, weren’t quite strictly within the parameters of the legal drinking age, could stay out of sight of the staff.</p>
<p>So: usually two machines, as I recall, plus maybe a fruit machine or two. I first played Frogger there. It was the era when arcade games had started to extend beyond shooting things in space to other tests of skill, like crossing rivers on logs.</p>
<p>Spout Rolla was in a similar vein. But it was a clear derivative of — let’s be honest, rip-off of — Pac-Man. I’m not sure I’d actually played Pac-Man at that point, but I must have been aware of it.</p>
<p>The idea was you guided a paint brush moving around a watery maze, painting the maze behind it. Fish would come out and try to catch your brush. If you painted all the maze you got a new screen (which I think might just have been the same maze in different colours, maybe speeded up a bit).</p>
<p>Instead of the power-pills of Pac-Man, there was one part of the maze that had a paint roller in it. If you approached the roller from the right direction, it went with you and you accelerated just for that section. Then you could turn back and roll over the fish that were following you, for extra points. And that was it.</p>
<p>Simpler times, simpler pleasures, I guess. It never made much sense, but we liked it.</p>
<p>Thing is, everything’s on the net today, right? Well, apparently not. When I googled it today, I found two surprising thing. First, that there are no references to “Spout Rolla game” to be found, with or without quotes round the first two words. Second, that <a href="https://mapcarta.com/17620080">Spout Rolla is a place in Scotland</a>, namely a waterfall in Perth and Kinross.<sup id="fnref-3345-waterfall"><a href="#fn-3345-waterfall" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Could this possibly be that most unlikely of things (at least before Rockstar Games): a Scottish game?</p>
<p>My son suggested that there would be people my age trying to remember what the game was called. So I tried googling for a description of it: <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pac-man+clone+fish+paint+roller&amp;t=ipad&amp;ia=videos">pac-man clone fish paint roller</a>. That search has selected videos, which I didn’t. But I did find a possible explanation.</p>
<p>It seems there was a game called <a href="https://archive.org/details/arcade_crush">Crush Roller, also known as Make Trax</a>, and the one I remember could be a rebadged version of that. Plus you can play it at that link. As with many games of the time, it’s not as satisfying playing them with arrow keys as it was with a joystick.</p>
<p>So, no, it’s not Scottish, but it could possibly have been rebadged for the Scottish market. Or maybe just that one in Duck Bay, who knows.</p>
<p>The only thing is that, seeing that version, I had forgotten about there being <em>two</em> rollers. I was fairly sure there was only one, but playing it felt familiar, so I guess Crush Roller/Make Trax is it.</p>

Initially the only <a href="https://sv.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spout_Rolla">Wikipedia page for it</a> I could find was in Swedish. But latterly (2019-12-08), I find it’s better known as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sput_Rolla">Sput Rolla</a>.” According to the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_waterfalls_of_Scotland">List of waterfalls of Scotland</a>” article, “‘Spout’ is another common word found throughout England and Scotland for particular types of fall though it is usually replaced by ‘sput’ in the formerly Gaelic-speaking parts of the latter.” <a href="#fnref-3345-waterfall">↩</a>

			 <h2 id="an-election-unlike-any-other">An Election Unlike Any Other</h2>
<p>This election is going to be completely unique in our lifetime, probably ever. Because people will be torn between voting on the normal things they care about: health, security, homes, welfare, the economy… — and the big thing of our time: Brexit.</p>
<p>There were close to half the electorate who voted to stay in the EU (close to half the turnout, anyway). There’s no reason to suppose that any of those have changed their minds, even if many now talk in terms of acceptance. There are plenty who voted the other way who wish things had gone differently. And the non-voters are an unknown.</p>
<p>If a party — or a coalition — were to clearly stand on a platform of stopping Brexit, or even of promising a second referendum, they would be in a position unlike any party ever. Or so it seems to me.</p>
<p>Unfortunately only the Liberal Democrats seem to be even close to that position.</p></p>
<h2 id="i-cant-vote-labour">I Can’t Vote Labour</h2>
<p>I can’t in conscience vote for a Labour party that won’t clearly place itself against Brexit. I just can’t. This means I have to leave the party, I guess. Corbyn called today for “A Brexit that works for all.” No, no, no.</p>
<p>I imagine this means I’ll be voting Lib Dem. Possibly Green. I’m not sure where they stand yet. In one sense, of course, it doesn’t matter, as I live in one of the safest Labour seats, but that’s not really the point. I’ll be writing to Diane Abbot to explain my position, but I don’t imagine it will change hers, which is to support Corbyn, even though her constituency is one of the most pro-remain in the country.</p>
<p>I voted for Corbyn as leader twice, but he’s very disappointing now. Though I have to say that his policies on <em>literally everything else</em> would be dramatically better than the Tories.</p></p>
<h2 id="why-and-why-now">Why, and Why Now?</h2>
<p>Why has Mayhem changed her mind on a snap election, and why now? The obvious thing is the Tory lead in the polls, and to take advantage of Labour chaos. Nothing to with Brexit at all, not directly.</p>
<p>But something I was seeing on Facebook tonight was the idea that they were about to lose their majority, when the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) brings charges for electoral fraud against up to 30 Tory MPs. The prosecutions will still happen, but they won’t affect the position of MPs who get elected this time round (well, unless they get convicted, of course, but I’m guessing the Tories will quietly deselect the ones who are likely to go down).</p></p>
<h2 id="effect-of-fixed-term-parliaments-act">Effect of Fixed-Term Parliaments Act</h2>
<p>My first reaction was, “They can’t: what about the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act?” Turns out that contains a clause that lets the sitting parliament ignore it, as long as they get a two-thirds majority. The irony of that figure was not lost on me, as possibly my most-retweeted tweet shows:</p></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Snap general election called. Ironic that to ignore Fixed-Term Parliaments Act needs a two-thirds majority. Unlike, say, leaving the EU. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fb?src=hash">#fb</a>
<p>— Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/854281181864624129">April 18, 2017</a></p></blockquote></p>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Without Labour voting with the government they wouldn’t get that two-thirds. Corbyn has cheerfully agreed to go along, missing an open goal. First, the opposition should oppose the government, as a general principle. Unless the government is doing the right thing, which is not the case here. More amusingly, if they didn’t get the two-thirds, they would have to go for a vote of no confidence. That is, a Tory MP would have to stand up in the House of Commons and move that “This house has no confidence in Her Majesty’s Government.” Even if they could come back from that, Corbyn should have forced it just for the lulz.</p></p>

			 <html><body><p><cite>Doctor Who</cite> is back! And at Easter, which still feels like the right time of the year.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/11/28/raven-and-what/">as you’ll know</a>, I thought last season was the best season of New Who. I may have been being a tad hyperbolic there… but not entirely.</p>
<p>And now we’ve got “The Pilot,” the first episode of the new season. Introducing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4929530/">Pearl Mackie</a> as Bill Potts. Among other things, I’ve got to say that this would be a great jumping-on point; a fine episode for someone new to the series to start.</p>
<p>The story was good, not great; there were unnecessary Daleks, but if that means they’re going to otherwise be given a rest for this season, I won’t complain; and we’ve got the mysterious vault that The Doctor and Nardole are investigating. I suspect it might be most of the season before we find out what’s going on with that.</p>
<p>Nice references to the past with the pictures of River and Susan; and the people who were fighting the Daleks were <a href="tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Dalek-Movellan_War">Movellans</a>, apparently. I learned this on Jason Snell’s <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/teevee/doctorwho/">Doctor Who Flashcast</a> podcast. I knew I recognised them, so I thought they must be <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Thal">Thals</a>, and that we were right back at the start of it all. It’s a very long time since I saw either.</p>
<p>So, The Doctor has been lecturing at Bristol University for maybe fifty years? Intriguing. And the mini-trailer that we got as well as the usual “Next time…” is even more so. Both Missy and John Simm (presumably as The Master). The start of The Doctor’s regeneration sequence. We know he’s going to regenerate, but not, presumably till the last episode.</p>
<p>Though on that point, Capaldi said on <cite>The Graham Norton Show</cite> that he had already filmed his part of the regeneration scene, and the only thing they still had to film was the Christmas special. Not surprisingly he wouldn’t give an explanation of that paradox.</p>
<p>I have a theory, or suggestion for how things might develop. They won’t do this, and they shouldn’t; but bear with me.</p>
<p>In a reversal of the now-common trope of The Doctor’s companion falling for him, The Doctor falls for Bill. She, of course, is not interested. So The Doctor regenerates into a female form.</p>
<p>That would be to put Bill’s sexuality too much to the fore, and of course be wildly unlike The Doctor. But it amused me to consider for a few minutes.</p>

			 <html><body><p>In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/05/do-two-unpublished-books-make-you-a-failed-author-no-youre-a-quitter">recent article in the Guardian</a>, this appeared:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It is no one’s “destiny” to be a published author. That implies a path laid out for us, an unshakeable future that is planned and unchangeable. And it is entitled.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That is a perfectly normal use of the modern sense of the word “entitled,” and it still slightly bothers me, as it has lo! these several years.</p>
<p>Because what it really means is that the person isn’t actually entitled to the thing in question. The older sense of “entitle” is to have the right to something — literally to have the <em>title</em>.</p>
<p>The modern meaning — the “He’s so entitled” formulation — really means “He’s behaving as if he were entitled to…”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/entitle">Dictionary.com gives the definition of <em>entitle</em></a> as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  to give (a person or thing) a title, right, or claim to something; furnish with grounds for laying claim
</p></blockquote>
<p>Merriam-Webster is similar;</p>
<blockquote>
  1:  to give a title to :  designate<br>
  2:  to furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming something this ticket entitles the bearer to free admission
</blockquote>
<p>And neither has the modern meaning at all.</p>
<p>But I’m slightly horrified to find that the built-in dictionary in MacOS <em>only</em> has the modern meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
  adjective<br>
  believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment: kids who feel so entitled and think the world will revolve around them
</blockquote>
<p>It’s interesting, though, that its definition of <em>entitle</em> is similar to the two web-based ones. And <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/entitled">Cambridge</a> has <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/entitle">both</a>. It seems the difference is whether you use the verb or the adjective. The latter is the only one with the modern meaning.</p>
<p>Language changes, and that’s fine. But I wish that people who use it in the modern fashion understood what it is they’re saying, and what it can sound like they’re saying. I suspect they mostly don’t.</p>
<p>They’re behaving like they’re entitled to make words mean whatever they want.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Interrupting my Alan Moore reading to check on the short-fiction nominees for the <a href="http://www.bsfa.co.uk/bsfa-2016-awards-voting-form/">BSFA Awards</a>, reprinted as ever in an A4 booklet.</p>
<p>Good stuff, of course, but maybe not as good as last year (though I realised that I hadn’t read all of last year’s). Let’s go through them one by one.</p>
<p>Warning: spoilers follow.</p>
<h2>“The End of Hope Street,” by Malcolm Devlin</h2>
<p>This is a strange story, set in the present day, about houses becoming “unliveable.” This phenomenon is completely unexplained, but it is disastrous, and can even be fatal. And it accepted fatalistically by the large, and largely undifferentiated, cast of characters.</p>
<h2>“Liberty Bird,” by Jayne Fenn</h2>
<p>The favoured son of a noble clan races the family yacht. In spaaaaaace. But he has a shameful secret that should be neither in highly advanced future society. On the other hand, a highly advanced future society shouldn’t have a nobility. I guess societies can go back as well as forward.</p>
<h2>“Taking Flight,” by Una McCormack</h2>
<p>Another rich person mooches around with no real aim in life, this time in a society that has genetically engineered slaves.</p>
<h2>“Presence,” by Helen Oyeyemi</h2>
<p>This is the most disjointed, disconnected of the stories. A heterosexual married couple avoid communicating with each other because she’s convinced he’s about to leave her. Until they do, and it turns out instead that he wants to postpone their holiday so they can try out some sort of therapy for grieving people that he has developed. They do, and things get strange. There’s potential here, but all the initial setup about them not communicating is just ignored after they get to the point, so it could have mostly been left out. It really feels like it wants to be two or more different stories.</p>
<h2>“The Apologists,” by Tade Thompson</h2>
<p>A super-advanced alien race have accidentally killed all by five people of the human race. The five are put to work helping the aliens reconstruct a simulacrum of Earth, while a daily apology is blasted at them out of a sound system (hence the title). They seem surprisingly untraumatised by this situation.</p>
<h2>“The Arrival of Missives” (Extract), by Aliya Whiteley</h2>
<p>Not sure why this is an extract. Probably the original work is too long to fit in the booklet. A during the First World War a sixteen-year-old girl is in love with her teacher. She decides she has to let him know. The extract ends just when something out of the ordinary is revealed.</p>
<h2>Thoughts and Conclusions</h2>
<p>Well, I haven’t made them sound very good, have I? I did actually enjoy reading them all, but reduced to capsule summaries, they aren’t going to win any awards. Oh, wait…</p>
<p>I’ve no idea which one I’ll vote for.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This is a horrific quote from <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/17/margaret-atwood-the-prophet-of-dystopia"><cite>The New Yorker</cite>‘s interview with Margaret Atwood</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Mary Webster, whose neighbors, in the Puritan town of Hadley, Massachusetts, had accused her of witchcraft. ‘The townspeople didn’t like her, so they strung her up,’ Atwood said recently. ‘But it was before the age of drop hanging, and she didn’t die. She dangled there all night, and in the morning, when they came to cut the body down, she was still alive.’ Webster became known as Half-Hanged Mary.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But I can’t help thinking, if there’s anything to the story, wouldn’t they have taken her survival as <em>further evidence</em> of her witchy nature, and made sure they killed her next time? As it is, it sounds like she lived on.</p>

			 <p>Funny where thoughts of current affairs take you.</p>
<p>All the fawning (and, to be fair, condemnatory and neutral) coverage of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/trump-syria-missiles-assad-chemical-weapons">Trump’s bombardment of a Syrian air base</a> in response to Assad’s gas attack have stated the quantity and type of munition that was used: “59 Tomahawk Cruise missiles.”</p>
<p>Those of us who lived under the shadow of the mushroom cloud in the 80s will remember that missile. It was the one stationed at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Greenham_Common">Greenham Common</a>, which of course was the subject of much protest, mainly from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenham_Common_Women%27s_Peace_Camp">Women’s Peace Camp</a>.</p>
<p>The Greenham camp was primarily part of the anti-nuclear movement, as the missiles stationed there carried nuclear warheads. Obviously the ones the US launched a couple of nights ago didn’t, but what the whole thing did was remind me of a song from that time: “Tomahawk Cruise,” by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._V._Smith">TV Smith</a>‘s Explorers.</p>
<p>I recall hearing that song in my Dad’s car<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> back when it came out. It’s possible that I only heard it that one time, but it has stuck in my mind all these years, just waiting to be shaken loose.</p>
<p>On listening to it <a href="https://itun.es/gb/K-jlJ?i=590128273">on Apple Music</a> I’m pleased to find the chorus is almost exactly as I remembered. The rest of the lyrics are more oblique than I’d have expected. It was an anti-nuclear song, but less obviously than I’d have thought.</p>
<p>It’s very 80s, as you might expect (it was released in 1980), but there is, of course, nothing wrong with that. Inevitably it’s to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVqJIWQL5ww">found on YouTube</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/565WiGa4IE38mTUkJCkY9T">Spotify</a>.</p>
<p>Not sure whether this counts as nostalgia, in terms of my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/04/07/looking-back-and-forward/">post the other day</a>, but I don’t really care. What definitely isn’t, though, is the album I’m listening to as I type: <cite><a href="https://itun.es/gb/K-jlJ">The Chiswick Story</a></cite> by Various Artists<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (most of whom I haven’t heard) is a potted history of the label.

			 <html><body><p>Yesterday I kind of wilfully skipped a day. At some point in the evening I realised I wasn’t going to write a post, so I just said, “Fine: that’s allowed.”</p>
<p>Today I started by going for a swim. After my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/21/recent-events/">new regime of exercise last summer</a>, I got out of the habit once I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/02/recent-events-2/">started a new contract</a>. So it was good to get back to it. (Which is not to say I haven’t swum or gone to the gym in all that time, but it’s been a few weeks at the moment.)</p>
<p>After that I took a <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank test</a> for a new job opportunity. It’s a site that does programming tests. This one was, I suspect, a disaster. I hate doing that kind of thing: you’ve got a timer running, and the problem you’re trying to solve is unlike anything you’d have to do professionally… Anyway, suffice to say, it didn’t go terribly well.</p>
<p>This evening was all about falling asleep in front of the telly. We tried to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2920540/?ref_=nv_sr_1"><cite>20,000 Days On Earth</cite></a>, the film about Nick Cave from a few years back. I got it a few Christmases or birthdays ago, but hadn’t got round to watching it till now. I enjoyed what I saw of it, but there was definite falling asleep on the sofa and missing chunks. Oh well, it’s a DVD: we can always go back.</p>
<p>Oh yes: there was also a trip to Westfield, the time-void where hours go to die.</p>

			 <p>My recent and forthcoming live music experiences all involve bands of my youth that have reformed and are touring their old material.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Wallowing in nostalgia, some might call it.</p>
<p>But there’s nothing inherently wrong with bands getting back together. It can be problematic if you are the band that tours as the Dead Kennedys, of course. There’s a whole saga there that I won’t go into, but if Jello Biafra’s not involved, and in fact is actively against it, then it’s not the Dead Kennedys.</p>
<p>Indeed, in his song “Buy My Snake Oil” Jello suggested that a way for old punks to make money off their history would be to</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Give in<br>
  Ride the punk nostalgia wave<br>
  For all it’s worth<br>
  Recycle the name of my old band<br>
  For a big reunion tour<br>
  Sing all those hits from the “good ol’ days”<br>
  ‘Bout how bad the good ol’ days were
</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is a fair criticism of old bands doing their thing in modern days, I guess. But I see two arguments to counter it, from a gig-goer’s point of view.</p>
<h2 id="unfinished">Unfinished</h2>
<p>The first was made by my friend <a href="http://www.writers-bloc.org.uk/comrades/andrew-j-wilson/">Andrew</a>, around the time that the Sex Pistols reformed and toured. This would have been in 1996.</p>
<p>“I missed them first time round,” he said when I challenged him about it. “This is unfinished business for me.”</p>
<p>Which was a good point, and kind of made me regret playing the purist and not going.</p>
<p>In 1993 I had investigated going to see the reunited Velvet Underground. But I really didn’t want to see them at an all-seated venue.  Partly because I’d had a bad experience seeing Lou Reed a year or so before (despite having had a very <em>good</em> experience with him a year or two before that).</p>
<p>I recall that I phoned the venue — Earl’s Court, I think — and found that it did have some standing room. But those tickets were sold out. So I didn’t go. Regretted that, too. So I’m taking the chance to see bands like the Rezillos, or The Beat and The Selecter, that I missed first time around.</p>
<h2 id="ok-but-what-is-it-really">OK, But What is it Really?</h2>
<p>The second point about the “punk nostalgia wave” (or any similar accusation of nostalgia) is: that is not what it is.</p>
<p>Because here’s the thing: it isn’t nostalgia if you’re carrying on with something that was always there.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Nostalgia (noun):  a feeling of pleasure and also slight sadness when you think about things that happened in the past
</p></blockquote>
<a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nostalgia">according to Cambridge</a>.
<p>But this isn’t that. Because while those bands’ heydays might have been in the past, their music has remained available and frequently-played. You can’t be nostalgic for an album you listened to last week, or last night.</p>
<p>And a live performance always happens in the present.</p>
<p>This train of thought was kicked off for me a couple of years back when there was an article in the <cite>Guardian</cite>, prior to <cite>The Force Awakens</cite> coming out. I can’t find it now,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> but it claimed that “nostalgia” was part of the cause of the excitement for the new film.</p>
<p>And I thought, no. Well, maybe for some people. But for many of us, if not most of us, <cite>Star Wars</cite> never went away. We’ve watched it,  talked about it, read theories about it, and so on. It has been part of our lives.</p>
<p>Or take <cite>Doctor Who</cite>. Sure, there were the wilderness years before 2005, but The Doctor never really went away. The Tardis and Daleks are burned into Britain’s cultural memory, and I think they always will be.</p>
<p>Now if I were to see an episode of, say, <cite>Marine Boy</cite>: <em>that</em> would be nostalgic. I remember it fondly from my childhood, and have never seen it since. I’ve never even seen it in colour, because those were the days of black &amp; white televisions.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>But I can’t be nostalgic for punk bands or <cite>Star Wars</cite> or <cite>Doctor Who</cite>, because they <em>never went away</em>. The sense of warmth and shared experience they bring: that’s not nostalgia, it’s something else. Familiarity, at worst. Or better: <em>community</em>.</p>

			 <p>I hadn’t come across <a href="http://garagelandlondon.com">Garageland London</a> before, though I approve of the name.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> They came across my radar the other day with a piece called <a href="http://garagelandlondon.com/desist.htm">Cease and Desist: An open letter to Brewdog from PUNK</a>, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has recently been brought to our attention that you are claiming legal ownership of the word ‘punk’ and are sending threatening legal notices to those you feel are infringing on that ownership by using that word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hadn’t heard this about Brewdog. If it’s true, they’re being beyond ridiculous (or possibly winding people up). I’ve got a lot of time for a Scottish company making craft beer, even if it’s only OK (and too damn strong most of the time: I like a beer you can drink a few of without falling over). But like the Garageland people, I thought their “Equity for Punks investment portfolio did raise some eyebrows.”</p>
<p>The open letter ends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definitions of punk are varied and debates over those definitions have been going on since before you were born. However, one thing punk is not is a bully! That goes against everything punk stands for. If you continue in this vein your punk credentials will be revoked and you will be called upon to cease and desist.</p>
<p>Kind regards and a middle finger salute</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and is then signed by hundreds of bands. So many that I can’t really believe the website got agreement from all of them. But I heartily endorse the message.</p>
<p>In other good news, the <a href="http://www.tor.com/2017/04/04/2017-hugo-award-finalists-announced/">Hugo Awards nominations were announced</a>, and it looks like a great list, and also like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Puppies">Puppies</a> have been almost totally wiped out this year. Yay fandom!</p>
<p>I also note that one of the novel nominees is the very <cite>Too Like the Lightning</cite> that I was <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/26/publishers-and-sinners/">writing about</a> the other day. Hugo nominated, and you still can’t buy it in Britain. Come <em>on</em> publishers!</p>
<p>Also: WordPress tells me that this is my 600th post on here. Not that many for the time the site’s been going for, but a milestone — or at least a round number — nonetheless.</p>

			 <p>No, that’s nothing to do with hamburgers. Apple today <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives">announced</a> that they’re working on a redesign of the Mac Pro.

			 <p>Spent most of today in the garden, making a start on clearing it up for the summer. Not exactly gardening, as such. More gathering sticks and leaves, and putting them into brown bins for collection. Nice day for it, though.</p>
<p>Then this evening to the <a href="http://barbican.org.uk">Barbican</a>, for the New York Philharmonic doing a couple of pieces by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_(composer)">John Adams</a>, as part of the “John Adams at 70″ series. Oh, and in the middle they had a cello concerto by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esa-Pekka_Salonen">Esa-Pekka Salonen</a>. Who was the cellist? Nobody special. Just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-Yo_Ma">Yo-Yo Ma</a>.</p>
<p>It was clearly a virtuoso performance, but I didn’t enjoy the Salonen nearly as much as I did the two Adams pieces. Especially the second, “Harmonielehre.” Among other things, it’s good to see something orchestral where the percussionists have some serious work to do.</p>
<p>Not that we could see the percussionists, mostly. We were effectively in the front row. Which is to say, it was row D, but row C was right up against the front of the stage, and not being used because the stage had been extended into rows A and B. That orchestra is <em>big</em>. The downside of having such close seats is that you can only see the first few rows of the orchestra: the string sections, basically.</p>
<p>The big upside of the position, of course, is that you get such a close view and intimate sense of the performance. It’s almost like you’re inside the music at times.</p>
<p>Meanwhile British politics has gone even crazier, with Michael Howard crawling out of the woodwork to <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/04/02/theresa-may-would-go-to-war-to-defend-gibraltar-6548907/">threaten war with Spain</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But that’s a discussion for another time.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>To be fair to Howard, that’s not at all what he said. Just that May should be as steadfast with Spain as Thatcher was with Argentina. But “war” is of course how the papers are hyping it. It wouldn’t surprise me if Gibraltarians (96% remain) now wanted to become part of Spain.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <html><body><p>As well as being in charge of the website of the <a href="http://www.bsfa.co.uk">British Science Fiction Association</a> (BSFA), I also admin the association’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BritishScienceFictionAssociation/">Facebook group</a>. Yesterday a member posted a link to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39444025?SThisFB">BBC story about the sexuality</a> of the new companion in <cite>Doctor Who</cite>. “Doctor Who gets first openly gay companion,” it says. Nice to know, but no big deal in 2017, right?</p>
<p>Wrong, sadly. I woke to 81 comments on the FB post. That’s a huge number by the normal standards of the group. It’s not very chatty. It turned out that a raving homophobe had stormed into the group and started to shout about the corruption of youth and I don’t know what all. The comments were a combination of his, and of calmer and more tolerant heads both calling him out and trying to debate rationally with him. To no avail.</p>
<p>I had no choice — nor any desire — but to kick him out the group and block him. I wrote <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BritishScienceFictionAssociation/permalink/10154445193132045/">the following</a>, and I thought I should preserve it here;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’ve just had to eject a member from the group for making offensive remarks to other members. And worse, making remarks offensive to other members.</p>
<p>  Specifically he was being offensive to all our LGBT members, and everyone who supports them, or who just supports humanity and common decency.<br>
  Oh, wait, that’s <strong>all</strong> the other members, isn’t it?</p>
<p>  Folks, I don’t need to tell you this, but it’s 2017. You can no longer argue that characters in popular TV programmes should not reflect the whole range of people in society. Nor can you make the argument that a character’s sexuality should have no place in <cite>Doctor Who</cite>, when it plainly has had a place at least since 2005.</p>
<p>  Or don’t these people remember Rose being in love with The Doctor? Martha pining over him? Hell, go back further: Jo went off and married a male ecologist. And I’m sure at least a couple of other female companions went off with guys.</p>
<p>  <strong>Flaunting</strong> their heterosexuality.</p>
<p>  We won’t get any of that with Bill, at least.</p>
<p>  Unless the next Doctor is a woman.

			 <html><body><p>There’s a new podcast out from the makers of <cite>Serial</cite>. Seems like it’s going to be very interesting.</p>
<p>It’s called <cite><a href="https://stownpodcast.org">S-Town</a></cite>, which stands for “shit town,” but I guess they don’t want to put a swear in the title. They don’t bleep anything out in the show, though.</p>
<p>It’s about a guy from rural Alabama who contacts reporter Brian Reed to tell him about the corruption in his town. Supposedly the Sheriff’s department is so corrupt that a few years ago a son of a rich family murdered someone, and it was so thoroughly covered up that there’s no trace of it. That’s what John says, anyway.</p>
<p>Eventually Reed starts to look into it, and the story begins. I’m only an episode and a half in and it’s pretty compelling so far. There are seven episodes in total, and, Netflix-style, they’re all available now. Well worth a listen, I’d say.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I couldn’t let this night pass without acknowledging that tomorrow will be the start of us losing something great. In years to come the names of Cameron, May, Farage, Gove, etc, will be reviled, of course, but that doesn’t help us now. It doesn’t help us prevent the slide into the abyss of small-minded, inward-looking ugliness that I fear we are headed for.</p>
<p>I don’t want to see these islands turning into the nightmare archipelago that they could if we let the insane clowns in government lead us into a cesspit of deregulation, rejection of human rights, and economic disaster.</p>
<p>I reject all that. I choose optimism.</p>
<p>I choose to believe that most people are basically decent and want the best for everyone, even if a small minority of them made a bad choice in voting, guided by liars.</p>
<p>I choose to believe that there is such a thing as progress in society, in culture. It isn’t constant and it isn’t guaranteed, but its <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/111013-the-arc-of-the-moral-universe-is-long-but-it">arc does bend towards justice</a>.</p>
<p>I choose to believe that the forces of backwardness — the racists, the misogynists, the homophobes, and everyone who condemns their fellow humans for what they are, what they believe, how they live or who they love — that those people will be washed up by the tides of history, left flapping on the shores of the future, and waste away.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will still be in the European Union, but no longer of it. Brexit can still be stopped, but if it isn’t, if it goes ahead at full crashing speed the way the Tories seem to want: I choose to believe that we can still be the open-minded, welcoming society that I know we are.</p>
<p>And one day, Europe, we’ll come back.</p>

			 <p>I was thinking about the loss of singles. Not individual tracks released individually: that still happens, of course; perhaps more than ever. But back in the days of actual, physical singles — 45 rpm records, or even CD singles later — you didn’t just get an individual track.</p>
<p>I’m here to celebrate — and maybe mourn the loss of — the B-side.</p>
<p>When you bought a single you usually knew what the main song was going to be, because you had heard it on the radio, or at least read a review. Or you might just know and trust the artist’s work, and believe that the chosen track would be worth your 75p.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But there was always the promise that there would be something good on the other side, too.</p>
<p>Often, of course, the B-side track was really “B” quality, or lower. It was genuinely just filler. Which was always a shame. I remember flipping Elvis Costello’s “Oliver’s Army,” to find out what “My Funny Valentine” was like. I hated it, and never listened to it again. Though as (in other versions) it’s something of a jazz classic, it’s possible that I’d like it more now.</p>
<p>The Members’ classic “The Sound of the Suburbs” was backed by something called “Handling the Big Jets,” which always sounded slightly rude to us<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and I think was an instrumental.</p>
<p>But for every one of those you could get a “Jail Guitar Doors,”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> or a “The Prisoner.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Or almost any Beatles single.</p>
<p>Then there were double A-sides, wherein both sides were supposed to be worthy of being playlisted. They always felt like slightly better value for your hard-earned pocket money.</p>
<p>And when CD singles came along they usually had three tracks, raising them arguably into the EP category.</p>
<p>But now, tracks are realised for streaming or download, completely on their own. It’s very sad, and I’m sure they must feel lonely. Plus if you’re buying the download and you want what would have been the B-side, you have to pay for each individual track.</p>
<p>I was going to say, as well, that if you search for single on your streaming service of choice, you only get one track. But I found out the other day that’s not quite true. I wanted to listen to “Elephant Stone,” by the Stone Roses; and in fact the B-side, “The Hardest Thing In the World” <em>was</em> listed too. Its “Album” tag was given as “Elephant Stone — Single (2009)”.</p>
<p>Which apart from the wrong date (and ok, it could’ve been a reissue <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>) is not a bad example of misused metadata. Or maybe just misnamed: not every gathering or carrier of a group of songs or musical pieces is an “album”.</p>
<p>Or maybe that’s just a change of meaning: what we used to call a single or an EP is now just a very short album.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Borrowing that title from (what used to be) a regular section in Dave Langford’s <cite><a href="http://news.ansible.uk">Ansible</a></cite> newsletter.</p>
<p>The publishing sin in question, though, is quite astonishingly egregious, if the story is true. And I have no reason to doubt it.</p>
<p>There’s a book called <cite><a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/too-like-the-lightning-ada-palmer/1122537906?ean=9780765378002">Too Like the Lightning</a></cite>, by Ada Palmer. I read a review of it a year or so back and thought it sounded really interesting. But I didn’t get round to trying to get it at the time.</p>
<p>Something reminded me of it recently, and I tracked it down, at least to the publisher’s site that I linked to there. But I wanted to buy a copy on Kindle, and Amazon had no sign of it. This is relatively rare nowadays. Especially in SF, surely.</p>
<p>I tried again a couple of times, but to no avail. There are a few chapters available on the Tor website; and they were one of the first major publishers to really push ebooks without DRM, so you’d expect something there, but no.</p>
<p>I think you can get a Nook copy at the site above, but Nook? I mean, come on.</p>
<p>Anyway, eventually I duckducked in the modern style, which is to say I just typed the question: “why is ‘too like the lightning’ not available on kindle”.</p>
<p>I was led to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5wwmo9/ada_palmer_ama_author_of_too_like_the_lightning/?st=j0pneb2r&amp;sh=d911c934">Reddit AMA with the author</a>, wherein she said this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  That [making the book available on the UK Kindle store] can only happen if a UK publisher decides to publish it. Unfortunately <strong>UK publishers rarely publish female SF authors; a lot of them feel strongly that only male SF authors are likely to sell</strong>. If you want it to come out in the UK Kindle store, the best option is to write a quick e-mail to a couple of your favorite UK SP publishers to tell them you’re eager for these books — hearing from readers makes a big difference when publishers are considering picking up an author for localization.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine. If this is true — and again, I have no reason to doubt her word — I am beyond horrified that such an attitude can be prevalent at UK publishers. In 2017.</p>
<p>Obviously what I want to do now is to buy a physical copy, here in the UK. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Lightning-Terra-Ignota-Assistant-Professor-History-Palmer/0765378019/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490566148&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=too+like+the+lightning">It’s listed on Amazon UK</a>, but it’s not clear whether it’s an import from the US, or what. (Also very strange is the author’s credit in that entry: “Assistant Professor of History Ada Palmer.” It even makes it into the URL.)</p>
<p>As well as blatant sexism, this is an example of the ridiculous regionalism that publishers still try to force onto the internet age. Also film and TV companies. Luckily Apple stopped the music business doing that.</p>
<p>Bits don’t see borders. And neither should we. But that’s very much another conversation.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what I’m going to do? I’m going to see if I can order it from <a href="http://pagesofhackney.co.uk">my local bookshop</a>. Support your local, as well as fight sexism in a small way.</p>

Obviously that was intended, generally; but specifically it had resonance with London’s reaction to the Westminster terrorist attack.</p>
<p>Also about that, Mitch Benn has written a song called “<a href="https://youtu.be/2yhzy4bMx0E">London’s Had Worse</a>,” in which he sings of our resilience and the attacker’s crapness. Not his best song, but no bad.</p>

			 <p>Podcast adverts are the least offensive of all types of advertising. Because even though they’re in your ears, they’re not in your face.</p>
<p>I’m talking, here, about the sponsorship kind, wherein the podcast host reads some ad copy in their own voice. Sometimes copy supplied by the company, sometimes their own words. Sometimes they just read plainly, sometimes it’s <a href="https://www.relay.fm/rocket">more entertaining</a>.</p>
<p>But it’s always relevant and <em>vetted</em>. I’m more likely to look at the product or service mentioned in a podcast that I listen to regularly than any that’s advertised on a website. Especially if the website uses a popup.</p>
<p>And if you don’t want to listen to the sponsor’s message, podcast players make it very easy to skip forward.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>One organisation that has been sponsoring a lot lately is <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com">Away Travel</a>. They make a range of modern, four-wheel, hardshell suitcases. Their carry-on versions have the innovation of including a battery and a couple of USB ports, so you can charge your phone, iPad, etc, while you’re at the airport.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>They seem like they make a pretty good product. But the strange thing is that the podcast hosts all stress how inexpensive the cases are. But they’re not. The biggest one is nearly £300. <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/samsonite-s'cure-4-wheel-75cm-large-suitcase-pacific-blue/p1125650">John Lewis sells a similar Samsonite model</a> for £179, for example.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the Away one is tougher, of course. Impossible to tell without seeing them side by side. But I don’t think Away should be trying to sell themselves on cheapness when they’re significantly more expensive than a high-end brand. Embrace the expense; go for the luxury market. Or something.</p>
<p>It works for Apple.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Today’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/22/how-the-new-electronics-ban-serves-the-trump-agenda/?utm_term=.0ee6e06efb73">Washington Post WorldView</a> newsletter throws more light, a lot of shade, and a lot more confusion onto the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/21/stupid-fawning-lapdog-government-apes-the-us-again/">ban I linked to last night</a>, on taking laptops and tablets in hand luggage from certain airports.</p>
<p>First, I didn’t realise that the list of affected airports is different between the UK and the US. Second, for the US, it is just a small set of airports, not all airports in the affected countries. The UK takes the broader approach — but for a different set of countries.</p>
<p>The most interesting point to my mind is that this may all be Trump trying to help American businesses:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/us-unveils-new-restrictions-on-travelers-from-eight-muslim-majority-countries/2017/03/21/d4efd080-0dcb-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html?utm_term=.f8fd93ddc28d">pressed by reporters</a>, officials in both countries said the measures were not a response to a specific threat, but rather the result of intelligence assessments that concluded groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda are seeking new methods to sow terror in the skies, possibly through hidden bombs in electronic equipment.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And later:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Farrell and Newman suggested Tuesday’s order is an example of the Trump administration “weaponizing interdependence” — using its leverage in a world where American airports are key “nodes” in global air travel to weaken competitors. My colleague Max Bearak <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/21/what-is-the-logic-behind-trumps-new-electronics-ban-people-are-stumped/?utm_term=.41d88b6c74d5">detailed how this could be a part of Trump’s wider protectionist agenda</a>. In February, President Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-08/u-s-airline-chiefs-set-to-talk-jobs-traffic-control-with-trump">met with executives of U.S. airlines</a> and pledged that he would help them compete against foreign carriers that receive subsidies from their home governments.</p>
<p>  “A lot of that competition is subsidized by governments, big league,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/21/what-is-the-logic-behind-trumps-new-electronics-ban-people-are-stumped/?utm_term=.41d88b6c74d5">said</a> Trump at that meeting. “I’ve heard that complaint from different people in this room. Probably about one hour after I got elected, I was inundated with calls from your industry and many other industries, because it’s a very unfair situation.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>So unfair. But if that’s what’s behind it, what the hell does our glorious leader get out of going along with a slightly modified version of it? It’s certainly not to protect British airlines, as they (unlike American airlines) are affected by the ban. Maybe my “lapdog” dig was exactly right. For years Tony Blair was referred too as George W Bush’s poodle. Maybe Theresa May is adopting the same role for Trump. Which is a horrifying thought.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/us-unveils-new-restrictions-on-travelers-from-eight-muslim-majority-countries/2017/03/21/d4efd080-0dcb-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html?utm_term=.0c6ec86f35ee&amp;wpisrc=nl_todayworld&amp;wpmm=1">Another WaPo article</a> contradicts all that, though, suggesting that the whole thing might be based on some credible concerns:</p>
<blockquote>
  The U.S. restrictions were prompted by a growing concern within the government that terrorists who have long sought to develop hard-to-detect bombs hidden inside electronic devices may have put renewed effort into that work, according to people familiar with the matter
</blockquote>
<p>But it asks the question and fails to get a satisfactory answer, “Why not ban all electronics on flights, then?”</p>
<blockquote>
  People familiar with the discussions said the restrictions were designed to defeat the particular type of threat that is of greatest concern: the possibility that terrorists could smuggle explosives inside electronics and manually detonate them once on a plane.
</blockquote>
<p>Even if that makes sense (after all, its not like a computer in the hold is (or could hide) some kind of timing device): why just from a strange subset of airports, even in the countries of concern?</p>
<p>And if it’s all based on a real threat, why the US/UK difference?</p>
<p>They also raise the real concern that journalists, activists, and just ordinary citizens, will be separated from their personal information, leaving it under the control of unknown people.</p>
<p>Buckle up, folks, this ride is only going to get stranger and more unpleasant.</p>

			 <html><body><p>You’re probably wondering what’s happened to my books posts. Surely I must have read something since <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/03/the-secret-of-twin-peaks-by-mark-frost-books-2017-1/">January</a> (and I thought I’d posted about two books this year, but apparently not).</p>
<p>Thing is, after the <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> book, I started something rather large. I’m over 200 pages in, which means I’m about one-sixth of the way through it.</p>
<p>It is Alan Moore’s <cite>Jerusalem</cite>: a monster hardback with tiny print. I picked it up when I went to see him interviewed by Stewart Lee, back in November. I could have got either the hardback or a slipcased three-volume paperback version. Almost as soon as I started reading I wished I’d gone for the latter, because it’s <em>so damn heavy</em> to hold.</p>
<p>So it’ll take me quite a while till I’m ready to write about it. I’m thoroughly enjoying it, though.</p>

<p>It’s called “The Model,” which makes it hard to search for, being so generic. But it’s clear to me that the hair &amp; makeup people of the original <cite>Star Wars</cite> must have been familiar with it, since it is totally where they got Princess Leia’s headphone hairstyle.</p>
<p>Bell lived until 1961, so her work is still in copyright, which I expect is why it’s hard to find a decent image online, but <a href="https://goo.gl/images/aGpwj0">Google Image Search has this</a>.</p>

			 <p>Back in January I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/05/things-that-should-be-easy/">wrote about trying to play podcasts through the Sonos</a>. As you’ll recall<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I had tried and failed to install AirSonos on my NAS, and was considering trying <a href="http://sonoair.mihosoft.eu">SonoAir</a> on my Mac.</p>
<p>I did try it, but it never quite worked. The app launched, and found the Sonos network and the speaker. But it didn’t appear as an AirPlay device to my phone. I could make it work in one context: iTunes (on the same Mac) could see it and use it as a functional output device.But that wasn’t much use, as the Sonos already has access to my iTunes library from where it’s backed up on the NAS — and also to Apple Music. So being able to play from iTunes to the Sonos brought nothing new.</p>
<p>The added functionality I was looking for was to be able to play podcasts from Overcast, and switch to the speaker when I’m listening in the kitchen. For that my iPhone or iPad needs to be able to see the speaker.</p>
<p>So it all didn’t look too promising. But I was just having another go, and I noticed that the version on the website is 1.0 (BETA 6.1), while I had BETA 4. A quick download and we’re up and running: it works!</p>
<p>Now I just have to keep my MacBook running at all times. Oh well.</p>

			 <p>Well, yesterday genuinely feels like the first day I’ve missed posting this year. A few post-midnight posts have counted towards the previous day, but although I’m writing this early in the morning, it’s definitely the 16th.</p>
<p>It’s for a good reason, though: I went to the pub after work.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The occasion was the monthly drinks for ex- and still-current-Misys people. Always good to see folk I haven’t seen for a while. And <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/vista-buy-dh-corp-2-123033999.html">Misys are in the news at the moment</a>. It looks like my old section, Payments &amp; Messaging, won’t be long for this world (even what little is left of it). This <a href="http://www.dh.com">D+H</a> outfit — Vista, the owners of Misys, have bought them and are planning to smoosh them together with Misys — is big in payments. I’d expect that their products will be seen as superior, and our Payment Manager will start to be sunsetted.</p>
<p>That’s certainly the likely trajectory if Misys management end up running the combined organisation. They have a permanent, severe case of inverse not-invented-here syndrome. Any product that the company has been making and selling successfully for years (decades, in the case of Midas and Equation) is automatically suspect and needs to be edged out in favour of something that came from another company, and/or is newer and less capable.</p>
<p>Mind you, those old products have a habit of keeping on keeping on (and making the company money). Because, of course, they meet the needs of customers.</p>
<p>Not that anyone was talking about that at the pub.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Couple of thoughts about the news, tonight. First of all, CNN <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/13/politics/sean-spicer-donald-trump-wiretapping/index.html?utm_campaign=digest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=app">reports</a> on Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s “counselor,” and her strange thoughts about microwaves:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other,” Conway said, before suggesting that surveillance could take place through phones, TVs or “microwaves that turn into cameras.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I want one of these magic microwaves. I mean, think about it: you can reheat your leftovers, then take a photograph of them and post it to Instagram. All from the same device.</p>
<p>More sanely (at least slightly) they seem to be backing off from the nonsensical wiretapping accusations. According to Sean Spicer, the Whitehouse press secretary:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The President used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities”
</p></blockquote>
<p>So that’s OK, then.</p>
<p>In <a href="edition.cnn.com/2017/03/05/opinions/trump-tweets-fun-over-obeidallah-opinion/index.html?iid=ob_lockedrail_bottomlist">another article</a> they treat it all more seriously, pointing out that doing down your predecessors is a tactic of dictators everywhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  They, too, use the apparatus of government to support their whims. And worse, they also seek to punish their predecessors in office and political opponents — as we have seen in countries from Iran to Zambia to, of course, Russia.
</p>
<p>  How long until we hear Trump surrogates suggest that Obama might be guilty of a crime?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Closer to home, the UK government’s Mayhem programme involved them <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39262081?utm_campaign=digest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=app">forcing through the Brexit bill</a>, so we’re teetering along the slippery slope, getting ready to run towards the cliff of deadly metaphors.</p>
<p>Jeremy Corbyn has things in hand, though. He tweeted:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deeply disappointing that govt denied the people, through Parliament, Brexit oversight &amp; refused to guarantee the rights of EU nationals</p>
<p>— Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/841389075710017537">March 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We will continue to demand that the stress they, and Brits in the EU, are being put under is ended, and they are given the right to remain</p>
<p>— Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/841389122874933248">March 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Labour at every stage will challenge govt plans for a bargain basement Brexit with our alternative that puts jobs &amp; living standards first</p>
<p>— Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/841389197005053953">March 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This is the same Jeremy Corbyn who, just a few weeks ago, put a three-line whip in place to make his MPs vote in favour of the initial version of the bill — which is identical to the version that has now been passed, since the Lords’ amendments were all rolled back.</p>
<p>I voted for him as leader, twice, but I regret it now, I’ve got to say. He’s a decent guy, and I agree with him on many — even most — issues. But on this, the most important thing facing our country today, leading to potentially the biggest disaster since the Second World War, he’s been completely useless. Worse: complicit.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I hope everyone’s following the new series of <cite>Broadchurch</cite>. If you thought the second season didn’t live up to the first, then I think you’ll find that the third brings it back to greatness. Trilogies always sag in the middle, don’t they?</p>
<p>People are being <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/broadchurch?src=tren&amp;data_id=tweet%3A841399239401971715">very positive about it on Twitter</a>. Many of the comments are around how every guy you see is a possible suspect. Which is very true. I’m just glad to discover that there are <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2249364/episodes?season=3&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_3">eight episodes</a>, not six as I had thought. Which means we’re still not quite halfway through.</p>
<p>David Tennant and Olivia Coleman are fantastic together as ever. and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2092886/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Jodie Whittaker</a> as Beth is amazing.</p>
<p>Most of all, I think it bodes well for Chris Chibnall’s future role as head writer on <cite>Doctor Who</cite>.</p>

			 <html><body><p>One of the blogs I follow is called <cite><a href="http://leancrew.com/all-this/">And now it’s all this</a></cite>, by the mysterious Dr Drang. He writes mainly on engineering and provides lots of interesting Python scripts.</p>
<p>What I’m interested in his blog’s title and subtitle, though. “And now it’s all this”; and “I just said what I said and it was wrong. Or was taken wrong.” I’ve been reading it for years, and had only idly wondered about why it was called that, or what it really meant.</p>
<p>I’ve also been listening to, and reading about, The Beatles for years — for a great many more years. And so I was very familiar with John Lennon’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_popular_than_Jesus">more popular than Jesus</a>” line, and the subsequent furore.</p>
<p>But not <em>that</em> familiar, it turns out. Or not with his apology, at least.</p>
<p>We recently watched the excellent <cite>Eight Days a Week</cite> film, which has lots of Beatles footage I’d never seen before, and puts it all together into a compelling narrative.</p>
<p>Of course, it covers the “Jesus” period. So there was John, at a press conference, making an apology of sorts. And out pops:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I just said what I said and it was wrong. Or was taken wrong. And now it’s all this.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh. OK. Right. I should have seen that years ago.</p>
<p>Of course there are two remaining questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Why</em> did the good doctor choose to name his blog that?</li>
<li>And what does the “leancrew” mean in his domain name?</li>
</ol>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/02/07/international-clash-day/">International Clash Day</a> I mentioned a life-changing song: “Wasted Life,” by Stiff Little Fingers. SLF’s anti-military song literally changed my life; or its potential direction, at least. I was probably moving in an anti-war kind of direction anyway, to be fair, but it was definitely a trigger point.</p>
<p>People say — or used they to, at least — that a song couldn’t change your life. By comparison, I don’t think there was ever a similar tendency to say that a book couldn’t change a person’s life. I suspect that is down to their comparative sizes: it seems respectable for something the size of a novel to have a major impact on a human’s psyche, while a three-minute song? Not so much.</p>
<p>Although if it were merely length, then people wouldn’t have complained if you said an album changed your life. I’m not sure that anyone ever said that,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but I suspect that if they had, their statement would have been pooh-poohed just as much as the same claim for a song.</p>
<p>At this point I feel I ought to quote Springsteen, giving the opposite view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We learned more from a three-minute record, baby,<br />
Than we ever learned in school</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he sings in “No Surrender.” Hyperbole, certainly, but there is a core of truth to it: the truth of the <em>feeling</em> you can get from listening to a great song.</p>
<p>With “Wasted Life” the feeling for me was of sudden crystallisation, or realisation.  I had, for some years, been saying that I wanted to be  pilot, join the RAF. This was before the horrors of the Gulf War, or for that matter the Balkans. Though it was in the heart of the Cold War, and British soldiers were stationed in Northern Ireland during the troubles — though not so much RAF staff, I would think.</p>
<p>But I was blind to all that, brought up as I was on a diet of Second World War films, <cite>Commando</cite> comics, and Airfix models of warplanes. I had, in short, a thoroughly romanticised view of war. And I just wanted to fly.</p>
<p>But I didn’t want to kill. I  had always known that, I’m sure. But <em>two lines</em> of that one song made it real for me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stuff their fucking armies<br />
Killing isn’t  my idea of fun<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that was all it took. I remember that it was a while before I could tell my parents that I had changed my plans. Perhaps because they would have asked why, and I didn’t want to have to explain it. Maybe because I thought they’d be disappointed. I’m sure my Mum wasn’t. My Dad kind of was: “But you were going to be a Spanish-speaking pilot,” he said. He had always been slightly amused that my school taught half of us Spanish, instead of the then-much-more-conventional French.</p>
<p>A life can hinge on such a small moment.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>I’ve just had two slightly odd experiences while researching Stiff Little Fingers.</p>
<p>SLF were the first band I ever saw live, and they had a major effect on my life — which is why I was researching them: I’m writing a longer piece about the effect they had on me.</p>
<p>So as I was reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_Little_Fingers">Wikipedia article</a> about them, I became somewhat confused. Because it says they split up in 1983, and reformed in 1987. Now the breakup I’d forgotten about, but it seems right. However, I saw them on the tour in 87. I saw them two days in a row. I had tickets for the Brixton Academy gig, which I think was on a Saturday, and then when <cite>Time Out</cite> came out that week there was a small advert in the back (I’ve no idea how I came to see it), which said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Tin Soldiers</strong><br>
  Belfast’s finest. Shhh: a secret gig!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Or something very like that. It was on the Friday night at the Mean Fiddler. Which I don’t think I had ever been to at that time, and which was a bastard long way from Tooting. But I wasn’t going to miss the chance to see SLF in a small club.</p>
<p>What I mainly remember was that the Academy gig the next night was a bit of a letdown after the intensity of seeing them at the Mean Fiddler.</p>
<p>But anyway, the point of all of this is that as far as I remember things, this all was — or was billed as — their farewell tour. That’s why the t-shirt (which I still have) says “Game Over.”</p>
<p>Now obviously they’re around again, and I’ve seen them since, and bought albums they’ve released since. But my memory says they broke up in 87 (or it could have been 88, but I think not (though actually March 88 if <a href="http://www.setlist.fm/setlists/stiff-little-fingers-7bd6b20c.html?page=32">this setlist site</a> is to be believed)), and then reformed later. But Wikipedia and <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/stiff-little-fingers-mn0000937098/biography">All Music</a> both say I’m wrong.</p>
<p>I don’t know. Who would <em>you</em> trust?</p>
<p>Actually probably not me. I’m becoming more convinced as I look at that setlist site, that I must have seen them several times at the Academy, after moving to London in 87, and the supposed farewell tour must have been later. In which case the Mean Fiddler was a bastard long way from Walthamstow, but that’s still true.</p>
<p>The second odd experience was that I clicked onto the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stiff_Little_Fingers">Wikipedia talk page</a> to see whether the history was disputed at all. It isn’t, but around five sections in there’s a section entitled “the?”, in which someone asks whether they were ever referred to as “the Stiff Little Fingers.”</p>
<p>And back in 2007 some guy called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Devilgate">Devilgate</a>” answered firmly in the negative.</p>

<p>We only started watching it a few weeks ago. Luckily the whole thing is <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/catastrophe">available on All 4</a>. Thank the tech &amp; TV industries for catchup services.</p>
<p>Channel 4′s even seems to have become stable, and improved its UI. It’s only about a year ago that we stopped watching <cite>Homeland</cite> because the playback was so choppy. And we couldn’t record it because it was on Sunday night at the same time as <cite>Downton Abbey</cite>, and we were recording that. (We only have a simple DVR.)</p>

			 <p>Many songs these days involve one or more other artists guesting with the main one. Rappers adding a part to a singer’s track, for example. Nowadays such guests are always credited. Quite rightly: we’ve come a long way from the days when Billy Preston played keyboards on some Beatles songs uncredited (though visible in the famous Apple Records rooftop performance).</p>
<p>As featured artists, such guests are nearly always credited using the abbreviation “feat.” “The Beatles feat Billy Preston,” to give an example that was never used.</p>
<p>But “feat” is a word on it’s own, of course, as well as an abbreviation. Which I think may be why I always find the formation slightly amusing. And there used to be a band called Little Feat, if I’m not very much mistaken (I’ve never knowingly heard them).</p>
<p>So I’ve been wondering how the modern crediting style would have worked if they had ever been guests, or had featured guests, on any of their songs. “Little Feat feat Joe Feet.” “Legs &amp; Co feat Little Feat.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Alas, it was not the way back then. Though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Feat">their Wikipedia article</a> suggests they’re still around, so it could happen.</p>
<p>More surprisingly it tells us that they changed “Feet” to “Feat” as a “homage to the Beatles.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I had no inkling of that connection when I mentioned the Beatles above.</p>

			 <p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/04/what-writers-really-do-when-they-write">What Writers Really Do When They Write</a> George Saunders gives a great insight into some parts of his working process.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I should start a new category here, for word-use. In fact, having written that, I just have: <a href="/categories/language">language</a> (hopefully that link will work once I publish this).</p>
<p>Today I want to talk about the word “pivot.” As you know, pivot has come, over the last few years, to mean change direction, especially in a political context. A recent example from the <cite>New Yorker</cite>: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dont-be-fooled-donald-trump-didnt-pivot">Don’t Be Fooled. Donald Trump Didn’t Pivot</a>.</p>
<p>It sort of makes sense, but like many knew usages, I can’t help but wonder <em>why</em> it has come into this use.</p>
<p>And for this one I also can’t help but wonder to what extent <cite>Friends</cite> is responsible.</p>
<p>You’ll know the episode I’m thinking of, if you’ve seen it: Ross is moving in to a new apartment, and being too cheap to pay the delivery charge, ropes Rachel in to help him move a sofa. Inevitably they get stuck on the stairs, and he keeps shouting at her, “Pivot! Pivot!” to try to get her to turn the sofa in an unspecified direction.</p>
<p>Of course, he might have been using it quite precisely: the sofa probably needed to rotate about a fixed point, which is what “pivot” originally meant.</p>
<p>What it has come to mean, in politics, is a change of direction less than a U-turn (or flip-flop); but still quite a substantial one. I suppose it has a sense of turning without moving forward at the same time. Though I may be overthinking it there. It’s quite descriptive, but it seems like it has becoming ubiquitous incredibly quickly; and is already practically a cliche.</p>
<p>Of course that’s just my view of the <a href="/blog/2017/02/08/optics/">optics</a> of the thing.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Having looked again over <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/01/under-the-television-skies/">yesterday’s piece</a>, I’ve had a slight change of heart.</p>
<p>As I’m sure you noticed, I made a comment in the footnote to the effect that I thought that my misremembering of <cite>Neuromancer</cite>‘s famous opening line was better than the actual one. I no longer think that’s the case.</p>
<p>Gibson obviously knew what he was doing. “The sky above the port” is more euphonious than my “over the port.”</p>
<p>Glad we got that sorted out.</p>

			 <p>In <a href="https://jackdeighton.co.uk/2017/02/23/the-colour-of-television/">The Colour of Television</a> Jack Deighton questions the worth of the famous opening line of William Gibson’s <cite>Neuromancer</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sky above the port was the colour of television, tuned to a dead channel.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jack questions its meaning, and describes it as “an author, straining, unsuccessfully, for effect.” I commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[D]on’t take it so literally. It was obviously meant to mean “the screen of a television set,” but writing’s all about deleting unnecessary words, as Orwell told us.</p>
<p>I always took it to mean a stormy grey sky. Not literally speckled like an old telly on a channel where there was only static, but that was certainly what he was going for. Imagine that roiling, churning, grey-black-white melange, converted into a sky of a similar colour palette.</p>
<p>It’s so evocative, so memorable, it’s almost poetry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus there’s The Doors connection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also always took it as reference to the Doors’ song “My Eyes Have Seen You,” that goes, “… under the television sky! Television sky!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lyrics sites — and my ears, this evening — say it’s actually plural: “television skies!” But that doesn’t make any difference.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve always loved it — that opening, in particular. I mean, I’m fond of the book, but don’t go back to it that often; but the opening is unforgettable.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In having a look around before writing this, I discovered that <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/books/neuromancer.asp">there’s an extract on Gibson’s site</a>, which reminds me that it&rsquo;s all that good. Reading that extract, what think of most is the beats, or Hunter S Thompson.</p>
<p>And interestingly it isn’t done with the sky after the first line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you couldn’t see the lights of Tokyo for the glare of the television sky</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By day, the bars down Ninsei were shuttered and featureless, the neon dead, the holograms inert, waiting, under the poisoned silver sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which last point suggests that Jack’s over-literal concern about the meaning of the opening might have an answer: maybe the sky was <em>literally</em> that staticy colour of an old TV between channels. If so, I don’t think we ever got a reason for it. But it’s implied there has been at least one war in the not-too-distant past of the novel.</p>
<p>Opening lines are so important. To my mind Gibson’s is up there on that bright, cold day in April, just around Barstow on the edge of the desert, with an exploding grandmother.</p>
<p>But to each their own, of course.</p>

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/02/28/tory-mp-claims-astrology-could/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-02-28 08:21:25 &#43;0100">Feb 28, 2017</time></a>

			 <html><body><p>This should be enough to disbar someone from public life for good: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/25/astrology-help-nhs-claim-conservative-mp-david-tredinnick?CMP=share_btn_tw">Astrology could help take pressure off NHS doctors, claims Conservative MP</a> — The Guardian. Though I notice the article is two years old. It just came to my attention via <strike>Facebook</strike> one of Twitter’s occasional emails.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  David Tredinnick said astrology, along with complementary medicine, could take pressure off NHS doctors, but acknowledged that any attempt to spend taxpayers’ money on consulting the stars would cause “a huge row”.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Getting his defence in early, he goes on to say that his likely critics (he names Brian Cox specifically):</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “… are also ignorant, because they never study the subject and just say that it is all to do with what appears in the newspapers, which it is not, and they are deeply prejudiced, and racially prejudiced, which is troubling.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nice tactic: he knows he’s talking bullshit, so accuses people of racism. Last time I checked, astrology wasn’t a race.</p>
<p>Nor was stupidity.</p>
<p>And in the unlikely event that anyone reading this thinks I’m just being reflexively mean and as bad as the critics he fears, here’s a considered scientific opinion. The only possible known way the positions of the planets and stars at our birth could affect us is by gravity. And while gravity does travel all through the universe, it is very, very weak — the weakest of the fundamental forces. Just look at how hard it was to measure gravitational waves. We were only able to do that in the last year, and it took colliding black holes to make enough of a splash for us to measure.</p>
<p>Is it possible that heavenly bodies affect us in some other, as yet unknown way? Yes. And here’s what science says about that: show us how, and we’ll study it. Demonstrate the mechanism by which this influence happens, and we’ll write down the equations that govern it and learn all about it. We’ll have to throw out all existing models of physics, but if you bring the evidence, that’s what we’ll do.</p>
<p>That’s science.</p>

			 <html><body><p>More trouble with the home network today. We had a smart electricity meter installed a few days ago. Though without the “smart” part, because they couldn’t get a good enough signal down in our basement. You’d think they’d have considered that possibility in designing them, since that’s the kind of place where a lot of people’s meters are. Anyway, I think it was interfering with our powerline connection.</p>
<p>We have a BT HomeHub as our main router and connection out to the fibre. But the wifi was a bit crap up at the top of house. So about a year back I got a couple of powerline connectors and used them to extend the 5GHz network upstairs, using another router that we had accidentally acquired as the other access point.</p>
<p>It worked fine, until just the other day. The first symptom was that the Sonos app couldn’t connect to the speaker. I did some diagnosis, and everything was just weird. We could mostly connect to the outside world without any trouble, but I couldn’t connect to the HomeHub’s web interface by name. Nor, I think, by IP address. And then in one of my experiments I tried a slightly different IP address (one that shouldn’t have existed on our network), and I found myself at… a Sky box.</p>
<p>Now you know my dislike for that bunch. There’s no way I’d let their networking hardware on my LAN, any more than I’d subscribe to their channels. and in any case, just, what?</p>
<p>I wondered if our network could somehow have got crossed with one of the neighbours’. But it seemed so improbable. The neighbouring network would need to be using the same <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-service-set-identifier-816547">SSID</a>, at the very least.</p>
<p>As you’d imagine, I started taking components out to try to isolate the problem. With just the BT HomeHub in place, things were back to normal. But as soon as I began adding parts, everything went weird.</p>
<p>Eventually I concluded — guessed, really — that the smart meter might be using powerline itself. We’re supposed to get a screen-based device for monitoring usage, and maybe that communicates with the meter over powerline. And the meter could have an embedded sky router? That seems unlikely, but maybe Sky have the contract to do the phoning home for EDF.</p>
<p>Anyway, since the root of the problem seemed to be at least partly to do with IP address conflicts, I decided to factory-reset everything and rebuild with a different IP address range (I’ve never used <code>172.16.0.0</code> before). Along with a new wifi SSID and password.</p>
<p>And so far so good. But I’m having trouble getting the second router to route properly via the first, so upstairs is going to be problematic till I can solve that.</p>
<p>All this is doing, of course, is making me wish that we could get <a href="https://eero.com">Eeros</a> in the UK. A self-configuring mesh network is exactly what we need, and not all this jerry-rigged nonsense.</p>

<p>You’ve got to wonder, though, why is the government bothering to fight it? It’s just a waste of public time and money. Who suffers by removing the difference?</p>
<p>Well, on that last, according to the <cite>Guardian</cite> article:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Jean Rathbone, a celebrant for humanist ceremonies, said opposition to extending civil partnerships came from the “marriage industry and the church.”

<p>The “marriage industry?” I didn’t know there was such a thing. But the term makes sense when you think of the crazy amounts of money people can spend on weddings.</p>

<p>It is, as I say, interesting. But it’s also profoundly annoying in the way he asserts that the human brain is not an information processor, but then makes no attempt to explain what it <em>is</em>, instead. </p>
<p>He asserts that the brain does not hold a copy of a song it has learned, for example, but instead “is changed in a way that allows the person to sing it” (I paraphrase).</p>
<p>But isn’t that just another way of saying that it <em>has</em> stored a copy? If that change does not in some sense denote making a copy, then what exactly does it mean? What is the brain doing when the singer recalls the song? Inventing it anew, exactly (or not) as the original composer intended?</p>
<p>I don’t doubt that what he calls “[t]he information processing (IP) metaphor of human intelligence” has its limitations; but he has completely failed to explain them or provide an alternative explanation.</p>
<p>The truth is we don’t understand much about how the brain does what it does; and this guy knows more than most of us. But he’s a psychologist. He no doubt has a deep understanding of the workings of the human <em>mind</em>. But I think if you want someone to explain what we understand of the workings of he human <em>brain</em>, then you want that person to be a neuroscientist.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Yeah, OK, so I missed my deadline: I’m typing this after midnight. But it’s still the same day I got up in, in sleep-cycle terms. Also in terms of how the TV listings mags give the days, too. Which can actually get a little bit confusing sometimes.</p>
<p>It stems, of course, from the days when all TV would have stopped by midnight or shortly after. Yes, kids, I know it’s hard to imagine, but TV stations used to “close down” at night. One or other of the channels used to even have a wee programme that was actually called <cite>Closedown</cite>, if I remember correctly. I think it was one of the weird religious things, where a priest or minister would come on and give a <cite>Thought for the Day</cite> kind of mini sermon.</p>
<p>Anyway, and still on TV, apparently the best comedy show around, <cite>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</cite>, is having that annoying recent habit, a mid-season break. We have no idea when it will be back. And… well, if you’ve watched it…</p>
<p>No, I’m not going to say any more about it. Just hurry up and get back, guys.</p>
<p>I may actually backdate this post, just so my daily posting doesn’t show a gap. After all, I’m treating it as still Thursday 16th of February, even if the clock doesn’t.</p>

			 <p>Do you ever look around and think how amazing everything is? How it all got there? And I’m not talking about the grandeur of nature, the glory of the universe, and all that. I’m talking about all the human-made stuff.</p>
<p>I have often found myself in the middle of a city, or looking out of a train window at a bridge or power station, and thought, “Wow: people built this. Just ordinary people, like me, actually made all this.”</p>
<p>Look at ancient buildings and you realise that they used to do it without the help of modern machinery, too.</p>
<p>And then think about the infrastructure that’s carrying these words from where I’m typing them to where you’re reading them. Hundreds of miles of fibre and copper cables across the country. Thousands of miles of undersea cables. Satellites, and the rockets to launch them.</p>
<p>We’re pretty amazing sometimes, us humans.</p>
<p>Like I say, I’ve often thought about this kind of thing. But today, while not at work because I’m a bit under the weather <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I had a slightly different version of it.</p>
<p>I had a sudden, overwhelming sense of how much <em>cultural</em> work we have created.  Specifically stories and TV and films. Though in fact it was comics that really triggered it.</p>
<p>As I say, I’m not at my best, so I wanted something simple. I ended up reading a bunch of comics on <a href="https://marvel.com/comics/unlimited/home?&amp;options%5Boffset%5D=0&amp;totalcount=12">Marvel Unlimited</a>. And no matter how many I could read in a day, I could only make the tiniest of scratches in the surface.</p>
<p>And in TV, Netflix seem to have a new original series or two coming out every week.</p>
<p>It’s not all great, of course. But just think of all those people, writing away, acting, filming. Making things.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This is the burning question of the day: why are our elected representatives in parliament behaving like idiots, frankly?</p>
<p>I wrote most of this a few days ago, but the question still stands.</p>
<p>The “it,” in case it’s not obvious, is waving through the bill to enable to government to trigger Article 50. They did so with very little scrutiny, and without accepting a single amendment. Now as <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/16/the-only-good-brexit-is-no-brexit/">I’ve made clear</a>, I’m firmly of the opinion that Brexit must be stopped. But it’s looking increasingly likely that it won’t be.</p>
<p>We in the populace may have to accept that fact. But members of parliament don’t. They are (or were) exactly the ones who could have stopped it all.</p>
<p>It’s like there’s a bus full of schoolkids. The driver has lost control, and it’s careering towards a cliff edge. The driver jumped out and somehow survived. But the kids can’t get off. Luckily there’s another adult aboard. She grabs the wheel. Hooray, the kids will be saved as she swerves and brakes.</p>
<p>But wait: oh no, she isn’t braking. She’s steering more directly towards the cliff, and putting her foot down.</p>
<p>And all the people who could stop her are at best letting her go on, at worst egging her on. Even the ones who said they didn’t want to go over the cliff in the first place.</p>
<p>This simile may be getting out of hand.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>A very small hope. <a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/brexit-take-back-control">Brexit—take back control</a> by the improbably-named Jolyon Maugham, suggests that a court ruling could be achieved which would ensure that we can back out of Brexit at the last moment:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The effects of an Article 50 notification are not fully understood—and not only because May is still peddling a blind bargain, a Brexit pig-in-a-poke. We do know that, should we ask and the other 27 member states agree, we could remain. But it is brave to assume that two years of exposure to the negotiating skills of Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and David Davis will not generate even one hold-out. [...] The preponderance of legal opinion is that we could, after all, decide to remain. That we could, having notified, withdraw that notification. But, given the magnitude of the issue, our parliament must know more than what the answer probably is. It must know what it actually is.<br>
  [...]<br>
  only the court to which we all subscribe can give an answer: the European Court in Luxembourg.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He/she (I’m guessing “he,” from the writing style) says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  But a case which—along with Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley, Steven Agnew, a Green member of the Northern Irish Assembly and Keith Taylor, a Green MEP—I am bringing in the Dublin High Court seeks to give us the power to travel back if we need it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And he explains that:</p>
<blockquote>
  We access it via a national court. And it can’t be one of ours. One of the complaints in the Dublin case is that the other 27 have breached the Treaty by excluding us from Council meetings before we’ve notified under Article 50. And that complaint can only be made by a court in one of those 27. The Irish court is the natural choice
</blockquote>
<p>Which all seems fair. The idea seems to be that the European Court of Justice could rule definitively that we could revoke our triggering of Article 50 at the end of the two-year negotiating period. And if the deal is bad, or especially if there isn’t one, parliament is likely to call another referendum in those circumstances, wherein we’ll know exactly what we’re voting for, and get it right this time.</p>
<p>A small hope, like I say. And it doesn’t protect us from the damage that’s being inflicted in the meantime.</p>
<p>But a small hope is better than none at all.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Just tried and failed to book Dylan tickets. Three nights at the London Palladium in April. I got an email from Songkick telling me about it yesterday, and jumped straight on it.</p>
<p>To learn that tickets didn’t go on sale till 10:00 today. At which time I was going to be traveling to King’s Cross to get a train to Edinburgh, which is a wee bit inconvenient.</p>
<p>As it happened by just after ten I was <em>at</em> KX, and buying my lunch for the journey. But of course at that time I had forgotten about the tickets. By the time I remembered it was 12:44. The Palladium only holds just over 2000, so there wasn’t much hope.</p>
<p>But I wasn’t helped by Ticketmaster’s ludicrous captcha overkill. Seemed like every time I moved from one page to another I had to click an “I am not a robot” checkbox and then select all the pictures containing street signs, or pickup trucks, or storefronts, from an array of tiny shitty pictures. Pickup trucks and storefronts? We barely have the former in this country, and we don’t use the latter term. And sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s in the pictures. I was doing this on a phone, after all.</p>
<p>I wonder how serious their problem with automated ticket-buying bots is. I guess it must be an issue, given that the whole business of an inflated resale markets and touts at venues still exists.</p>
<p>Anyway, all gone in London, but you may have a chance elsewhere.</p>

			 <html><body><p>The word “optics” used to mean the science of light. It still does, of course, but it now also refers to “how things look,” in terms of public image and so on.</p>
<p>And from what I can tell it has only come into this use in the last year or so. I first heard it on tech podcasts, but it was recently in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/27/never-mind-the-optics-theresa-mays-us-dash-was-mortifying?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">front-page headline</a> (though the second story) in <cite>The Guardian</cite>. And I heard it on the telly. I think it was in <cite>Agents of SHIELD</cite>, wherein they included an explanation of what it means.</p>
<p>I can see how it can be used in its new meaning, but how did it come to be used that way?</p>
<p>And it seems that I’m right that it’s relatively new: Wikipedia, googling: both only turn up definitions like “the branch of physics to do with light.”</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=optics&amp;defid=3694000">Urban Dictionary’s top definition</a> is exactly what I’m talking about:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What something will look like to the outside world; the perception a public relations person would have on something. First seen (at least by me) in article by Equity Private on finance blog dealbreaker
</p></blockquote>
<p>Economists repurposing words from real science to dismal? Sounds entirely plausible.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I saw a hashtag on Twitter this evening: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InternationalClashDay">#InternationalClashDay</a>. Well, it doesn’t take a lot, and now my <em>actual</em> favourite Clash song is blasting out of the Sonos: “Death or Glory,” from <cite>London Calling</cite>.</p>
<p>I say “actual” because if asked I would usually say that “(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais” is my favourite Clash song (if not overall favourite song, and very probably that too). And then I listen to <cite>London Calling</cite> again, and am reminded of the glory of “Death or Glory.”</p>
<p>If anyone ever asks who my favourite band is I’ll unhesitatingly say, “The Clash.” Almost unthinkingly, which may not be good; but some things become part of us.</p>
<p>I can almost remember when I first heard them properly. It was at Bob McGarry’s house. He played a single and then tried to impersonate John Peel, saying, “Those were The Clash,” which is how Peelie often used to back-announce things in those days. I don’t recall what track it was: “White Riot,” probably. I wasn’t overwhelmed, to be honest. It certainly didn’t have a life-changing feeling; not like when I heard Stiff little Fingers’s “Wasted Life,” possibly in the same house, or maybe it was in Brendan Conroy’s. I must write about that one someday.</p>
<p>But other songs and albums were waiting. I can’t honestly say what it was that finally did it for me. Maybe “Tommy Gun” or “English Civil War.” Maybe “White Man” itself. I do know that shortly after <cite>London Calling</cite> was released, my friend Steven Watt said to me, “I envy you: you haven’t heard <cite>London Calling</cite> yet.”</p>
<p>Somewhere in there, though — after I bought my first copy of <cite>London Calling</cite> for £3.99<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and before I bought <cite> Sandinista</cite> for the same price — I was fully onboard, and searching for all the old singles in Glasgow record shops.</p>
<p>Writing that makes me think that the point of transition might actually have been when I saw my friends’ band The Varicose Veins<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> doing “Clash City Rockers.” In which case a cover version was key. Which is fine. One of The Clash’s most famous songs, “I Fought the Law,” was a cover, after all.</p>
<p>I should probably be able to explain <em>why</em> they mean so much to me, but I’m not sure I can. It’s probably a combination of affinity for their viewpoint, the sheer raw energy of their early songs, and their lyrics.</p>
<p>But maybe not. Maybe it’s just that the golden age of music is around 14-15, and lessons learned then — lessons burned on the soul — stay with us.</p>
<p>“The only band that matters.” It’s been quoted so often it’s become a cliché. But that doesn’t mean it’s not true.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Part of any kind of bug or problem reporting system is triage: the act of deciding how severe each report is and placing it into the appropriate category.</p>
<p>Common categories in software development are things like “Critical,” “High,” “Medium” and “Low,” for example. They would usually be given associated numeric values: probably 1-4, in this case.</p>
<p>I realise that I mentioned “triage,” which of course means dividing things into three; and then I’ve introduced four levels. That would be quadage, maybe? Tesserage? Anyway, three levels wasn’t enough for people: at some point “High,” “Medium” and “Low” just couldn’t cut it.</p>
<p>But even the terminology is breaking down now. This snippet below is based on values from an actual document written by an actual company, for reporting problems during user acceptance testing (UAT).</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Severity</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1 – Extremely critical</td>
<td>Critical problem that completely stops testing…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 – Very critical</td>
<td>Critical problem that prevents some testing…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 – Critical</td>
<td>Non-critical problem…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4 – Less critical</td>
<td>Minor bug…</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Imagine if they used that in hospitals: “The patient’s critical.” “Oh, not too bad, then.”</p>

			 <p>Yes, yes, it’s all very meta: all I ever write about is blogging.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But that is exactly what I want to talk about today: is a blog better if it is only on one subject?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I suspect that the most successful blogs in terms of size of readership are fairly closely focused on a single subject. I read several technology blogs, such as <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="https://sixcolors.com">Six Colours</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net">MacStories</a>, which all write mainly about technology with an Apple slant. They have all achieved success by keeping that focus.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, there are some highly enjoyable ones that take a broader scope: Tim Bray’s <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Ongoing</a>, John Scalzi’s <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com">Whatever</a>, or <a href="http://wilwheaton.net">Wil Wheaton</a>‘s blog; those authors write about whatever<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> takes their fancy.</p>
<p>I, as you’ll have noticed, take the latter tack. But the question is, should I be more focused? Should I concentrate on writing about politics, say?<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>It’s worth considering, certainly, but here’s the thing: I’m not actually sure what I would focus on. I don’t think I have the single-mindedness to keep to the same subject. I value the flexibility of the old-school, personal blog.</p>
<p>Which is just as well, since that’s what I seem to be writing. So there you go.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Something I forgot to mention <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/02/03/the-origin-of-the-bitface/">yesterday</a> was that I thought the “bitface” term was useful not just to refer to people who manipulate bits for a living (or hobby) — programmers, like myself. It can also work to discuss anyone who makes digital content: websites, blogs, podcasts, videos, photos, and so on.</p>
<p>We’re all moving bits around. We’re all labourers at the bitface.</p>

			 <p>Things go quicker than you think. This <del datetime="2017-02-03T20:55:21+00:00">tweet</del> post<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was inspired by a tweet, and I thought it wasn’t too long ago. But in fact it was April last year.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/FlyLogical/status/725193615505510400">Yusuf’s tweet</a> inspired me to finally write about the term “biftace” and why I chose it and what it means. Actually I thought I had written this before, but it seems not.</p>
<p>So a long time ago, when I was first thinking of a name for my blog — before it even existed, indeed — I thought about the way the press used to refer to teachers working “at the chalkface.” The analogy with miners at the coalface was probably originally meant to disparage the labour of teachers as being less than that of miners. I’m guessing here, but considering the term seems to have originated in tabloid journalism, and tabloids tend to be disparaging of anything intellectual — though to be fair, they haven’t exactly been friends to miners either, over the years.</p>
<p>Anyway, I quite liked the term, and wanted to come up with something similar to refer to my own industry, that of programming. I tried out one or two for size, at least in my head. “Byteface” felt more accurate (it’s rare for an application programmer to care to much about bit-level things, and I mainly write Java, which compiles to bytecode); but it didn’t feel right.”Codeface” would have been another, but again, didn’t feel right.</p>
<p>“Bitface” did feel right, and so an early version became “The Bitface Diaries.” I don’t think I ever made that live.</p>
<p>When I started <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com">my Livejournal</a> (which nowadays is just one of my syndication targets) I went with “Tales from the Bitface,” which I still like. And then when I decided to set up my own site I went with “A Labourer at the Bitface,” which harked back to the original impetus for inventing the word, and also alluded to my support for the Labour Party.</p>
<p>Which means I’m considering a rename now, as I consider my future in said party. But that’s another blog entry.</p>
<p>The conversation with with Yusuf was about hardware, which is not what the term was about. But I never worked out what we should call working with hardware in similar terminology.</p>

<p>Not that I’ll actually need a username on the site, I don’t think, as I expect to be using it to post short entries here, syndicated to Twitter. But it won’t hurt to have it.

			 <p>I’ve been saying for a while now that Brexit is worse than Trump, because Trump is only for four years<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> — less if he gets impeached or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">twenty-fived</a>, which is almost certain; but Brexit is forever.</p>
<p>But Trump is moving so fast, following through so fiercely on his campaign promises, that even if he doesn’t last, he’s going to do incredible damage to the USA, and to the world.</p>
<p>And then there’s pieces like “<a href="https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/trial-balloon-for-a-coup-e024990891d5#.eeznnm5dr">Trial Balloon for a Coup?</a>,” which, along with the stories it links to, is terrifying. If the things suggested there were to come true, Trump and his successors could be forever, too.</p>
<p>And even if they manage to get rid of him, that means Pence takes over, which would be its own class of awful. He at least knows something about government and the Constitution, though. I guess?</p>
<p>So I don’t know. Brexit, if we can’t stop it, is going to be bad for the economy, jobs, and society; but despite the hard-right support for it, I don’t think it means the country is being turned into a fascist state. On the other hand, after a Tory-led hard Brexit they could make the UK into what they’ve always wanted: a tax-haven for the rich and sweatshop for the poor, with permanent austerity policies.</p>
<p>And there’s no opposition to speak of.</p>
<p>But Trump…</p>
<p>But Brexit…</p>

			 <html><body><p>There are certain interesting TV programmes that I’d like to see but I can’t watch for ethical reasons.</p>
<p>If you’ve been around here much  before you’ll be familiar with my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/07/12/boycott-news-international-for-life-i-already-did/">contempt for Rupert Murdoch</a> and all his works. I’m far from alone in that attitude, of course. But this means, most notably, that I would never get Sky TV. That has only ever mildly bothered me on the odd occasion when they’re showing a film I’d like to see that isn’t available elsewhere.</p>
<p>But things have taken a turn for the worse lately, and it’s largely the fault of an American TV company that I generally heartily approve of: HBO.</p>
<p>Actually the rot probably started to set in when Sky got the rights for <cite>Mad Men</cite> Season 5, after the first four had been on BBC 2. I’ve still never got round to seeing the later seasons.</p>
<p>But the problem with HBO shows is that Sky has the exclusive UK right for something like five years. And that means I haven’t been able to see <cite>Westworld</cite>. Which is a shame, because everyone was talking about it a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>More worryingly by a long way for me, though, is that the new series of <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, which is not being made by HBO, but something called Showtime. It’s due out in May, I believe, and guess who has the UK rights?</p>
<p>Showtime seem to have a streaming service, so maybe that’ll work here. I wouldn’t be surprised if it didn’t, though.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in doing some research when writing this, I discovered that <cite>Westworld</cite> is available to download via iTunes, so maybe the same will be true for <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>.</p>
<p>Either way, it’s going to cost. It would be a lot better if these kinds of things could go to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv">proper channels</a>.</p>

			 <html><body><p>You may think my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/28/rezillos-gig/">last post</a> was late, in that I didn’t post it on Saturday, but rather today, Sunday. And that is literally true. However, I wrote the original draft of it on Saturday morning. I then saved it as a draft in WordPress (or so I thought).</p>
<p>Later that day, while I was out and about, I tried to put the finishing touches to it and post it. But I couldn’t find it. It didn’t appear in the list of posts in WordPress.</p>
<p>And it was nowhere to be found. Luckily I had written most of the draft in a text editor (<a href="http://www.bear-writer.com">Bear</a>, to be specific), and that was still there. So I was able to recover it. And WordPress lets you override today’s date when you post an entry, so I was able to make it be dated on the day it was actually written. I’m giving myself that one, as meeting <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/01/the-year-turns-again/">my challenge</a>. I wrote it on the day, even if I didn’t post it till the day after.</p>
<p>But ths is the second time recently that I’ve lost a draft. An email <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/15/the-strange-case-of-the-lost-reply/">the last time</a>, but it feels like a worrying trend. I’m going to have to be more careful with things.</p>
<p>On the positive side, today’s post just wrote itself.</p>

			 <html><body><p>To the <a href="https://229.london">229 venue</a> on London’s Great Portland Street last night, to see the Rezillos, <a href=https://devilgate.org/2007/10/18/the-return-of.html">about whose reformation I’ve written before</a>, here. I didn’t go to see them back then, so last night I put that right. I had never even heard of this place before, but apparently <a href="http://www.229thevenue.com/about-229/">it’s been around since the sixties</a>. Nice place: good sound system, and fair beer (though the Punk IPA was off).</p>
<p>We had a support band called the Tuts, who are three women from  Brighton, and the first band I’ve instantly fallen for since Savages.</p>
<figure>
<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://devilgate.org/uploads/2023/fullsizeoutput-5ae.jpeg" alt="he Tuts at 229" title="he Tuts at 229" border="0" width="600" height="450" />
<figcaption>Despite what the backdrop and bass drum say, this was actually the Tuts.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Those are they. Check them out if you can.</p>
<p>And then we had the support band that I knew about in advance: Spizz Energi, who are a similar vintage to The Rezillos, and with similar SF-related sensibilities — at least as far as a couple of songs go. But on the night — and after the Tuts — they were actually quite dull.</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://devilgate.org/uploads/2023/img-4966.jpg" alt="Spizz Energi at 229" title="Still not the Rezillos." border="0" width="600" height="450"></p>
<p>But the Rezillos killed it. They were utterly fantastic. Eugene was playing guitar for the first song or two, which surprised me, but he soon put that away and just sang, along with Fay, of course.</p>
<p>My only slight regrets were that we didn’t get “Thunderbirds Are Go” or “Teenbeat.” But all the other top hits were there.</p>

<p>I realised as I was there that I only ever Instagram from gigs these days. Gig-gramming, I hereby christen it, though I expect I’m not the first.</p>

			 <p>Further to my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/24/i-wrote-to-my-mp/">letter to Diane Abbot</a>, I saw her last night on <cite>Question Time</cite>. Disappointingly she was trotting out the line that, irrespective of what they believe, MPs are now tied down by the “democratic will of the people.”</p>
<p>That is utter nonsense.</p>
<h2 id="did-the-referendum-give-a-democratic-mandate">Did the Referendum Give a Democratic Mandate?</h2>
<p>The referendum, as <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/06/25/sixty-three-percent/">I have said before</a>, did not provide a sufficient majority to change the country’s constitution. In fact, it did not provide a majority at all: thirty-seven percent of the electorate voted to leave. That is under <em>no</em> circumstances a democratic mandate.</p>
<h2 id="do-mps-have-to-abide-by-the-referendums-result">Do MPs Have to Abide by the Referendum’s Result?</h2>
<p>The referendum was advisory, not binding. That was very clear in the act of parliament that enabled it, though it wasn’t mentioned at all in the discussions running up to the event itself. The MPs were asleep at the wheel when the bill went through parliament: if they had given it the thought it deserved, they would have made its advisory nature explicit in the wording of the question; and more importantly, they would have set a proper threshold for it to take effect. A two-thirds majority is common in cases like this.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>MPs make up the house of commons, half of parliament, the sovereign body in the UK. Their role is to scrutinise legislation and to vote on it in accordance with what they understand to be the best interests of the country.</p>
<p>No-one can say that Brexit would be in the best interests of the country. (Well, OK, they can say it; but they are demonstrably wrong.) MPs not only <em>can</em> vote against the triggering of Article 50: doing so is their <em>duty</em>.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-most-mps-switched-to-being-in-favour-of-brexit">Why Have Most MPs Switched to Being in Favour of Brexit?</h2>
<p>Or at least that’s the way it seems.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know. I  have my theory, though. They are running scared of the tabloid newspapers. And maybe, as one of my friends suggested on Facebook the other day, literally scared for their lives if they were to resist the Brexit onslaught. Remembering the tragedy of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36555996">Jo Cox</a>, of course.</p>
<p>If the latter is really why they are doing it, then the terrorists have won. And even if it’s only fear of the tabloids, then the tabloid terrorists have won. If I were inclined that way I would call the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> and <cite>Sun</cite> traitors to their country for trying to ruin the British economy and damage British society, by forcing us out of the EU and assaulting the European Convention on Human Rights (which, if it needs to be said again and again, was written by Britons and is nothing to do with the EU).</p>
<h2 id="whats-to-be-done">What’s to be done?</h2>
<p>Buggered if I know. If our democratically elected representatives won’t do what they’re elected for and act in the best interests of the country, then I can only conclude that we’re fucked.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I listen to a fair number of podcasts, but I only recently learned that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Axelrod">David Axelrod</a> has one now. Axelrod was Barack Obama’s chief strategist and then Senior Advisor.</p>
<p>On a recent episode of <a href="http://podcast.cnn.com/the-axe-files-david-axelrod/episode/all/E2PZtocfVZcHEI/1uckf4.1-1.html">his podcast, <cite>The Axe Files</cite></a>, he interviewed Barack Obama, during his last few days as president.</p>
<p>They’re friends, so it’s not what you’d call hard-hitting. But it is interesting. Obama as always comes across as personable, thoughtful, and very, very smart.</p>
<p>Which only makes the current occupant of his erstwhile office seem even worse.</p>
<p>But I highly recommend giving <a href="http://podcast.cnn.com/the-axe-files-david-axelrod/episode/all/Yg1u54uYTmB7Mb/me1tyh.1-1.html">the episode</a> a listen.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Started towards the end of last year, interrupted for Christmas and <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/03/the-secret-of-twin-peaks-by-mark-frost-books-2017-1/">post-Christmas reading</a>, and taken up again later. But yes, you read that right: I interrupted reading a Banksie. Now even though it’s a reread, that’s not something that happens normally.</p>
<p>But then this is not a normal Banksie. My memory of it was that although I hadn’t loved it, it was good enough. But all I remembered from it was two scenes, and the overall background.</p>
<p>I’ve got to say now, I’m afraid, that it’s down there with <cite>Canal Dreams</cite> as my least favourite. In fact when I reread <cite>Canal Dreams</cite> at some point in the past, I found it was better than I had remembered. This, though: this was worse than I remembered.</p>
<p>I mean, it’s not <em>terrible</em>. If it were written by someone else, it would probably be fine. But no more than that, I’d imagine: no more than <em>fine</em>.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with it? Well, it’s just not compelling in the way I expect Banks’s books to be. There are no  characters to speak of, except for the narrator, who is not especially endearing. That shouldn’t matter, but he’s not particularly anything else, either. His attitude to the war-torn environment in which he finds himself is essentially that it is inconveniencing him (and, to be fair, depriving him of his ancestral home).</p>
<p>But the guy owns a castle. I mean, how sympathetic is he going to be?</p>
<p>I don’t know, I think the main problem is just that it’s so bloody <em>bleak</em>. I was convinced that it must have been written while he was getting divorced, or otherwise going through a dark period in his life, but <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Banks">the Wikipedia article</a> doesn’t suggest anything of the sort.</p>
<p>Anyway, there we go. Another reread. But not one that I can imagine coming back to again. And there are plenty others still to come.</p>

			 <html><body><p>So the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38720320">Supreme Court agreed that parliament is sovereign</a> Good for them. Must’ve been a hard decision. I decided it was time to ask my MP, Diane Abbott, to do the right thing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Dear Ms Abbott,</p>
<p>Now that the Supreme Court has made its decision, affirming parliament’s sovereignty, I strongly urge you to vote against triggering Article 50.</p>
<p>The most urgent issue facing our country at the moment is Brexit, and the only solution to Brexit is to stop it happening. As a Labour Party member, and one who voted for Jeremy Corbyn as leader twice, I’m very disappointed by the recent reports that he is planning to require MPs to vote in favour of triggering Article 50.</p>
<p>I know it would be unpopular with certain tabloid papers if parliament were to prevent Brexit. But in truth I think it would be popular in the country. It seems highly likely to me that if there were a second referendum now, the majority would vote in favour of staying in the EU.</p>
<p>That may be wishful thinking, but I don’t believe so: people have both realised they were lied to, and seen something of what Brexit will mean to the economy, to jobs, and to British society.</p>
<p>And in any case, parliament is sovereign, and the majority in the referendum was far too small to justify what is, in effect, a constitutional change. Surely an MP’s duty is to vote in the way that is best for the country, and it is clear that leaving the EU would not be in the UK’s best interests.</p>
<p>I urge you to resist the tyranny of the right-wing press, and go with the majority of Hackney North and Stoke Newington voters, and please: vote against triggering Article 50.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Martin McCallion</p></blockquote>
<p>That ought to do it, eh?</p>

<p>Anyway, a while ago Jalkut wrote and released a kind of “Touch Bar emulator” app for Macs. It simulates on-screen the Touch Bar of the new MacBooks. I just installed it, and it’s really very cool at giving you an idea of what the Touch Bar is like. Obviously you have to use it with the mouse or trackpad, as it doesn’t actually turn a section of the screen touch sensitive, but you can see what features each application offers when the Touch Bar is present, for example.</p>
<p>The only real downside is that it covers up a piece of screen. But it’s easy to toggle it off and on with a key combination.</p>

<p>It was another one where I enjoyed the journey, but the destination was kind of annoying. Though luckily, not quite as annoying as I thought it was going to go at one point during the last episode.</p>
<p>One of those stories where you’re left not knowing what exactly it was trying to say. The ambiguity of the ending is not inherently bad, don’t get me wrong.  I don’t mind an open ending in general. But I think this falls down slightly because it doesn’t address several of the points it raises.</p>
<p><a href="http://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/the-oa-season-1-review">This (non-spoilery) review</a> catches the mood of it all very well. I note that it describes it as “Season 1.” That may not mean there’s any plan for a season 2, though. I’d be surprised if there were, really.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/01/20/hst-nixon">reminds us</a> of Hunter S Thompson’s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/07/he-was-a-crook/308699/">obituary of Richard Nixon</a>, saying it “[f]eels appropriate today” (this was yesterday, of course).</p>
<p>I hadn’t read it in a while, but there are some glorious lines in it:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>
  If the right people had been in charge of Nixon’s funeral, his casket would have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president.<br>
  …<br>
  He has poisoned our water forever. Nixon will be remembered as a classic case of a smart man shitting in his own nest. But he also shit in our nests, and that was the crime that history will burn on his memory like a brand. By disgracing and degrading the Presidency of the United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream.
</p></blockquote>
<p>They were a crooked bunch, though, the Republicans back then. This on Spiro Agnew:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  He was a flat-out, knee-crawling thug with the morals of a weasel on speed. But he was Nixon’s vice president for five years, and he only resigned when he was caught red-handed taking cash bribes across his desk in the White House.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is not exactly accurate according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon">Wikipedia article</a>, but it’s not too far off.</p>
<p>The quote Gruber draws our attention to is this:</p>
<blockquote>
  Some people will say that words like scum and rotten are wrong for Objective Journalism — which is true, but they miss the point. It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place. He looked so good on paper that you could almost vote for him sight unseen. He seemed so all-American, so much like Horatio Alger, that he was able to slip through the cracks of Objective Journalism. You had to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly, and the shock of recognition was often painful.
</blockquote>
<p>Which reminds me of something I’ve been thinking about for a long time. Which is that I don’t think I <em>want</em> journalism to be objective. At least not in the area of political commentary. News is different, of course. But to me the best journalistic writing comes about when the writer’s personality comes through. When their unique voice can be heard in every paragraph. HST was of course the exemplar of that, but you don’t have to be as extreme as him to write things that have some heart and soul about them, that do more than just recite the facts.</p>
<p>Indeed, that journalistic objectivity is part of the problem. The whole he said/she said reporting of science in particular — just think of the way climate change is discussed <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>; or the MMR fake controversy of a few years back. Journalists need to be able say, “This person says x but they’re wrong because of y and z.”</p>
<p>And that isn’t necessarily even being subjective. It’s just being willing to not treat both sides of a debate as equal when they’re not.</p>
<p>Back to HST on Nixon, and the crookedness of the Republicans:</p></p>
<blockquote>
  Two years after he quit, he told a TV journalist that “if the president does it, it can’t be illegal.”
</blockquote>
<p>which is something that Trump has quoted, I believe. Or if not, it’s clear that it’s what <em>he</em> believes.</p>

			 <p>Not a lot to say about today. Trump is president. World War III hasn’t started yet, but presumably he’s got the nuclear codes now.</p>
<p>Actually it’s entirely possible that whoever is responsible for briefing the new president on such matters (and come to think of it, who is it who has that responsibility?) didn’t actually give him the real codes, or the real nuclear football. After all, they’ve probably taken an oath to defend the republic (I’m now assuming it’s somebody military) against enemies domestic and foreign, and one could safely argue that Trump is an enemy of the republic.</p>
<p>Indeed, an enemy of all decent people. But we’re just going to have to live with him now.</p>

One of the elsewheres, as I’ve <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/09/social-media-is-like-the-railways/">mentioned before</a>, is <a href="https://medium.com/@devilgate/">Medium</a>.</p>
<p>Medium, though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/medium-lays-off-50-employees-shuts-down-new-york-and-d-c-offices/">having troubles recently</a>, is in part a platform that other publications can use to build their own sites.</p>
<p>After yesterday’s <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/18/poetry-and-politics/">Politics and Poetry</a> post, I got an email this morning from somebody called Steve Saul, telling me that a new Medium-based publication called EveryVote would like to use my piece.</p>
<p>EveryVote is made by the people who make a site called <a href="http://www.mycongressionalrep.org/">mycongressionalrep.org</a>, which helps people find and get in touch with their representatives in Congress. A bit like <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com">They Work for You</a> over here, I guess, but with a specific stated aim of resisting the Trump regime.</p>
<p>Obviously I’m broadly in favour of their goals, so I had no problem with saying yes to their using my piece. Though it occurs to me that it’s bad professional-writing practice, as they didn’t even suggest payment (and I must admit I didn’t think of it till now). But let’s face it, I’m <em>not</em> a professional writer, even if I’d like to be. And the possibility that more people might come here and read my stuff, or at least read my stuff on Medium, is a genuine one.</p>
<p>“Doing it for the exposure,” to an extent. But not so much, since I had already done it. Anyway, my piece is <a href="https://medium.com/everyvote">currently visible on EveryVote</a></p>

			 <p>I’ve tried various email clients on iOS, but for quite a while now my favourite has been <a href="http://www.dispatchapp.net">Dispatch</a> from Clean Shaven Apps. As well as the many integrations and efficient handling of archiving and deleting emails, I like it because it is one of the only apps that lets you order mail in the One True Way.</p>
<p>Which in case you’re wondering is oldest at the top. Newest at the top is fine for blogs and similar news-based things, but it’s not right for anything else. Call me old-fashioned, but that was the default in Eudora and probably in Mutt and Elm and all those too, and it was and remains the best way.</p>
<p>Even Outlook lets you order it oldest-first. Though disturbingly few people take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s not the point. The point is that today Dispatch let me down. I was typing a reply on my iPad this morning. The reply composition window looks like this:</p>

<p>I did <em>something</em> — I’m not sure what — that made the composition window slide off to the right. Part of it was still visible, so I tried tapping on it. And it disappeared.</p>
<p>There was no prompt, and nothing in my drafts folder. All that I had typed was gone, like tears in rain.</p>
<p>I’ve just been trying to reproduce it, and I can, up to a point: if you slide the compose window to the right it goes off out of the way, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_5ab.jpeg" alt="Fullsizeoutput 5ab" title="fullsizeoutput_5ab.jpeg" border="0" width="450" height="600" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:20px"></p>
<p>Which is actually quite useful, because it makes the compose window non-modal and lets you interact with your other messages. But somehow something can go wrong, even though I can’t make it happen now.</p>
<p>Not the end of the world. I retyped the mail. But that’s not good enough, Dispatch. You have to be able to trust your email client.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I watched the first episode of Netflix’s <cite>The OA</cite> last night. <em>Very</em> interesting. I’m looking forward to watching the rest, and speculating about what “OA” might stand for. “Operational Assistant”? “Overcome with Angst?” I kind of want it to have something to do with UFOs, but that would mean it had to be “Object” something.”Object Activity,” for example.</p>
<p>But none of that would make much sense. And I’m betting that it won’t be anything easily guessable.</p>
<p>One could of course google it, but that would be to walk into a pit of spoilers, and I came into this knowing exactly nothing about it, which is great.</p>
<p>Also watched the first episode of <cite>Person of Interest</cite>, which my son has been singing the praises of for some time. No bad, looks quite promising.</p>
<p>And (a bit of a TV-fest last night) a few episodes of <cite>That 70s Show</cite>, which my daughter has been singing the praises of. Quite funny, quite (but not exactly) like the real 70s. The joke may wear thin, but it should be good until then.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  There’s a strange idea circulating among Mexican currency traders. Well, more of a joke really. But there’s a certain logic to it.</p>
<p>  It goes like this: Instead of spending its precious reserves to defend the peso, Mexico should just buy Twitter Inc. — at a cost of about $12 billion — and immediately shut it down.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea being that it would be the easiest way to stop the Trumpet tweeting negative things about Mexico.</p>
<p>I don’t know, he’d just find another forum, no doubt. Shit, in a week’s time he’ll be able to put whatever he wants on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov">Whitehouse.gov</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [T]hat the idea was even raised in jest shows how just how frustrated Mexicans are that their economy and the value of their savings are at the mercy of the seemingly random musings coming in 140-character bursts from Trump’s Twitter account. It’s a sentiment that presumably would be shared by U.S. investors in companies like, say, General Motors Co. or Lockheed Martin Corp., but in Mexico, the pain, and the accompanying despair, appear to be on a much greater scale.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot more than Mexico is at the mercy of those “seemingly random musings.”</p>

			 <html><body><p>Does it count if you write a blog post just so that you’ve written one today? Well, yes, of course it does. After all, you wouldn’t want to spoil an unbroken run of twelve days. </p>
<p>The purpose of doing this is to make myself write and publish something each day. The act of writing is the thing, even if I don’t have a specific subject to discuss.</p>
<p>I could, for example, mention that while I was <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/03/the-secret-of-twin-peaks-by-mark-frost-books-2017-1/">reading the <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> book</a> recently, I ordered the boxed set on DVD. So I’ve started rewatching that. Only two episodes in (or the pilot and one episode, if you want to describe it that way).</p>
<p>I find there’s a lot I don’t remember, not surprisingly, as I haven’t seen it since the 90s. Each episode comes with an optional introduction by The Log Lady. They are suitably obscure and ambiguous. </p>
<p>I hear today that <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/twin-peaks-gets-showtime-premiere-date-084416565.html">the new series is going to be out in May</a>. How we watch it in the UK is another matter, and I’ll have words to say about that in the future.</p>

			 <html><body><p>It must be well over a year now since I switched my main search engine from Google to DuckDuckGo. I changed partly because of concerns over Google’s handling of privacy issues, and partly just to try out the new one.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo’s results are usually fine, and if you ever can’t find something and you think Google might be better, it’s easy to redirect your search there by adding “!g” at the end. There are other special codes like this, such as “!w” to search Wikipedia.</p>
<p>So it’s all fine. But what I’ve only gradually realised is that I much prefer the Duck’s user interface. And this is for one simple reason: infinite scrolling.</p>
<p>Now, infinite scrolling isn’t always good, and I’m sure it has a negative effect on things like usability and caching, in at least some cases. But on DDG (as I’m sure no-one ever calls it), it makes the whole search experience better.</p>
<p>Because sometimes there are more than ten Interesting hits. Or the interesting ones are long after the tenth. But with Google, you get ten on a page. And then you’ve got to click or touch a link to go to the next ten. And it just feels so old fashioned.</p>
<p>After just a few months on DDG (as we should all start calling it from now on) you can’t go back to Google without feeling a weird interrupt at the end of a page, before you go, “Oh, yeah, gotta click that.”</p>
<p>It’s just an inferior experience.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>There’s a piece in the Guardian entitled “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/09/social-media-fake-news-soundcloud-medium-facebook">Why social media is like the railways – and must be saved</a>. I’m not sure about the title, but it’s a good piece, by Paul Mason (in fact, looking at the URL I suspect that wasn’t the original title).</p>
<p>He starts by talking about <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a>, which is, for me at least, one of those sites that you would never think of going to; you just follow a link to something on it. Mind you, increasingly many sites are like that, and have been since perhaps the early days of blogging. Anyway, Mason says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The Berlin-based music service started as a super-cool platform for people who made music and wanted to share it. Last week, its owners admitted it was losing a million dollars a week, and could run out of cash before the end of the year.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  The whole future of the little orange cloud now rests on whether it can get people to subscribe – for money.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is interesting, and it’s one of those things that the net is a better place for it existing, and I’d be sad to see go away — but I can’t imagine ever subscribing to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In the same week, another achingly cool online publisher, this time of blogs, Medium, also hit trouble.
</p></blockquote>
<p>“Achingly cool”? Medium? I’m not convinced (disclaimer: for what it’s worth, my posts are automatically crossposted to Medium, among other places).</p>
<p>He goes on to talk about how none of the social media sites is profitable, except of course for Facebook. He refers to</p>
<blockquote>
  the ailing internet platforms – not just Soundcloud and Medium but Ello, a wannabe rival to Facebook, and Tumblr
</blockquote>
<p>Tumblr is ailing? that seems surprising, considering how popular it is. But who knows (it’s also one of the other places I mentioned above). He goes on to exhort us to return to these sites, dust off our old user IDs and so on, and enjoy them again:</p>
<blockquote>
  It will feel a bit like time travel – back to the period around 2010-12, when social media was associated with postmodernity, self-produced music and revolt, not fake news, white supremacy and rule by old men. But usage alone will not save the collaborative tools. We need new, cooperative ownership models. If basic word processors are effectively now shipped free with every device, so too could be a nonprofit music-sharing service, a free blogging platform and a place to keep in contact with our friends, without intrusive data-farming and a deluge of ads.
</blockquote>
<p>As to that, a free blogging platform — while not “shipped”, is easily available: <a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>. And there are others, of course. But it links back to what I was <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/07/independent-microblogging/">saying the other day</a>: you’ve got to own your own content if you want it to be safe from services disappearing.</p>
<p>As to that “railways” reference in the title, here’s how he finishes:</p>
<blockquote>
  Medium, Soundcloud and ultimately Twitter are – like the railways – worth saving even if they cannot be run at a profit. 2017 can and should be a year in which the users of platforms reclaim these freedoms not as privileges but as rights.
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve got a lot of time for that view, actually, but those sites are mostly set up on a capitalist model (even if they have a community spirit), and I can’t see that changing any time soon.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This blog runs, like so many others, on Wordpress. Recently I’ve noticed some strange behaviour.</p>
<p>When I posted an entry, it wouldn’t show up. Not at first, and sometimes not for a long time afterwards. The entry was there: you could see it if you followed the link, for example if you came from Facebook or Twitter, to both of which I automatically distribute.</p>
<p>Eventually I did a bit of googling, and it turns out that caching plugins can have this effect. I had caching plugins installed. I disabled them, and suddenly everything was displaying normally.</p>
<p>You want to cache your content to help with the site’s performance. Cached pages should be served from the webserver’s filesystem, rather than generated from the content in the database each time they’re requested.</p>
<p>So I’ll need to investigate getting a plugin that isn’t problematic, but for now, if you’ve noticed anything odd about the site, it should all be be OK again.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Twitter is great in many ways, but it’s far from problem-free. (Thought experiment: if Twitter hadn’t existed, would Trump have got elected?)</p>
<p>The abuse and lack of tools to combat it are of course the major ones. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/ive-left-twitter-unusable-anyone-but-trolls-robots-dictators-lindy-west">Lindy West’s Guardian article on leaving Twitter</a> is only the latest such.</p>
<p>But another problem is the old one of owning your own words. Of controlling the platform on which you publish. I’ve <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/25/self-hosting/">posted briefly about this before</a> (though that was Google, rather than Twitter). Sure, Twitter isn’t likely to go bust and delete everyone’s tweets without any warning. But you never know when they’re going to change a policy, or change ownership, or make some other change that — deliberately or not — shuts down your access, removes your entire history, or otherwise lessens or removes the experience.</p>
<p>There have been attempts to build open alternatives, such as <a href="https://joindiaspora.com">Diaspora</a>, but I confess that I’ve only ever come away from it confused.</p>
<p>It would be better if there were a simple way we could all publish to our own sites, but still get the benefit of Twitter’s network. Say hello to <a href="http://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, a new approach from <a href="http://manton.org">Manton Reece</a>, blogger, podcaster and developer.</p>
<p>It should allow us to post Tweet-style short posts on our own sites, and also send them to Twitter. Which may give us the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>As well as developing the service and the app, he’s writing a book about the subject of indie microblogging, and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing">has a Kickstarter going</a> to help him out. It’s worth offering a few bucks if you’re at all interested in the matter.</p>

			 <p>It ought to be easy to install a software package on Linux. I mean, it usually is. All modern distros ship with package managers, right? So all you should have to do is type (Debian-based example):</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install PACKAGE-NAME
</code></pre>
<p>and away you go. Right?</p>
<p>Well, usually. But today, not for me.</p>
<p>I have a NAS box from Western Digital, which is really a little Linux server with a biggish disk drive. Some time ago I replaced the shipped distro with a newer one, but it was so long ago, and it’s been so quiet and reliable that I can’t remember what version, exactly.</p>
<p>So first, there seems to be no way to interrogate it to see what distro it is. I mean, there <em>must</em> be, and <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/find-linux-distribution-name-version-number/">this page</a> lists several ways, but none of them work on this box. I mean, <code>uname</code> shows me the kernel version and all that, but not the distro.</p>
<p>Anyway, all that doesn’t really matter. I was only doing it to install <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a>, and I was only wanting to install Node so that I could run <a href="https://github.com/stephen/airsonos">AirSonos</a>. We got a <a href="http://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/play1.html">Sonos Play:1</a> for the kitchen recently, and it’s great, but the one weakness is that it doesn’t support playing from an arbitrary source one your phone, such as, say, your podcast app of choice (<a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a>, obvs).</p>
<p>AirSonos is supposed to effectively turn the Sonos into an AirPlay speaker, so you can easily send audio to it from iOS devices. And you want it to be running on a server, so it’s available all the time.</p>
<p>But it turns out that Node does not want to install on my NAS. Either by <code>apt-get</code>, as above, or by downloading the binary and unpacking it. (That installs it, obviously, but it won’t run.)</p>
<p>I’m going to try running <a href="http://sonoair.mihosoft.eu">SonoAir</a> on my MacBook. That’s a wrapper round AirSonos, and obviously it’ll only work (assuming it does at all) when my MacBook is awake. But life’s too short.</p>

<p>But I can’t find any way to get rid of them. The widget details are linked to the Apple News app, and in the app itself you can specify preferences, but it doesn’t seem to affect what appears in the widget.</p>
<p>So if anyone has any idea of how to influence what appears there, please drop me a comment, or tweet me a link or something.</p>
<p>And yes I know I could disable the widget and/or delete the app, but I quite like the idea of it, in principle at least. And yes, I also know that avoiding the views of publications I dislike is only going to increase my own bubble effect. But you’ve got to have standards. I could cope with the Telegraph or even the Times (though I’d prefer not to). But the Sun? Come on.</p>

			 <html><body><p>In case it’s not obvious, the reading year starts and ends on Christmas Day. This was a Christmas present, and is also preparation for the new <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> series, which is due to air sometime this year (though what we’ll have to do to see it in the UK is an open question, and one which I’ll discuss at another time).</p>
<p>Mark Frost was, of course, half of the team that created the original series. This book is presented as a mysterious dossier which has been given to an FBI agent to analyse. It consists of a series of extracts from government and newspaper reports, and comments by someone who signs themselves “The Archivist.” These are further annotated by the FBI agent.</p>
<p>The subject matter is mysteries: the many UFO reports, going back to Roswell and before; the mysterious goings on around Twin Peaks itself; stories of the Illuminati and the masons, and so on. Some of the quoted reports are, I assume, real. Many are part of the <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> universe. As a whole the work is entertaining if you like that sort of thing — which I very much do — if a little unsatisfying. Though it has certainly whetted my appetite for the new series.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Just in case you think that I haven’t been paying attention to recent events… yeah, I know, how likely is that…?</p>
<p>Brexit? Trump? Celebrity deaths? 2016 is well behind us — though regarding Trump and Brexit, the worst is still ahead.</p>
<p>But anyway, I haven’t said anything about my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/05/18/relaunch/">work status</a> since <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/21/recent-events/">back in the summer</a>. So I should bring things up to date.</p>
<p>I had a few interviews, but no serious interest. Then July was ending, and I was beginning to think that soon we’d be going on holiday, and once we got back it would be nearly September. That was longer than I fancied going without having something lined up.</p>
<p>And then I got a call from a recruiter telling me there was a bank in the City looking for someone with my exact skill set for a six-month contract. It was supporting — and to some extent building on — the products that I used to make at Misys. That wasn’t quite what I had seen myself doing. I was looking for something that was more of a change, more of a challenge.</p>
<p>But I went in to talk to them and it all sounded pretty good. A significant number of the people who work there are ex-Misys, and I know them, so it would make for a relatively smooth transition.</p>
<p>But a contract. I hadn’t really intended to go down that route. Still, the idea of being a freelancer appealed. I’d like to have a go at indie development one of these days, and the two can be complementary. We’ll see where that goes. But I decided to go for it. Set up the limited company (more on that in a later post), discussed the contract (including while I was on holiday) and started at the end of August.</p>
<p>And it’s… OK. The people are good, the location is great. But the work is not that interesting, and the internal politics are… interesting.</p>
<p>And there’s the pressure of knowing that you’re dealing (sometimes) with a live system. With real people’s actual money. Having only worked for a software company before, that feels unexpectedly high-pressure.</p>
<p>All things considered, when my contract is up for renewal at the end of February, I don’t think I’ll be renewing it (even assuming they offer it to me, which they probably will). So I’ll be looking for another position shortly. Maybe contract, maybe permanent again. It depends what comes up.</p>

			 <html><body><p>New Year’s Day, by all the fates. Another trip round the sun, another twelve months have passed. As usual I wonder, “Where did that year go?”</p>
<p>I’ve been fairly consistent in blogging over the last year, I think: consistently lightweight, that is. I only missed one entire month, by the looks of it (March). But it’s been infrequent at best.</p>
<p>So as a kind of New Year’s resolution (I don’t really go in for them normally) I’m planning — no, thats probably too strong; <em>proposing</em>, let’s say — to make 2017 the year of blogging every day.</p>
<p><em>Every day</em>. It’s a big challenge, I know. But I think that it’s only if I put it out there publicly that there’s any chance I’ll carry through with it.</p>
<p>Or not. We’ll see. My thinking is that even a traditional link post will count, since I write at least a few words with those.</p>
<p>Anyway, Happy New Year, if you’re reading this and I haven’t wished you it already.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://devilgate.org/2016/12/20/complicity-and-the-business-by/">Complicity and The Business by Iain Banks (Books 2016 16 &amp; 17)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2016/12/20/complicity-and-the-business-by/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2016-12-20 08:09:20 &#43;0100">Dec 20, 2016</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>The big Banksie reread finally gets under way again. There’s no particular connection between these two except that I read them back-to-back over two three days, partly when I was off work sick.</p>
<p><cite>Complicity</cite> is just as brutal as I remembered, though I didn’t remember all the details, which was good. It feels dated now, but that’s partly just because it’s of its time, and partly, I suppose, because I remember reading it back in 1993.</p>
<p><cite>The Business</cite> I remembered even less of — I know I’ve only read it once before, while I think I’ve read <cite> Complicity</cite> twice.  It’s written from a woman’s PoV, and I’m sure some would say it isn’t convincing as such. Hard for me to judge that, but I liked being in the company of the narrator. Probably more so than in the former book.</p>
<p>It’s also Banksie’s first — but not last — to posit a secret (or secretish) organisation with its fingers into everything, that is not an evil conspiracy. Or his first non-SF to do so, at least. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture">The Culture</a> could be described in those terms.</p>
<p>Its major flaw is that there is no real sense that she’s ever in any danger. Even if things don’t turn out quite the way she’d like, the worst that could happen is that her stellar advancement in the titular organisation might be slowed, and maybe she won’t get the married man she’s kind of in love with.</p>
<p>All good fun, though. And they do have one thing in common: they’re both so dated that they spell laptop “lap-top”! Must be a publisher’s quirk, because I don’t think anyone in the real world <em>ever</em> spelt it that way.</p>

			 <p>I just watched the last episode of <cite>Class</cite>, BBC 3′s web-only<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><cite>Doctor Who</cite> spinoff.</p>
<p>It is really, really good. If you haven’t seen it you should stop reading this now and go and watch. Really. I’ll still be here when you get back.</p>
<p>Eight episodes with special guest appearances at the start and (spoilers) the end, about five young people in the famous Coal Hill School. Famous from the very first episode of <cite>Who</cite>, of course, right up to the 50th and beyond. It’s now an academy, not surprisingly. And it seems that it is — or always has been — something of a nexus in space and time.</p>
<p>I’ll not say much more, as it would be hard not to get spoilery. But I will tell a little anecdote of how I watched it.</p>
<p>I saw episode 6 first. Why? Because I was careless, and iPlayer has stupid defaults. I went to the site and searched and found the programme, and started watching the first episode it presented me with. Because that would be the first episode, obviously, right?</p>
<p>Wrong. The rationale is sound: iPlayer is a <em>catch-up</em> service; and the episode you’re most likely to want to catch up on is the current one. So the episode I saw first was 6, “Detained”, which must have been current at the time.</p>
<p>Thing is, I don’t think there can have been a “Previously…” at the start — though there was later — or I think I’d have noticed. I was just impressed with how it started straight in, giving touches of backstory in moments of dialogue, so that by the time the five teenagers were locked in the detention classroom and the plot began to unfold, I was really impressed with this <em>in medias res</em> beginning and compact storytelling.</p>
<p>Well, of course, after that I realised my mistake and went back to the beginning. And when I got to 6 again it <em>did</em> have a “Previously…” But if you didn’t start at the beginning, it was probably the best one to start at.</p>
<p>Is it great? Maybe. It’s certainly got the potential to be so. It’s better than early <cite>Torchwood</cite>, maybe not quite as good as the best of <cite>The Sarah Jane Adventures</cite>. Well worth watching, and I hope there will be more serieseseseses.</p>

			 <html><body><p>A long time ago — a long, <em>long</em> time ago: I can’t have been more than thirteen, maybe younger — I got an accidental book.</p>
<p>It was in John Smith’s in Glasgow: St Vincent Street’s glory. I thought it was now long gone, but <a href="https://twitter.com/BookshopGlasgow">apparently not</a>. I was there, probably with my Mum — no, undoubtedly, as I didn’t go to Glasgow on my own till I was about sixteen — I’m guessing in about January, to spend Christmas money (often given in the form of <a href="http://www.nationalbooktokens.com">Book Tokens</a> in those days, of course).</p>
<p>I bought a stack of books. I don’t now recall what any of them were, but they were almost certainly mostly or entirely SF.</p>
<p>As was the freebie that I got by accident. If memory serves I paid at the checkout and gathered up my books, or more likely the assistant put them in a bag for me, and then when I got on to the train back to Balloch, I took them out to have a look.</p>
<p>And found I had more than I’d bargained for. Worse, more than I’d paid for. There was an extra book in my bag. One that I had never seen before, that I hadn’t chosen. One with an interesting title.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?1763"><cite>Again, Dangerous Visions, Book 2</cite></a>, edited by Harlan Ellison.</p>
<p>My immediate feeling was guilt. I had, effectively, stolen a book. I was a good Catholic boy, and would never have stolen anything.</p>
<p>Then surprise: how had it got there? Presumably the assistant had mixed it up with the purchases of the person before me. There was probably someone sitting on a train right at that moment, realising that one of their books was missing. Poor them.</p>
<p>Poor them, but lucky me. I don’t think I told my Mum it had happened. Or if I did, she must have said not to worry, it was too late to do anything; and that doesn’t sound like her. One way or another, we made no attempt to return it.</p>
<p>But I think among the confusion and excitement of it all, I must have been slightly annoyed that it was the second volume: not much use without that first. And that “Again”: did that mean that the whole thing was some kind of follow-on?</p>
<p>Obviously I know now that it did. When I went to university a few years later and met a community of fans, when they mentioned the famous <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Visions"><cite>Dangerous Visions</cite></a> (non-) trilogy, I had some idea of what they were talking about.</p>
<p>I’d like to say that it was some kind of formative experience. That reading those legendary short stories changed my approach to the genre, or my understanding of fiction, or what have you. But I can’t really say that it did.</p>
<p>I eventually read the stories. Not having the earlier volumes of an anthology doesn’t cause any problem. Though I think I took the original, <cite>Dangerous Visions</cite> out of the library. Some of them were great, but I don’t recall finding any of them particularly memorable (though you never know: some things burrow deep). But one of the titles stuck with me, and is why I started writing this today.</p>
<p>That was “A Mouse in the Walls of the Global Village,” by Dean Koontz. Though I couldn’t have told you who it was by, and I’m quite surprised to find that it’s Koontz, who I think of as a horror author.</p>
<p>It came to mind because of something my beloved was saying about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/26/george-osborne-yuval-noah-harari-conversation?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">this interview between George Osborne and Yuval Noah Harari</a>. She mentioned the “global village” idea, and my mind jumped back to the story and the cascade of memories that go with that book. I downloaded the Kindle version of the book (and the first one) and started writing this.</p>
<p>As I recall, that global village involved telepathy, and is very much not the one we are living in. But that doesn’t matter. It’s time to reacquaint myself with some old New Wave SF.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Long-time HST readers like me will be familiar with this title. It always appeared on the dust jacket or inside the book in the list of other books by the author. But you never saw it anywhere. Back before Amazon, when bookshops were still a common haunt (and dinosaurs roamed the Earth), you used to look all over the shop for Thompson’s work, because it was rarely consistently filed. That is, not every bookshop put it in the right section. After all, what is the right section? History? Sociology? Politics?</p>
<p>Really, the right section is probably “Journalism,” but most bookshops don’t (or didn’t) have such a section.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out that <cite>Screwjack</cite> wasn’t journalism, but fiction, and in any case was a limited-edition release of only a few hundred or so, and when the web and eBay came along, copies used to go for hundreds of pounds or dollars.</p>
<p>Sometime after he died it got a proper release, and I finally got round to buying it. It’s a slim, small-format hardback, containing three stories. And I’ve got to say that just a few weeks after reading them, they’re almost totally unmemorable. So maybe there was a good reason for not releasing them properly all those years.</p>
<p>Oh well. One for the completists.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Been reading this over a period of a year or so, on and off, so it’s not really this year’s book. But that’s no reason not to write about it. It was published in 1994 and consists of interviews with a selection of the women who were relatively newly on the scene, or were established but getting some more visibility, around that time. It was the time of Riot Grrrl, among other movements.</p>
<p>So among the interviewees are Courtney Love, Huggy Bear, Liz Phair, Tanya Donnelly, Kristin Hersh, Kim Gordon… even Bjork. But there’s someone missing from the book. Nearly all of the interviewees, when talking about their influences or other women who were doing something interesting at the time, mention PJ Harvey. And she is not interviewed. Which is a shame. I would have loved to have read her thoughts on making music back then (or now, for that matter). And I’m sure Amy Raphael would have loved to interview her, so I’m guessing she didn’t want to do it.</p>
<p>But aside from that, it’s an interesting work. Very much a document of its time, though no doubt the problems and challenges that these women faced have not changed that much. A similar book today, though, would have a very different complement of interviewees; and indeed would need a different subtitle: women musicians are much more prominent in pop and R&amp;B today, from Beyoncé on down. But maybe not so much in rock, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Well worth a read, though.</p>

			 <p>Now that the new version of Apple’s PC operating system has launched, some thoughts on something that’s been bugging me for a while.</p>
<p>Apple’s OS was called “OS X” from about 2000 or so. At one time it was “Mac OS X,” then at some point they dropped the “Mac” part. Now, of course, they’re dropping the “X,” (and the capital “M”) and going over to calling it “macOS.”</p>
<p>In the old version, I knew that the “X” was the Roman numeral for 10. It was release 10 of their operating system, so that was fine. But I always pronounced it as the letter “X” in my mind. Not least because, as the version numbers incremented, they were presented like this: 10.2, 10.3, and so on. Or more fully, “Mac OS X 10.2.”</p>
<p>So how were we meant to say that? “Mac Oh Ess ten ten point two”? Surely not. You can see why my internal monologue pronounced it “Oh Ess Ex ten point two”.</p>
<p>And so it was and so I left it. I knew the “X” had originally meant “ten,” but I couldn’t imagine that anyone would still pronounce it that way. Until I started listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>Wherein erudite, knowledgable Apple users such as <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a>, or the hosts of the <a href="http://atp.fm">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> were clearly heard to talk about “Oh Ess ten.” Though they mostly avoided saying the full, convoluted, Roman and Arabic mix of numbers. I think I did once hear <a href="http://macsparky.com">David Sparks</a> on <a href="http://www.relay.fm/mpu">Mac Power Users</a> saying “Oh Ess ten ten point eight” (or whatever minor release number it might have been).</p>
<p>Still, I didn’t let it bother me. It wasn’t doing any harm, after all.</p>
<p>But then people started talking about relative sizes. I think I first noticed it when retina screens were being discussed. If you’re going to provide graphical resources to support both retina and non-retina screens, you have to provide versions of the image files at different resolutions. These are referred to in writing as “1x” and “2x” versions.</p>
<p>Now, it is obvious to me that that isn’t a letter “x” there (even thought that’s what I typed), but a multiplication symbol. More properly rendered as “×”.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The idea being that you have the original file, and one at twice the resolution. The multiplication symbol is said as “times.” So we have “one times” and “two times.” Right?</p>
<p>But those pesky podcasts.</p>
<p>Soon they were filled with “one ex” and “two ex.” It was the OS X problem all over again — but this time in reverse!</p>
<p>But I gradually realised I might be wrong in my assessment. Graphics files are complicated beasts, after all. A file suitable for a retina screen doesn’t have twice the pixels needed for an older screen, for example: it has four times as many. There are twice as many on the x-axis and twice as many on the y-axis.</p>
<p>And that’s when I realised that the “x” might refer to the x-axis. Saying a file was “2x” could be shorthand for saying that it had twice as many pixels on both its x- and y-axes.</p>
<p>In which case pronouncing it “two ex” would be right after all. Perhaps the terminology came from developers and designers referring to size of the files.</p>
<p>Except… I have subsequently heard people say other numbers followed by “ex,” when what they clearly meant was a multiplier. Specifically, I heard <a href="http://www.cgpgrey.com">CGP Grey</a> saying “ten ex” when talking about a tenfold increase in something like YouTube subscribers. And he used to be a maths teacher, so he should really know better.</p>
<p>Can we ever escape from this insidious invasion of “ex” into spaces where “times” belongs? Probably not. But it’s disturbing when otherwise-smart people make themselves sound so ignorant.</p>
<p>(And don’t get me started on the full-stop or period character that splits up those version numbers. Hint: it’s “point”, not “dot.”)</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>That may or may not look any different from the letter, depending on the typeface you are seeing it in, but it’s a different unicode character.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <html><body><p>It’s a page-turner, an engrossing thriller. I got through the 1040 pages in about a week of being on holiday in Greece (it would have taken me a lot longer at home, especially if I had been working).</p>
<p>Its biggest flaw is exactly how much of a well-oiled machine it is, how beautifully, unreasonably jigsaw-like the pieces all fit together, so that all the players end up together at he right place at the right time for the denouement (which event itself takes up probably close to 200 pages). It’s a bit — no, <em>extremely</em> unlikely that all of the disparate characters could have come together just as they do.</p>
<p>But by the time it’s clear they’re going to, we’re so engaged with them all that we want it to happen just like it does. It’s only when standing back afterwards (or to be fair, during breaks when in the course of reading) that you we think, “This is actually kind of preposterous.”</p>
<p>But still, preposterous fun.</p>

			 <html><body><p>It is very sad to see all the empty seats at the Olympics in Rio — especially remembering <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2012/07/30/olympian-achievements/">how hard it was to get tickets four years ago</a>.</p>
<p>I expect that not many people in Brazil are well enough off to afford tickets — though you’d think it would be incumbent upon the organisers to set the prices at a level where people could afford them. It’s not as if it’s the ticket-buyers who pay for the bulk of the games’ costs, after all. That would come from the corporate sponsors. Or so I would expect: I don’t have the actual figures.</p>
<p>You’d think that there would be a lot of tourists. I’m sure there are, but it looks like it’s not enough to fill the seats. Maybe getting to Brazil <em>and</em> buying the tickets is just too expensive for many.</p>
<p>And of course there were empty seats visible at London 2012 too, which annoyed everyone — especially when we discovered that many, many seats went to corporate sponsors, who then just didn’t bother to use them. But then, everything was shown as sold out on the ticketing site. Aparently in Rio that is not the case.</p>
<p>Oh well, you get a better view on the telly, anyway.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This is something that I wrote some notes on around the London 2012 Olympics, and just sitting here watching the Men’s Road Race on day 1 of Rio 2016, I thought I’d dig it out and finally post it.</p>
<p>Competitors have to ride stock bikes — no fancy superlight frames or custom wheels; just ordinary commuter-type bikes. They can be set up for the individual, but they must have mudguards and lights and EITHER a rack and one pannier OR the competitor must carry a backpack or messenger bag; the bag to hold a weight equivalent to (say) a laptop and a change of clothes.</p>
<p>The race to be a typical commute distances (say 5 miles?) carried out over normal commuting streets, during rush hour, with normal traffic.</p>
<p>Competitors get disqualified for jumping red lights or going the wrong way down a one-way street; and receive time penalties for going on the pavement (maybe disqualification there too, actually). They may receive a time bonus (or at least clock-stoppage) for unreasonable delays, as for example when an articulated lorry is reversing across the road and holding everybody up.</p>
<p>To be run as time trials with say a one-minute separation, so competitors should not be directly racing against each other.</p>
<p>An alternative version would have them use bikes from the city’s bike-hire scheme. They’d have to turn up at a designated pickup point, wait if a bike wasn’t available, and so on. This has the added advantage that it forces host cities to have or introduce such a scheme, and to keep the bikes well maintained.</p>
<p>It’s  challenge that normal people — ones who commute by bike, at least — could really identify with.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Before the job interview that I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/19/2461/">mentioned the other day</a>, the company asked me to answer some questions in writing. I didn’t get the job, but I was pleased with my written answers (and they presumably helped me to get the interview, at least). So I thought I’d reuse them as a blog post. None of this should be surprising for anyone who knows anything about the software development field, but it’s interesting to reflect on how things have changed across my career.</p>
<h3>What are some of the fundamental changes in your approach to software development you have adopted in the last few years?</h3>
<p>There are two main changes that are fundamental and independent of languages and deployment environments: agile techniques and test-driven development (TDD).</p>
<h4>Agile</h4>
<p>Moving from waterfall to agile development was probably the most significant change to development practices in the industry. We always knew that breaking work down into smaller units led to better estimating, more modular code, and just better software. The genius of agile was to extend that understanding to the period of time spent on a block of work. A two-week sprint, with its work being specifically estimated, planned and developed, is just infinitely more manageable than a project phase lasting months.</p>
<p>Add to that:</p>
<ul>
<li>self-organising teams which include someone from the customer or end user — or at least someone whose role is to represent the user;</li>
<li>accepting that change will happen, and embracing it;</li>
<li>and the discipline of saying that some features <em>won’t</em> be developed;</li>
</ul>
<p>and we have a recipe for success.</p>
<h4>TDD</h4>
<p>Good developers always understood that testing was essential, and did it. But they used to follow a written test plan, or just have an idea of what needed to be tested and work to that. Testing was manual, hard to repeat, and error-prone.</p>
<p>TDD brought automation. So instead of writing a document listing the required tests, we can write code. That inherently makes the tests rerunnable, so regressions get caught before they become a problem.</p>
<p>But almost more important than that is the idea of writing the tests first. In an ideal world you write a comprehensive set of tests, write functional code until all the tests pass, and you’re done. It may not always work out exactly like that — in particular, adding tests to a mature codebase can be problematic — but writing tests first encourages us to write code that is easy to test, which tends to lead to better-designed, more modular code.</p>
<p>An added bonus is that the tests can help to document the code, by showing our expectations. And of course they make refactoring easy and safe, as long as they are in place before you start.</p>
<h3>If you were to start your last project over again, what would you do differently?</h3>
<p>The project I’m thinking of involved rewriting the product’s GUI into a modern, responsive, browser-independent form, using HTML 5 and Twitter Bootstrap.</p>
<p>The existing version was an old frames-based web app that only worked fully in Internet Explorer, and had to be tweaked when each new version of that browser came out. We had long wanted to modernise it, but there were always other demands on development time.</p>
<p>Eventually I got a chance to try a proof of concept for the change. The application uses JSPs and Struts action classes, and the brief was to continue using these as much as possible. I decided to start with one of the main display pages, the one that users spend most of their time in. The idea was to give a quick demonstration of what was possible; and it did, to a point. But what I hadn’t realised was that frames are not part of HTML 5. There are ways to keep using them, but it’s not easy, and not good practice.</p>
<p>So while the new look and feel of a single page was clear, it was far from clear how the various pages would interact, how they would be brought together to form the whole UI,  without frames.</p>
<p>If I were to start the project again now, my first step would be to work out how to link the pages together into a single interface, in the absence of frames. Most likely I would use one or other of the forms of JSP includes.</p>
<p>However, if there was the budget to do a more complete rewrite — by which I mean one that did not necessarily seek to use the existing JSPs — I would probably make much greater use of JavaScript and Ajax, and use the action classes just to provide data to the Ajax calls.</p>
<h3>What is your approach to testing, and how would you test your application?</h3>
<p>I would use a mixture of automated unit testing using JUnit, automated GUI testing, and actual user testing, if at all possible.</p>
<p>This fits well with what I was saying above. There are, broadly, three levels of testing: unit, integration, and system. Though writing automated unit tests is a development activity, rather than a testing one. Certainly we wouldn’t expect dedicated QA testers to work at the unit-test level.</p>
<p>So let’s assume that we have satisfactory unit-test coverage and we are interested in testing the application as a whole. Automation is obviously key here, as well, both because it allows us to easily repeat the tests regularly — for every checkin, in an ideal world (and see below); and because it removes the need for testers to manually step through a written script, which is boring and error-prone.</p>
<p>I have used Selenium for automated GUI testing, with some success. It takes a significant amount of development work, because it’s doing a significant thing, but the effort should pay off.</p>
<p>However, even after all that, there is still no alternative to having someone sit down and actually <em>use</em> the application. Automated testing might pick up outright errors in how the user interaction works. But it won’t catch fine details like misaligned elements, typos in onscreen text, or just generally how it feels to use the application.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits of Continuous Integration?</h3>
<p>Continuous Integration takes us beyond the traditional daily build. It does more than just building, and does it more frequently than just daily.</p>
<p>At the simplest level it ensures that, for every commit, an incremental build of the complete product is made, and all the unit tests are run. In the most advanced case, as well as building and testing, the product can be deployed to test servers and integration tests such as the automated GUI tests mentioned above can be run. Realistically those tend to take longer, so it’s unlikely that you would do them for <em>every</em> commit, but they can certainly be run multiple times daily.</p>
<p>So we get the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>frequent builds catch problems in code integration;</li>
<li>unit tests are run frequently, catching any regressions;</li>
<li>integration tests are run regularly, catching other problems;</li>
<li>general confidence in the product is increased;</li>
<li>developers are happy to commit changes frequently.</li>
</ul>

May is soon going to have to choose between a soft and a hard Brexit – one that maximises single market access and minimises immigration controls (which the City wants), or the reverse (which a majority of British voters want)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, <a href="/blog/2016/06/25/sixty-three-percent/">as we’ve discussed before</a>, you can’t really argue that a majority of British voters wanted any kind of Brexit. But let’s assume they mean “The majority of those who voted,” which is fair. Even then, you can’t really, fairly, state what it is that those voters wanted, since they were sold a pack of lies, and many voted that way merely as a protest.</p>

			 <p>The other night we watched <cite>Lincoln</cite>, Steven Spielberg’s 2012 film about the US president. It covers just a few months towards the end of the civil war and his life, during the time when he was trying to get the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution</a> through the House of Representatives (the Senate having already passed it). That’s the amendment that outlaws slavery.</p>
<p>It was dramatised, of course.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>But what struck me, and what held resonances with our current situation, was the sheer amount of compromising he had to do.</p>
<p>Then I read an article on <cite>Vox</cite> about Hillary Clinton, which included this:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>
politics, as Clinton never tires of reminding audiences, is about getting real things done for real people.<br>
<footer> —<cite><a href="http://www.vox.com/a/hillary-clinton-interview/the-gap-listener-leadership-quality">Understanding Hillary, by Ezra Klein</a></cite></footer>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the problem that Labour is having now. Whether it’s Jeremy Corbyn’s fault or that of the MPs not backing him, in Labour’s current position it has no chance of getting into government. And if we don’t get into government we can’t do those “real things” for “real people.”
<p>However, I’m far from being convinced that Owen Smith, even if he were to be elected as leader, would put us in any better a position. As well as being largely unknown in the country, he has what looks a slightly shady past, with his lobbying for Pfizer and speaking against the NHS. Though to be fair he rejects any talk of privatisation now.</p>
<p>Corbyn is constantly criticised for not building bridges, not reaching out to people within the party – even within his cabinet, as I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/19/he-is-not-a-team-player-let-alone-a-team-leader/">linked to the other day</a>. I think it’s fair at this point to say that he is at fault to some degree on the Remain campaign. And I’m certainly unhappy with his call, early on the day after the referendum, for <a href="http://labourlist.org/2016/06/corbyn-article-50-has-to-be-invoked-now/">Article 50 to be invoked immediately</a>. That does strongly suggest that his support of the Remain campaign was only ever half-hearted at best.</p>
<p>But even if that’s all true, it doesn’t mean he is solely or even mainly to blame for the disastrous result of the referendum.</p>
<p>And the ongoing, slow-motion disaster that is besetting the Labour Party is at least as much the fault of the plotters. In particular, their behaviour at Prime Minister’s Questions the other day was disgraceful. Their point – renewing Trident was party policy, so the leader should not be speaking against it – was a valid one, but the floor of the House of Commons during the most important event of the parliamentary week, is not the place to argue about it.</p>
<p>The idea of Britain still being a nuclear power, and the doctrine of deterrence, are even more ludicrous now than they were during the 80s when I was a member of CND. But like I say, there’s a time and a place to have that argument, and it’s the party conference.</p>
<p>Maya Goodfellow has a great piece about it all in <cite>The Guardian</cite>:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>
The coup itself is unique in recent times, but Labour’s navel gazing is not.<br>
…<br>
The tribalism that grasps the Labour party is part of its problem. There’s an idea among lifelong supporters and MPs that you’re born Labour, you call the party your own and you will never leave it. This makes some sense – these are people whose families for generations have been Labour members, who spend their weekends canvassing and invest all their spare time, emotional energy and money into the party. They want to feel they have control over it.<br>
…<br>
But it [the tribalism] is also partly responsible for the current divisions. The people who feel entitled to call the party their own have competing viewpoints; some of them want to see a leftward shift and others range from wanting Miliband 2.0 to the rebirth of Blairism.<br>
…<br>
The idea too often seems to be “Vote for Labour because we aren’t the Tories”.<br>
…<br>
Instead of slinging insults at opponents or branding them all Blairites, Corbyn supporters would do better to focus on the task at hand – winning a future general election.<br>
<footer> —<cite><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/22/corbyn-labour-crisis-politics-tribalism-winning-elections">When will Labour’s tribal warfare come to an end?</a></cite></footer>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That idea of the divisions on the left go further than just the Labour party. I thought it was well summed up by this banner that I saw on the Palestine Solidarity march two years ago:
<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px" title="Banner on march" src="https://devilgate.org/uploads/2023/img-2826.jpg" alt="March with banner showing 'CPGB-ML Communist Pary of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist)'" width="300" height="250" border="2">
<p>“Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist),” it says. You can just feel the layers of splits down the years that have led it to such an unwieldy name. Splits on the left are far from new. It’s an old criticism that we spend more time fighting among ourselves than fighting the real enemies.</p>
<p>Or in this case, than working out how to get back into power. Because going back to Lincoln<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and his compromises, to Hillary and her desire to get things done: it’s all for nothing if we don’t get a Labour government into power.</p>
<p>The problem is that Corbyn is “unelectable.” Is he? I’m not sure we know that. He’s sometimes compared to Michael Foot, who famously failed to win an election. But things are very different today from how they were in the eighties. It won’t be easy, but a Labour Party that got fully behind a left-wing leader might well be in a position to win power in 2020, when the next election is due. Or sooner, if May goes to the country over Brexit or otherwise.</p>
<p>In the end I wonder if Corbyn’s biggest problem isn’t just handling the Media. Maybe he needs an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alistair Campbell</a> figure (or hell, why not: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Tucker">Malcolm Tucker</a> one). Does he even <em>have</em> a press secretary or Director of Communications?</p>
<p>All of this leaves me not knowing how to vote in the new leadership election. My heart is with Corbyn, as most of his policies <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/09/09/leadership/">match my own principles</a>. But if the MPs won’t get behind him again, then we’ll be right back where we are now, with the party not providing a useful opposition, and with no likelihood of electoral success.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Owen Smith, on the other hand, seems more likely to fight for us to remain in the EU. But can we trust him?</p>
<p>And either way, what will it do to the party as a whole? A party divided against itself, or worse, a party split in two, has no chance of forming a government.</p></p>

			 <html><body><p>It’s been a strange few weeks.
<p>There was the referendum, and its <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/06/25/sixty-three-percent/">immediate aftermath</a>. That’s still ongoing, of course, and won’t be over any time soon.</p>
<p>Then there was my leaving do from work, as I’d reached the end of the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/05/18/relaunch/">at-risk period</a>, and am now redundant, obsolete, out of work, etc. The do was good. We had a decent turnout of current and former colleagues. My boss’s boss’s boss, the one who told us the news that we were being made redundant, turned up (he is the only one of the hierarchy who is based in Britain, the intervening layers being in Manila) and paid off the tab at the time he left, which must have been about 7pm. We still managed to spend just over £250 after that, which was optimal, as there were five of us.</p>
<p>I got an Uber home, and accidentally discovered what the difference between “Pool” and “UberX” is. I found myself in a car with four strangers (including the driver). To be honest I don’t think “Pool” was an option when I last used an Uber. I assume the “X” means “Exclusive.”</p>
<p>Anyway, they were all going to Islington, which left me to snooze on to Hackney, so it worked out fine.</p>
<p>And then I was unemployed. It didn’t quite hit me at first, because my beloved and I had a weekend trip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avebury">Avebury</a>, which was fascinating. Here’s a picture of some stones. And a sheep.</p>
<img src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/AveburyCoveAndSheep.jpg" alt="AveburyCoveAndSheep" title="AveburyCoveAndSheep.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="400" style="float:right;">
<p>But Monday dawned, and I set to with my new daily plan:</p>
</p><ul>
<li>8:00 – Get up, go for a swim.</li>
<li>9:00-ish – Home, breakfast.</li>
<li>9:30-12:30 – Job-hunt things.</li>
<li>12:30-1:30 – Lunch.</li>
<li>1:30-5:00-ish – Side projects (indie dev/writing).</li>
</ul>
<p>As you might imagine, I haven’t exactly been sticking to that 100%. But the idea is that it’s going to be important to have some structure to my day now that I don’t have one imposed by full-time employment. And job-hunting can be very time-consuming, so treating that as my job for at least part of each day seems like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The first day was strange, because I kept having this sense at the back of my mind, “I’m working from home today, so I’ll be in the office tomorrow,” which would have been true on Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons for the last few years. But then of course it would hit me: no office; no job.</p>
<p>I’m enjoying the experience, though, so far at least. I’ve managed to do pretty well with the schedule, and even extended the swimming to using the gym at the local leisure centre. This is the first time I’ve ever used a gym, except for a few years ago when I had physio after <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2004/06/11/post-election-injury-report/">injuring my leg</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The guy who did my induction managed to hide his disbelief of this fact quite well. And now that I’ve done a few sessions I’m thinking, “Why didn’t I do this years ago?” Oh well.</p>
<p>So all in all, a time of change and newness &ndash; which would generally be good, and some of it is. But see the first point, above, and the debris from that. An unknown new Tory government who don’t seem to be quite willing to accept that parliament is sovereign, and so <em>it</em> needs to decide whether or not to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. And Labour too busy tearing itself apart to hold the government to account.</p>
<p>As to the Labour leadership business, I’ll have more to say about that when I’ve worked out what I think.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>As I vacillate on the Labour leadership business, and try to decide what's best for party and country, I keep coming upon things that increase my feeling that Corbyn might not be the right one for the job.

			 <html><body><p>I am <em>so</em> not a gamer.
<p>Oh, I loved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">Asteroids</a> back in the day. I solved <a href="http://www.monumentvalleygame.com">Monument Valley</a>, and I got on fine with <a href="http://altosadventure.com">Alto&rsquo;s Adventure</a>. But I&rsquo;ve never got more sophisticated modern games. There&rsquo;s a whole big post about that that I&rsquo;ll maybe write one day.</p>
<p>But Pokémon Go has lit up the internet for the last week or so, and it sounded kind of fun. So I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try. Probably more healthy than arguing about the Labour leadership crisis on Facebook, anyway.</p>
<p>I was just out at the shops, and I remembered I had it, and sure enough, there was a wild Golbat outside the local supermarket. You&rsquo;ve got to throw the pokéball to catch them, right? I&rsquo;ve seen enough of the TV series with my kids to get that.</p>
<img src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_4686.jpg" alt="A hovering Golbat superimposed on a shop called 'Local Supermarket'." title="Golbat Outside the Local Supermarket" border="0" width="337" height="600" style="float:right;">
<p>But could I catch it? Could I buggery. No matter how many times I flicked up on the screen to send the ball towards it, it just would not connect. I must have tried like fifty times, standing outside the shop like an idiot.</p>
<p>This is why I never get into games. I soon hit upon something frustrating and get bored with them. No doubt I was doing something wrong. I&rsquo;ll try again, I suppose, but it&rsquo;s very discouraging.</p>
<p>Oh, <em>and</em> I couldn&rsquo;t get the name I wanted. &ldquo;Devilgate&rdquo; was taken, but so was it along with just about every suffix I could think of, including just random strings of numbers.</p>
<p>Kind of cool to see the pokéball rolling off under the vegetable racks, though.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>OK, so why did no-one tell me that Jonathan Richman -- of whom I am, or used to be, a fan -- released a song back in 1992 or so, called “Velvet Underground”? I’ve been a fan of them since <em>long</em> before it was cool, as you know.[^fn1]
<p>OK, so though Jonathan wrote the mighty “Roadrunner” (and apparently was called by some, “The Godfather of Punk”, though I thought that was Iggy), he later moved to a much more mellow, quieter sound.

<p>But anyway, it turns out that there’s this song about the Velvet Underground, which is cool as fuck, as you might expect. Jonathan, of course, has been associated with the Velvets since the early days, roadieing for them and whatnot. So who better to write a song that tries to evoke the startling, shocking effect they had on people, on the music scene, back in 1966 or so?</p>
<p>Here’s his description of John Cale in action:</p>

  A spooky tone on a Fender bass<br>
  Played less notes and left more space<br>
  Stayed kind of still, looked kinda shy<br>
  Kinda far away, kinda dignified

			 <html><body><p>This is an infuriatingly brilliant book. Or brilliantly infuriating. It’s about the tensions between magic and science in a world where both exist. The characters are great and annoying (which only adds to their greatness). The scientists don’t think of investigating magic scientifically, even when a witch helps them rescue someone from an experiment gone wrong, which is annoying. But not very, because it’s so lovely. I predict it will win awards.</p>

			 <html><body><h2>Future</h2>
<p>Yesterday was the strangest day.</p>
<p>Anger, of course. Sadness. And confusion: how could this happen? <em>Why</em> did it happen?</p>
<p>What the hell is wrong with people?</p>
<p>But above all an overwhelming sense of <em>change</em>. Of <em>everything</em> having changed, and not in a good way.</p>
<p>I went out for a walk at lunchtime, and it all felt so strange. What it felt like was that the <em>future</em> had changed.</p>
<p>I know that sounds odd: how can the future change when it hasn’t happened yet? But that&rsquo;s exactly how it felt. Like some time-meddler had taken the future and given it a twist, so that it was off by forty-five degrees or so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m constantly thinking about the future normally, but I guess we just have a kind of background-hum sense of where things are going, and that hum stopped in the early hours of Friday, or changed frequency.</p>
<h2>Sums</h2>
<p>Enough of the metaphors and similes. I did some basic arithmetic. On a turnout of 72%, 52% voted to have the UK leave the EU.  That means 37% of the electorate voted to leave the EU.</p>
<p>Which means 63% of the electorate did not choose to leave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that you can&rsquo;t really assume the desires of the non-voters. But my thinking is  that the decision to leave the EU is tantamount to a constitutional change. I don&rsquo;t know what rules countries with written constitutions have regarding amendments, but my guess is that they will have a higher bar than a simple majority of the turnout. A two-thirds majority, or a majority of the electorate at least, I would expect and hope.</p>
<p>I had this conversation on <cite>The Guardian</cite> site yesterday, wherein the people I was discussing with were saying in effect, &ldquo;You knew the rules when you went in.&rdquo; Which is true enough, but unhelpful. My real point is that the rules should have been different. Now we, the voting public, obviously were not paying close enough attention back in 2015 when the legislation for the referendum was passed. But we have representative democracy, and our representatives &ndash; our MPs &ndash; should have been on top of this. The referendum should never have been brought with such a low threshold allowed for leave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that Cameron  himself didn&rsquo;t ensure that it was hard to leave. Maybe he was a secret Brexiteer.</p>
<p>Or maybe he just didn&rsquo;t believe that the public would ever actually vote to leave. I think with hindsight that that&rsquo;s where I was: in my heart of hearts I couldn&rsquo;t believe that this would happen. And that is probably the root of the cognitive dissonance I felt yesterday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late now, of course. There&rsquo;s not much we can do (though there is <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215?utm_campaign=digest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=app">this petition</a>, which has enough signatures already for parliament to consider it). I wonder if someone could mount some sort of legal challenge, maybe get a judicial review.</p>
<p>Because from where I&rsquo;m sitting <strong>63% of the UK electorate</strong> are about to be dragged out of the European Union without asking for it (or having actively stated their opposition). And that&rsquo;s not even to mention the people who aren&rsquo;t in the electorate, who will be most affected of all. My fifteen-year old daughter came home fuming yesterday; her whole school was in turmoil over this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re failing a whole generation if they see possibilities being closed off before they&rsquo;re even old enough to to vote.</body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>A few more thoughts to follow on from <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/06/22/referendum-thoughts/">last night's post</a>:
</p><h2>Turnout</h2>
<p>Turnout is crucial. If the majority is narrow, and especially if the turnout is low, the losing side will have a very hard time accepting the result.</p>
<p>For example, imagine if the vote goes 55% for Leave, and the turnout is only 60%. That means that only 33% of the electorate has said they want to leave. 27% would have expressly said they don&rsquo;t want to leave, and 40% abstained.</p>
<p>But abstention can &ndash; and in my view should &ndash; be considered as being happy with the status quo. Yes, you can argue that it means that the abstainers are happy to go with the will of the majority of voters, but for such  a major change &ndash; effectively a constitutional change &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a safe assumption</p>
<p>So there ought to have been a requirement for a minimum turnout, and/or a majority of the electorate. In fact, for something this major, I&rsquo;m inclined to think that a mandate to leave should require something like a two-thirds majority &ndash; of the electorate, not just of the turnout.</p>
<p>Something like that was the case in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_devolution_referendum,_1979">original Scottish independence referendum</a> &ndash; approval had to be by 40% of the electorate, not just a simple majority &ndash; though not in he 2014 one. I have criticised that fact in the past, but thinking about it now it seems right.</p>
<h2>Parliament</h2>
<p>Of course, this referendum will not be binding on parliament. If it goes to Leave, it&rsquo;s possible that a majority of MPs could vote against the legislation that would have to be enacted to start the actual departure. That would have <em>interesting</em> results.</p>
<p>And if the majority is very slim in either direction, there will be calls for another referendum. Whatever happens on Thursday, we won&rsquo;t have heard the last of this for a long, long time.</body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>I have, of course, been meaning to write about the referendum almost since it was called. And let’s go right back to that point: of it being called, and why it was, and whether it should have been.
<p>It was called, as anyone can tell, because David Cameron wanted to finally end the feuding in his party over Europe. The Tory party has been at loggerheads about it for decades. I have never known a time when they weren’t fighting about it.</p>
<p>So Cameron promised a referendum, thinking that if they were elected he could lance the boil, as they say. In fact what has happened in the end is that the boil has grown alarmingly, become infected, and is poisoning  its host.</p>
<p>But we shouldn’t gloat. The Tory party in its death throes could take a lot of good things down with it.</p>
<p>I read one piece recently that suggested that he didn’t actually <em>want</em> to do this. That he made the promise fully expecting a hung parliament in 2015, and then he’d be able to say that coalition partners had insisted on no referendum.</p>
<p>Which may well be true, but it doesn’t help us where we are now.</p>
<p>The poison has spread into the body politic of the whole nation, and we are all in danger of becoming infected.</p>
<p>Or am I stretching this metaphor too far?</p>
<p>So much for that. The decision we make on Thursday <em>matters</em>, probably more than any visit to the polls in my lifetime. A decision to leave will be irreversible.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Not that I think we would be utterly unable to survive and thrive outside the EU. We&rsquo;d get by.  But we wouldn&rsquo;t be the best we could be, nor in the best position we could be in.</p>
<p>The EU is far from perfect, but so is the Westminster parliament, the Scottish one, and every other democracy.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But above all, if we&rsquo;re inside it, we are able to influence it &ndash; specifically, our democratically-elected representatives can &ndash; but if we&rsquo;re outside, all we can do is look in.</p>
<p>While having to abide by its oh-so-terribly-onerous regulations if we want to trade with it.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p><cite>The Guardian</cite>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-referendum-keep-connected-and-inclusive-not-angry-and-isolated?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">editorial today</a> advises us to “keep connected and inclusive, not angry and isolated,” and I think we can all get behind that, surely?</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t let me hear any of that “both sides as bad as each other” nonsense. The Remain<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> campaign has been lucklustre, certainly, and I’d have liked to see more dynamism from Jeremy Corbyn and the rest of the Labour leadership &ndash; if only to reduce the impression that it was all about Tory infighting, or that anyone should vote Leave because Cameron wants the opposite. But lacklustre does not equate to vicious, poisonous, and lying.</p>
<p>“Project Fear,” they called it. I even heard one of my colleagues accuse the Remain campaign of fearmongering. But fear is not being “mongered” when we have a <a href="https://medium.com/@ChrisBrosnahan/im-fucking-terrified-7057458c704#.3prt6v5ay">genuinely scary situation</a>.</p>
<p>To end on a more cheerful note, if you only watch one video about the matter, make it this one from John Oliver:</p>

<p>Well, Conceivably we could, at some time in the future, petition to rejoin;  but if we did do that, it would be on quite different terms from those that we&rsquo;re on at present.

			 <p>Some books take weeks or even months to read. Others slip down in just  a few days. This was the latter kind.</p>
<p>Paul Cornell’s <cite>Shadow Police</cite> series is part of a thriving subgenre now. He and Ben Aaronovitch started out at a similar time, I guess, and they’re friends, so I don’t know if they came up with the idea together, or what. Maybe it was just steam-train time. But London cops who deal with the magical, occult side of the city’s problems are very much of today.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This latest volume picks up not long after <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/10/12/the-severed-streets-by-paul-cornell-books-2014-8/"><cite>The Severed Streets</cite></a> finished, and our characters are in some dark places personally and professionally. But then the ghost of Sherlock Holmes is found murdered at the Holmes museum, and a serial killer starts murdering people in ways inspired by the Holmes stories. The game is afoot, obviously, and our heroes must take part.</p>
<p>This is really, really, good, and highly recommended. Though if you haven’t read them yet, start at the beginning with <cite>London Falling</cite>.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I enjoyed it, but I didn't really understand it.
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I should have more to say about it than that, but really, that sums it up quite neatly.</p>
<p>But to try to go a bit deeper&hellip; The solar system is populated by various species or clans of posthumans, transhumans, AIs, uploaded minds, whatever. Earth is unrecognisable, though some people &ndash; seemingly fairly close to basic-human, though it&rsquo;s hard to judge, with so many strangenesses &ndash; still live there.</p>
<p>In some ways the biggest problems with this book, and its predecessor <cite>The Quantum Thief</cite>, which I read a few years ago, is the sheer number of new or repurposed words. None of these is ever explained: you have to gain an understanding of them from context, working it out as you go along.  This is a perfectly fine and valid method of storytelling, but here it all just gets a bit too much.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s my fault for the way I read the book: in disjointed fragments and sections, over weeks. Perhaps if I had read it in a more concentrated fashion, its meanings would have unwrapped themselves for me more easily, more thoroughly.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it&rsquo;s the storyteller&rsquo;s job to tell their story in a way that allows the reader to grasp it, to understand it. If he reader has difficulty with that, then it&rsquo;s not the <em>reader&rsquo;s</em> fault. It&rsquo;s the storyteller&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And yet, and yet, I enjoyed it, I finished it, I think i&rsquo;l probably read the third in the trilogy, which I believe is a thing. Eventually, after some time has passed on this one,</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll probably have just as much trouble with that one when the time comes.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>If you pay attention to URLs and such -- and if you're reading this at all -- you'll be aware that my blog is not sited at the root or home page of the <code>devilgate.org</code> site, but at <code>devilgate.org/blog/</code>. For a long time the <a href="http://devilgate.org/">home page</a> has been a very basic one, with just a few links to the other places you can find me online.
<p>As of today, it still contains those links, but is a slightly more modern, sophisticated page, and has a new focus.</p>
<p>That new focus is job-hunting. I&rsquo;ve been working at Misys for more years than I care to think about &ndash; well,  Misys and one of its precursor companies, BIS, that it bought up in the 90s. And this is the first time I&rsquo;ve named it in public on the internet.</p>
<p>The reasons I never named it before are to do with keeping work and the rest of my life separate; and more to do with the fact that, as quite an elderly tech company, it didn&rsquo;t really have any concept of its staff having an online life outside of it &ndash; or even inside of it. At least until the last couple of years, when it launched a Twitter account and a YouTube channel&hellip; and the less said about them the better.</p>
<p>The same agedness is part of the reason why I have never contributed significantly to any open-source projects: my contract effectively disallowed it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m making it public now &ndash; and I&rsquo;m relaunching my front page &ndash; because I&rsquo;m not going to be working there much longer.</p>
<p>Even in the teen years of the 21st century, we are not past the time of jobs being moved offshore, it seems. Well some jobs, at least; and Misys have been moving development jobs to our &ndash; to their, as I should learn to say &ndash; offices in Manila and Bangalore for years. It was only a matter of time, really.</p>
<p>So about three weeks ago, me and the four other remaining developers in the team were told that we would be leaving at the end of June.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> It wasn&rsquo;t a shock, or even a surprise. In fact, I think we were all fairly pleased, in the end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been expecting it for at least a year, since the last of the developers in another team were sent on their way. To the extent that I&rsquo;ve been looking around, have been for a couple of interviews; because I didn&rsquo;t want to be just hanging on there for the redundancy money. That would be a terrible reason for staying. And while the work was still OK, I didn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to find a job, so I felt I was in a position of strength.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I&rsquo;m quite pleased that none of those opportunities came to anything, because I do get the redundancy money. And <a href="http://devilgate.org/career/MartinMcCallionCV.pdf">my CV</a> is up to date, and my <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/martinmccallion">LinkedIn</a> and more importantly <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/cv/martinmccallion">Stack Overflow</a> profiles are looking reasonably good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m treating this as an opportunity: I&rsquo;m keen to learn new things, have new experiences, and hopefully work in a development environment with releases more than twice a year, and with end-users I actually get to talk to.</p>
<p>So things are OK, but I <em>am</em> looking for a new job. So if you happen to know of anyone who&rsquo;s looking for a Senior Software Engineer, or Lead Programmer, or similar, with a lot of experience in Java and various other languages (and who is currently learning <a href="https://developer.Apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html">Swift</a>), then send them my way.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mind being public about all this now, because I fully expect any company I work for in the future to have a more open, progressive attitude to its employees being citizens of the net.</p>
<p>Well, unless Apple are recruiting.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>And it's like having a new machine.
<p>I have a 13-inch MacBook Pro, mid 2010 model. I bought it in about September or October 2010. Which means it&rsquo;s getting quite long in the tooth. The MacBooks have come on a long way in what they offer since then. Mine had 4GB of memory and a 320 GB hard drive. Nowadays they have solid-state drives by default and start from 16GB of memory, I think.</p>
<p>Thing is, it was still fine in most ways, but it was getting very, very slow. It wasn&rsquo;t too bad once everything was up and running, but waking it from sleep meant I&rsquo;d be seeing what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_(musician)">Ginger out of The Wildhearts</a> called the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWsSTBgfYmU">spinning fucking rainbow</a>&rdquo; (and everyone else calls the beachball) for a <em>long</em> time.</p>
<p>Even when it was up, just switching apps could trigger the slowness. So I was thinking about upgrading. But I figured there was life in the old beast yet. I took <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/10/new-life-an-old-macbook-pro/">inspiration from Jason Snell</a> who writes of upgrading a 2009 model.</p>
<p>According to Apple, the most memory this model can support is 8GB. But according to <a href="http://macsales.com/">Other World Computing</a>, this particular model, though no others from around then, can actually take more &ndash; up to 16GB.</p>
<p>I went to <a href="http://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en">Crucial</a>, which is noted as the best site for Mac upgrades in the UK (OWC is only in the US). Its tool said it could only take 8GB. But I looked around various forums and decided that there was enough evidence that OWC were right. Plus memory is so cheap these days that the difference in price between 8 and 16 was very small.</p>
<p>So I took a chance and ordered 16GB, plus a 500GB SSD.</p>
<p>Installing the memory was trivially easy. You don&rsquo;t need more than a small Phillips screwdriver to open the case, and the memory modules themselves pop out and slot in very easily.</p>
<p>But with the two 8GB modules in, it wouldn&rsquo;t boot up. I just got  series of three beeps, repeated every few seconds.</p>
<p>A bit of googling told me that means &ldquo;bad memory,&rdquo; essentially.</p>
<p>I tried taking it out an putting it back in, swapping round which module was in which slot, and so on, but to no avail. I put the old memory back just to check that I hadn&rsquo;t damaged  something, and it started up like before.</p>
<p>So it looked like OWC were wrong, and I was restricted to 8GB. I was considering sending the memory back to Crucial and hoping I could get I refund. But then I tried one more thing. One of the new 8GB sticks along with one of the old 2GB ones.</p>
<p>And it booted up, smooth as a cliche.</p>
<p>Of course I tried swapping out one 8GB stick for the other, to check for the possibility that one of them actually was bad. But both of them worked. So it seems that this MacBook can take more than 8GB, but not as much as 16. Which is strange, but never mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to say, though, that the difference in performance wasn&rsquo;t obvious. But I didn&rsquo;t spend  lot of time with it like that, because I still had the SSD to install. That&rsquo;s very slightly more involved, needing as it does a Torx screwdriver. But it&rsquo;s very easy.</p>
<p>Before all that I had made sure my old hard drive was thoroughly backed up, you won&rsquo;t be surprised to hear.</p>
<p>I booted up in the new configuration and told the Mac to set itself up as a new installation. It downloaded El Capitan over the air and installed away.</p>
<p>There was one slight glitch in this process. Something went wrong with the installation and I started getting a kernel panic on bootup. I don&rsquo;t quite recall the details now, but I just reformatted the SSD and installed again, and it all went fine.</p>
<p>And the difference&hellip; The difference is <em>astonishing</em>. Even with many apps open (I currently have twelve), and a whole stack of tabs in Safari, using it is <em>effortless</em>. Apps switch without the slightest lag. I can start anything up with only a few bounces. I&rsquo;ve hardly even <em>seen</em> the rainbow.</p>
<p>Even Lightroom, which is the heaviest-weight app I use on here, starts in under ten seconds.</p>
<p>In short, this is the way a computer should be.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>You'll have noticed, I'm sure, that after my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/06/23/the-phantom-menace/">brief</a> comments on the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/10/28/attack-of-the-clowns-or-send-in-the-clones/">three</a> <cite>Star Wars</cite> <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/12/16/revenge-of-the-prequels/">prequels</a> late last year, I didn't come back and say what I thought of the sequel. Which was, after all, the main reason I watched the prequels in the first place.
<p>That was lax of me, but in honour of the DVD of <cite>The Force Awakens</cite> having arrived, here we go now. I won&rsquo;t go into much detail, though: many pixels, and hours of podcasts, have been generated discussing this movie, and the internet doesn&rsquo;t need mine at this late stage. But I&rsquo;ll just quote what I wrote privately after seeing it the first time:</p>
</p><blockquote>
  <cite>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</cite>: I loved every moment, every frame from the scroll onwards. No, before that: from the logo appearing on screen.
<p>Hell, I think &ldquo;A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away&hellip;&rdquo; comes first.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a <em>flawless</em> movie. OK, exaggeration: but it is a wonderful, masterful piece of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other thing I thought was, &ldquo;Move over <cite>Empire</cite>: there&rsquo;s a new best <cite>Star Wars</cite> film.&quot;</body></html></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really good. Every bit as good as the review suggested &ndash; if not quite as good as the blurb suggested.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say much more about it, as almost anything would be spoilers. A time-travel love story. Totes excellent.</p>

			 <html><body><p>A rereading, this, but I remembered much less of it than I thought, and enjoyed it even more than I expected to.
<p>All I really remembered in any detail was the dog-like pack-based beings, the Tines. Maybe a vague sense of the rogue superintelligent AI that caused all the problems.</p>
<p>And the &ldquo;Zones of Thought&rdquo; themselves, of course. A genius idea, which, in brief summary, is this: the further out from the galactic core you get, the more advanced the technology that is possible. Implicitly that includes biology. It&rsquo;s never explicitly stated, but it seems likely that deep inside the galaxy, in the &ldquo;Unthinking Depths,&rdquo; intelligence is not possible. Further out you get the &ldquo;Slow Zone&rdquo;, which is where Earth is.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Only sub-lightspeed travel is possible here, and machines cannot become intelligent.</p>
<p>But all this changes when you get to the galactic fringes, or the &ldquo;Beyond,&rdquo; where FTL and something close to AI are commonplace. And the further up the Beyond you go, the more this is true, until you reach the &ldquo;Transcend,&rdquo; where godlike AIs exist.</p>
<p>My memory was that the sections with the Tines were kind of annoying,  with a sense of, &ldquo;I want my space operas to be set in <em>space</em>, with high tech; not on a mediaeval-level world with nothing more advanced than cartwheels.&quot;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But of course the story of the kids stranded on the Tines' World are both fundamental to the overall story, and at least as good as the galaxy-spanning main plot.</p>
<p>This book has gone from new, Hugo- &amp; Nebula-Award winner to SF Masterwork in what feels like a very short time. It was first published in 1991, which is 25 years ago. I suppose that&rsquo;s enough time to become a classic.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The accolades are thoroughly deserved, of course.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.sfgateway.com/index.php/masterworks-spotlight-a-fire-upon-the-deep/">SF Masterworks edition</a> has an introduction by Ken McLeod, which is well worth reading, and the whole is highly recommended by me.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I read this about a month and a half ago, and already it has slipped quite far from my memory. That's not a good sign, is it?
<p>I&rsquo;m also <em>almost</em> sure I wrote about it already, but it seems not. I certainly can&rsquo;t find anything on either my Mac or iPhone.</p>
<p>But never mind. It&rsquo;s Stross and Doctorow. What&rsquo;s not to like? It&rsquo;s also, I think, something of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fix-up">fix-up</a>. I certainly felt that I had read the early part of it before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a near-future, post-<a href="">singularity</a> world, where our hero, Huw, wakes up with a hangover to find that he has been invited to do jury duty. But rather than determine the guilt or innocence of alleged criminals, this jury&rsquo;s job is to determine the desirability of a piece of new technology.</p>
<p>Huw is a singularity refusenik, who wants to remain on Earth as a baseline human, rather than take advantage of the ability to upload his personality and live forever in the orbital cloud. The jury&rsquo;s job is to assess whether a piece of new tech should be allowed to come back from the cloud to Earth.</p>
<p>At least, that&rsquo;s the theory. It goes a long way from there, as you might expect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, but as I suggested above, not that memorable. On the other hand, that could just be my memory.</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Nothing to do with stigmata, really, and the titular differences aren't even mentioned until three-quarters of the way through the book. It's almost as if Dick wanted to use the title, and then realised, "Oh, I haven't said what these stigmata are yet, or why. Better throw them in." Because they are also entirely irrelevant to the story.
<p>Oh yes, the story. Hmm. It&rsquo;s not one of Dick&rsquo;s best, and a lot of it barely makes sense. Or at least, it makes sense in that it&rsquo;s internally consistent. But it&rsquo;s hard to believe. The UN conscripts people using a military-style draft, to go and live on the colonies &ndash; Mars is the only one we see, but several other planets and moons within the solar system are implied.</p>
<p>Colonists' lives are so hard and unpleasant that the only way they can get by &ndash; and the only entertainment they have, it seems &ndash; is to lose themselves in shared hallucinations induced by a drug called Can-D, during which they enter the world of characters called Perky Pat and her boyfriend Walt. These are inspired or induced using &ldquo;layouts&rdquo; &ndash; groupings of miniaturised artefacts that become part of Pat&rsquo;s life, and hence of the colonists' hallucinations.</p>
<p>In any group entering the shared experience, all the women always take the part of Pat, and all the men that of Walt. Which seems very limiting and heteronormative.</p>
<p>And, oh, yes, the sexual politics.</p>
<p>In some ways they&rsquo;re not too bad. The main character, Barney Mayerson, is a precog &ndash; oh yes, we have those, too, except when we forget that we do &ndash; and his assistant, Roni Fugate, ends up with his job, which is a quite a senior one at the company that makes &ldquo;mins&rdquo; &ndash; miniaturised items for use with the Perky Pat layouts. They use their precognitive powers to know what items are going to be fashionable. Other than that, the existence of reliable precognition seems to have had no impact on society.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why he wrote &ldquo;Minority Report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyway, at the start, she is also his lover, which seems to have happened as soon as she started working with him, almost as a given.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a significant part of the plot is driven by the fact that he has never got over his breakup with his wife &ndash; which I think might have been as long as twenty years ago &ndash; whom he dumped because she was bad for his career, or something.</p>
<p>In fact she&rsquo;s a highly skilled potter, who makes artefacts that are miniaturised for use in these famous layouts. Mayerson rejects her latest designs, saying they won&rsquo;t be successful, when Roni says they will. His attempt to screw up his ex&rsquo;s career leads her (and her new husband, who is acting as her salesman) into the arms of a rival corporation.</p>
<p>That body has been set up by the mysterious titular character. Palmer Eldritch has just returned from a ten-year trip to the Proxima system, whence he might have bought back a new drug, Chew-Z, that has similar properties to Can-D but is even more powerful.</p>
<p>Also global warming: the world is unliveably hot, so everyone stays in air-conditioned buildings (and makes things worse). In America, at least. We don&rsquo;t hear anything about the rest of the world. And forced &ldquo;evolution&rdquo;: some people go for expensive treatments in Swiss clinics, which give them bigger brains and leathery skin, at least on their head. Though sometimes it goes wrong and their intelligence decreases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all quite, quite mad, and the conclusion probably makes even less sense. But what the hell, it&rsquo;s fun enough while it lasts.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>This set of short stories admirably shows why Miéville's work has been called "weird fiction." Most of these are very strange indeed.
<p>In some of them, though, the strangeness feels like incompleteness. They should be longer, go into more detail, or just have an ending. Several of the pieces are less true stories than vignettes, scenes. Not itself a bad thing, but it slightly belies the subtitle.</p>
<p>None of which to say I didn&rsquo;t enjoy this. I very much did. Still, I think he&rsquo;s stronger as a novelist than as a short-story writer.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Well, this is more like it. It's far from perfect, but <cite>Revenge of the Sith</cite> is far and away the best of the three prequels.
<p>And that is largely because it has a story that mostly makes sense, and isn&rsquo;t too confusing. Sure, there are still plot holes, and flaws in the motivation; but overall it holds together pretty well.</p>
<p>Still not as well as any of the original trilogy, of course.</p>
<p>The biggest point that doesn&rsquo;t work for me is that we don&rsquo;t see why Anakin has any connection with Palpatine. He goes over to the latter far too easily. I don&rsquo;t so much mean his falling to the Dark Side; that was on the cards at least since he murdered the Sandpeople in <cite>Clones</cite>. I mean the fact that Palpatine was suddenly asking him to spy on the Jedi Council, while the Council were equally-suddenly talking about his closeness to Palpatine. We had seen none of this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about all this lately, and I gather that much is made clearer in the ancillary material: novels, comics, the <cite>Clone Wars</cite> series that was made around the same time. But even if that is so, it means the movies fail. A movie has to be able to stand on its own. You can&rsquo;t expect the viewer to have read around the subject or watched spinoff series. You can just barely rely on them having seen the immediately-prior films.</p>
<p>Compare and contrast the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for example. You can watch <cite>The Avengers</cite> without having seen any of the prior films. Or enjoy <cite>Agents of SHIELD</cite> without having seen <cite>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</cite>, for example. If you <em>have</em> seen the related material then it enhances the whole. But any element can stand without the others.</p>
<p>The love story between Anakin and Padmé remains unconvincing, and Padmé&rsquo;s death&hellip; well, I had gained the impression that she had died in childbirth, which seemed implausible in such a technologically-advanced society. In fact she died of a broken heart, or just gave up the ghost, or something. Which would be more plausible (if still not very) had she not just given birth. It seems more likely that a new mother would tend to fight for life to protect her babies. She died because the plot needed her to, in the end. If, as a creator, you have to do that kind of thing, you should at least find a more convincing way to do it.</p>
<p>Anyway, now I&rsquo;ve seen all of the <cite>Star Wars</cite> movies, and I&rsquo;m ready for <cite>The Force Awakens</cite>. Which is good, because I&rsquo;ll be seeing it in about 30 hours.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>We come to the end of what I can now confidently say was my favourite series of new <cite>Doctor Who</cite> so far. No matter how good it was when it all came back with Chris Ecc (as we still like to call him in my family); how much we liked David Tennant; how manically brilliant Matt Smith was from day one: Peter Capaldi was <em>on fire</em> this season, and Stephen Moffat is at the top of his game as showrunner.
<p>Were this last pair as good as &ldquo;The Empty Child&rdquo;/&ldquo;The Doctor Dances&rdquo; or &ldquo;Blink&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s hard to say definitively, because those were so <em>shockingly</em> good when they hit us. But I think in time we&rsquo;ll say so. I don&rsquo;t doubt that Capaldi and the production team will win BAFTAs this year, and I&rsquo;m sure that one of the last two will get the Hugo.</p>
<p>Awards may not mean that much (though let&rsquo;s face it, they do) but when you see an award-worthy performance, or read something that you know is likely to win, that deserves to win &ndash; you know you&rsquo;ve experienced something special.</p>
<p>And we experienced something very special in this season of <cite>Doctor Who</cite> And particularly in the last three episodes.</p>
<p>I just read a foolish comment on a <a href="http://www.tor.com/2015/12/07/why-peter-capaldi-is-the-uber-doctor/">Tor.com post</a> about how great Capaldi is. It said, in effect, &ldquo;That episode was only about the gender &amp; skin-colour switching regeneration.&rdquo; Yes, that was it: it was about that one thing <em>and nothing else</em>.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, that <em>was</em> a nice touch.</p>
<p>One thing I haven&rsquo;t seen or heard mentioned is how <em>terrified</em> the Time Lords were of him &ndash; well, Rassilon, at least: one guy, and they send a vast floating gun platform to bring him in. Of course, it turns out that Rassilon was right to be  afraid.</p>
<p>One thing about this episode and more importantly, <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/12/01/heaven-and-lords/">the previous</a>, seems to be causing people some confusion. The Doctor didn&rsquo;t spend two billion years (or whatever) in the clockwork castle. Two billion years worth of <em>copies</em> of him &ndash; each with some awareness of its past iterations, triggered by the word &ldquo;bird&rdquo; &ndash; go through a near-identical experience.</p>
<p>Though <cite>Hell Bent</cite> proves that even The Doctor &ndash; or Stephen Moffat &ndash; is confused by this.</p>
<p>Mind you, the planet on which the castle is built does experience all that time, we must assume, as The Doctor observes how the stars have changed.</p>
<p>What the episode does do is address the old philosophical question of whether matter transmitters make copies. In the Whoniverse at least, they do.</p>
<p>Unless the whole thing is a simulation, including the changing stars.</p>
<p>Anyway, masterful, glorious work. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the Christmas special.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>It's only twelve years ago. Twelve years, and it feels like everyone -- the bulk of MPs, at least -- has forgotten about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Dossier">dodgy dossier</a>; about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_and_awe">shock &amp; awe</a>; about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse">Abu Ghraib</a> and everything that followed.
<p>Because here we are again: our elected representatives are banging spears on shields and baying with the desire to follow a weak, shoddy prime minister to war.</p>
<p>Classic political distraction, of course: things are bad at home (to say nothing of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/28/inside-the-investigation-that-forced-grant-shapps-to-resign">in the government&rsquo;s party</a>), so let&rsquo;s have a war to distract the populace; the electorate; the &ldquo;patient millions/Who put them into power,&rdquo; as Billy Bragg <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD9Ma3KnOYg">put it</a>.</p>
<p>So far, so unsurprising. But it&rsquo;s Labour MPs who really bother me. I thought perhaps we had turned a corner with the election of Jeremy Corbyn. That maybe we would return to being a proper opposition, by actually opposing Tory excesses. And by doing so, show the nation that here is a true alternative to the politics of the last couple of decades; to right-wing versus slightly-less-right-wing. Show the potential for a more peace-loving Britain.</p>
<p>But here they all are, the party grandees, howling for bombs alongside the Tories. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, of course: it was a Labour government that took us into Iraq twelve years ago. In my defence &ndash; and theirs, to some extent &ndash; we were deceived , then &ndash; them by that dossier, us by them. Millions marched against it,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but many thought that there must be something to all this talk of us being 45-minutes away from an attack. That the government must <em>know something</em>.</p>
<p>Back then my son was nearly six. When we told him &ndash; in an age-appropriate way, as they say &ndash; that it looked like there was going to be a war &ndash; his first response was, &ldquo;Will I have to go away?&rdquo; Those tales of World War II evacuated kids burn deep for a Londoner.</p>
<p>We reassured him that no, the war would be far away, and wouldn&rsquo;t affect us directly. Two years later we were proved wrong, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_July_2005_London_bombings">the war came to his hometown</a>. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>And just two weeks ago the current war came to Paris. Does anyone doubt, if our leaders go ahead and escalate this war, that we&rsquo;ll see it come back to British streets? Maybe London again. Maybe Birmingham, Manchester, Belfast, Glasgow.</p>
<p>More blood on British streets. Blood, which &ndash; along with that of the innocents who die in Syria under RAF bombs &ndash; will be at least partly on the hands of the MPs who go through the division lobbies with the government tomorrow.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I wouldn't have minded if I had guessed it myself. But one little line in the <cite>Guardian Guide</cite> prompted me. All it did was make me think of something I hadn't thought of before, but it felt like a spoiler: "The Doctor comes closer than ever before to returning to Gallifrey," or some such.
<p>And there it was: &ldquo;They&rdquo; from <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/11/28/raven-and-what/">last week</a> had to be the Time Lords.</p>
<p>But why? Why did they do it? Why put the Doctor through that, just to get him to Gallifrey? And also, how? of course: how can he get to Gallifrey when it&rsquo;s supposed to be locked away in some pocket universe?</p>
<p>And titling: why was it called &ldquo;Heaven Sent&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Great episode, by the way. Best of the season. Indeed, I predict a Hugo.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Well. Well, well well.
<p>Well.</p>
<p>I have to say (and spoilers here for &ldquo;Face the Raven&rdquo;, if you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet): that was companion-exit that guarantees they won&rsquo;t be able to bring her back.</p>
<p>OK, yes, nothing is forever in <cite>Doctor Who</cite>, and there are already rumours or suggestions that Clara will be appearing in flashbacks or similar in the next two episodes. But that really felt properly final.</p>
<p>And I have to say, I hope it stays that way. Nothing against Clara, or Jenna Coleman &ndash; I think she was a good companion played by a very good actor &ndash; but it just feels that they&rsquo;ve done too much of bringing companions back. Sure, we all love to see them again, but really? She&rsquo;s gone out with a heroic and tragic last scene. It would cheapen it to bring her back.</p>
<p>Unless there was a very good reason, of course.</p>
<p>It occurs to me: if the planned new spinoff programme, <cite>Class</cite>, is to be set in and around Coal Hill School, where Clara was teaching: what does her death mean for that, for the characters in it? Presumably some of them will be her students, or teachers who knew her.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to Clara, and the Raven. And maybe her death wish?</p>
<p>I was pleased that she mentioned Danny Pink at the end, because I&rsquo;ve been thinking that it was strange that neither she nor The Doctor had mentioned him in this season. It seemed that she really hadn&rsquo;t had a chance go grieve properly &ndash; or hadn&rsquo;t let herself do so.</p>
<p>Though we don&rsquo;t know how long is supposed to have passed. It could be a year, two, since the events of &ldquo;Death in Heaven&rdquo;. Which doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;d have stopped grieving &ndash; certainly not that she&rsquo;d have forgotten him. But she could have got to a place where she could carry on without always thinking of him.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s her mood this series, her mad drive for more adventures, her carelessness &ndash; best shown in this very episode with the way she hung out of the Tardis<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So if we want to psychoanlayse her, we can say that she has spent the last ten episodes (and maybe longer) running away from Danny&rsquo;s death, from her own feelings about it; or running towards her own eventual death, her sacrifice.</p>
<p>This episode for me was one of the best I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time. I was considered quite contentious in my family when I said I thought that the current season was the best of New-Who. That led to much discussion of other past seasons, and my eventual acquiescence into the idea that it&rsquo;s mainly the best because it&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s happening now. Like my friend Paul <a href="http://vadamagazine.com/author/paul-cockburn">said a while back</a>: &ldquo;My favourite episode of <cite>Doctor Who</cite>? The next one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I think the truth of it is that it has been a very <em>even</em> series: not great highs (except maybe this very episode) &ndash; no &ldquo;Blink&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances&rdquo; or &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s Day&rdquo;. But no real lows, either (arguably the previous episode, but I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/11/19/sleep-and-no-raven/">still think it was worthwhile</a>.) An entire season (so far) of solid, strong episodes, leading to a climax like this &ndash; and who knows what will come next?</p>
<p>I note in passing that <a href="http://vadamagazine.com/23/11/2015/television/doctor-who/doctor-who-face-raven-review">this reviewer thinks like me</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway. There is much more I could say &ndash; like who are the &ldquo;they&rdquo; who have kidnapped The Doctor? The obvious answer would be Davros and the Daleks, possibly with help from Missy. That would bookend the season nicely, and make some sense of Ashildr asking for his &ldquo;Confession Dial&rdquo;. But that might be too obvious.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s enough for now. Quoth the Raven, &ldquo;<cite>Neverwhere</cite>&rsquo;s all about hidden London, isn&rsquo;t it?&quot;</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Well, as far as we can tell, this one isn't part one of a two parter. So I guess I should write about it on its own.
<p>I enjoyed it immensely &ndash; well, quite a lot &ndash; but I just wish sometimes they would take the trouble to come up with good, rational explanations for the events. Relatively simple steps, only needing a few extra words &ndash; or different words &ndash; in the script, could make these episodes be so much better.</p>
<p>The critical example of a story like this from last season is &ldquo;<a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/10/07/space-bat-angel-dragons-hatch-in-their-own-way/">Kill the Moon</a>&rdquo;. As I wrote at that link, they could relatively easily have included a few words that would have made the idea less preposterous. It wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be good science, but it would at least be less-ridiculous science than the explanation that was actually given.</p>
<p>So too here, then, with &ldquo;Sleep No More.&rdquo; The atmosphere and style of the episode were great. And the plot was fine. It was just the execution of the plot, including in particular the explanation for the problem, that let it down.</p>
<p>Let me explain what I mean. The plot, in summary, was: In found footage a mad scientist tells us the story of some soldiers investigating a space station that has dropped out of communication. The crew have been turned into dust-zombies by a machine that enables them to function on five minutes sleep a day. The explanation for the dust conversion is stupid.</p>
<p>The Doctor and Clara, of course, have arrived on the station and help to investigate. Clara gets sucked into the sleep machine, which means she will become a dust monster too.</p>
<p>Our heroes and the surviving troops escape in the TARDIS, and the mad scientist reveals he is a dust monster and is spreading the infection via the very recording we&rsquo;re watching.</p>
<p>As I write that I realise that the whole Clara/infection thing wasn&rsquo;t resolved, and nor, of course, was the infection via radio business (it reminded me slightly of <cite>Snow Crash</cite>, incidentally). So maybe they will revisit it, next week or later.</p>
<p>But the ostensible explanation &ndash; before we got the radio part from the mad scientist &ndash; was that somehow the sleep-compression machine caused the sleep in the corner of your eyes to &ndash; what, grow sentient and consume humans, generating more of itself in the process? It&rsquo;s hard even to explain what they were getting at.</p>
<p>Yet all they had to do was to say it was an alien intelligence that hade got into the mad scientist&rsquo;s head and convinced him that helping it to spread was the right thing. then even have the sleep-machines infecting people via nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The aliens could even be cousin-species of the <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Vashta_Nerada">Vashta Nerada</a>, as there&rsquo;s a certain similarity.</p>
<p>Of course, that way we&rsquo;d lose the radio-transmission-based spread, which was a nice touch too. So maybe nanotech that is quiescent until activated by the code sent in the transmssion.</p>
<p>Either way, it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of thought to come up with an idea that doesn&rsquo;t break the story, but which <em>also</em> doesn&rsquo;t jerk the viewer out of their suspension of disbelief.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t get me started on the <cite>Star Trek</cite>-style powered orbit.</p>
<p>In my family we have concluded that what the show needs is, like UNIT, a Scientific Advisor.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I thought of a couple of alternative titles for this: "Old Enough to be Your Messiah." (I'll bet that played well in parts of America.) "The Basil &amp; Petronella Show." "Who's Gonna Make the Violins?" But for consistency with my other posts. I'm sticking with this.
<p>This was a great pair of episodes. True, some will have found it hard to understand what was going on in the first episode; and true also, the whole Zygon plot might not have entirely made sense (why, in particular, do they have electric zappy powers now, and why does that turn people into sparking wire wool?) But the overall mood, and tone, and writing, were fantastic.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fanservice. The references to Harry Sullivan; the portrait of the first Doctor over the safe; &ldquo;Five Rounds Rapid!&rdquo; (Which, I discover, is the title of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Five-Rounds-Rapid-Autobiography-Brigadier/dp/1852277823">Nicholas Courtney&rsquo;s autobiography</a>.) I Loved it all.</p>
<p>This season feels to me like it&rsquo;s really solid. There are no real highs: no &ldquo;Blink&rdquo;, no &ldquo;The Empty Child&rdquo; or &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s Day&rdquo;. But there have been no really weak episodes yet either.</p>
<p>On second watching I caught an interesting snippet. When the Doctor is telling Zygella why he didn&rsquo;t press the big button, he says he &ldquo;let Clara Oswald get into [his] head.&rdquo; Then he says, &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t leave.&rdquo; Maybe that&rsquo;ll be the big secret reveal of this season: Clara doesn&rsquo;t leave after all.</p>
<p>No, I realise that can&rsquo;t be so, as official BBC announcements have been made. But it was an interesting change from the heavy-handed foreshadowing of her departure that we&rsquo;ve seen. Clara has been the Doctor&rsquo;s &ndash; and our &ndash; companion for a long time now, and it&rsquo;ll be strange for all of us to adjust to someone new.</p>
<p>I loved the Doctor&rsquo;s speech &ndash; soliloquy, you might say &ndash; that reinstated the ceasefire. It&rsquo;s his statement of Doctoriness.</p>
<p>Still wondering if there&rsquo;s a big thing for this season. I mean, apart from Clara leaving. It has to be something to do with hybrids of some kind &ndash; I noticed that the second part didn&rsquo;t use that word, though the first did. The Osgoods could be said to be a hybrid, but I can&rsquo;t see them coming back before the end of this run. There&rsquo;s the Dalek/Time Lord thing, which will have to play out at some point.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the Minister of War &ndash; which could just be a throwaway name like the Nightmare Child; but I think it was placed too specifically for that. And Lady Me, or Ashildr. I fully expect to see her again.</p>
<p>I expect we&rsquo;ll have to wait for the closing two-parter, &ldquo;Heaven Sent&rdquo;/&ldquo;Hell Bent&rdquo; to find out.</p>
<p>But before that we&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;Sleep No More&rdquo; on Saturday. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a two-parter with the one after, &ldquo;Face the Raven&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to finding out.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>The pages, how they turn. I'm sure I've said that before of JK Rowling's work, but not in public, it seems.  Amusing to note that <cite>The Silkworm</cite> <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/10/23/the-silkworm-by-robert-galbraith-books-2014-10/">was my number 10 last year</a>.
<p>Plenty of Robin in this one, and it&rsquo;s probably the best of the three. Certainly better than the last one.</p>
<p>Strangest thing about it is the music. By which I mean: the title is taken from a song by Blue Öyster Cult, and quotes from them precede most of the chapters (some chapters have titles, and those are the titles of BÖC songs).</p>
<p>Now, I had no idea that Patti Smith wrote some lyrics for BÖC, but apparently she did<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Still on a musical note, in passing, one of the ancillary characters roadies for a band who are called Death Cult. Since JK Rowling is about the same age as me, and since she obviously pays attention to music, I would expect her to know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cult">The Cult</a> used to be known as Death Cult, and before that as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Death_Cult">Southern Death Cult</a>. But perhaps you had to read the music papers in the 80s to know about that kind of stuff.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Anyway, the Death Cult here have nothing to do with either the famous Cult, nor the Blue Öyster one.</p>
<p>The ending is a tad unsatisfying, as it leaves a number of things unresolved &ndash; which is fine, as there will no doubt be more books &ndash; and doesn&rsquo;t really give us enough time post-denoument to decompress with the characters.</p>
<p>Still, highly recommended, as long as you&rsquo;re not put off by gruesome scenes.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Out of sequence, but for completeness I should write a piece about the first two-parter in this year's <cite>Doctor Who</cite> series. "The Magician's Apprentice" and "The Witch's Familiar".
<p>Excellent that they managed not to include the word &ldquo;Dalek&rdquo; in the title of a Dalek story. A genuine surprise when the boy in the minefield said his name.</p>
<p>And great, great interplay between Missy and Clara, especially.</p>
<p>But if we assume, as we must, that the Magician is The Doctor and Missy is the Witch , does that make Clara both the Apprentice and the Familar? Or is Davros one of all of the above? It&rsquo;s all very mysterious.</p>
<p>And Dalek/Time Lord hybrids? This can&rsquo;t end well.</p>
<p>Wait, though: following on from <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/10/28/died-and-lived/">my previous</a>: The Doctor isn&rsquo;t the Scarecrow: he&rsquo;s the Wizard. But then, who is behind the curtain?</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Some time in 2002, as I suppose it must have been, I was driving through Hackney with my then-small son in the car, when he said, "Dad,  I saw a clown."
<p>OK, I thought, someone probably dressed up for a kids' party. It was a Saturday, as I recall. &ldquo;Oh, yeah, where?&rdquo; I glanced around, but couldn&rsquo;t see any white faces or red noses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a bus shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clown? On a bus shelter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A clown. You know, from <cite>Star Wars</cite>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guess I must have been able to give some explanation of what &ldquo;clone&rdquo; means, to a five-year-old. But it wasn&rsquo;t till last weekend that we finally saw the relevant movie.</p>
<p>And as <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/06/23/the-phantom-menace/">before</a>&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I&rsquo;ve been led to believe. Keeping your expectations low always helps.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t great, it&rsquo;s true. In particular I wasn&rsquo;t convinced by Anakin and Padmé falling in love. Anakin, yes, but Padmé, really, no.</p>
<p>I had a hard time working out what the sides were in the big battle. The clones end up fighting on the side of the Republic? I didn&rsquo;t expect that.</p>
<p>And this bothers me: if you are an assemblage of planets joined together in common cause by treaty, and some of those planets decide they want to leave &ndash; going to war over it should be the furthest thing from your mind. It would be like if a country wanted to leave the EU, and the rest of the EU formed a vast army to force them to stay in it. That&rsquo;s not the action of a peaceful democratic entity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also <em>insane</em>. Even if you win and make the would-be-leavers stay, you&rsquo;ve now got a load of people &ndash; whole <em>worlds</em> &ndash; who are actively hostile to the grouping they are within. That can&rsquo;t be healthy.</p>
<p>Now, if a subset leaves peacefully, and then war developed later on, that would be more believeable. After all, we acknowledge the EU&rsquo;s effect of helping to keep Europe peaceful these past seventy years. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I am strongly against the idea of Britain leaving.</p>
<p>But most importantly of all: you can&rsquo;t say &ldquo;federation starships&rdquo; and mean the bad guys. I know they were talking about the Trade Federation, but &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_Starfleet_starships_ordered_by_class">federation starship</a>&rdquo; <em>means something</em> in SF, and to hear it used here was really jarring. Did Lucas have beef with Roddenberry, or something?</p>
<p>Yoda fighting was fun. He&rsquo;s so <em>tiny</em>.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve booked a work outing to see Episode VII on the 17th of December, the day it opens.</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Some quick thoughts on the "The Girl Who Died"/"The Woman Who LIved" <cite>Doctor Who</cite> diptych.
<p>It&rsquo;s unusual and intriguing to see what was effectively a two-part story with different writing credits for each part. Yet there was no real need for these two episodes to be shown back-to-back, and indeed I partly got the sense that they might have been stronger if they had been separated by a few other stories.</p>
<p>On the  other hand I&rsquo;m fairly sure that the second part had to happen now because they&rsquo;re gearing up to something. Maisie Williams&rsquo;s Ashildr or &ldquo;Me&rdquo; character is, I feel sure, fundamental to this season&rsquo;s overall story, if it has one.</p>
<p>After the first part I had the idea that Ashildr was going to become &ldquo;The Minister of War&rdquo;, the mysterious figure that was referred to by <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/10/10/lake-and-flood/">O&rsquo;Donnell in &ldquo;Under the Lake&rdquo;</a> as being something that 1980 was before &ndash; along with <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/10/07/space-bat-angel-dragons-hatch-in-their-own-way/">the moon blowing up</a> and Harold Saxon.</p>
<p>Such an ominous-sounding figure  is surely going to be an enemy of The Doctor, and at the end of &ldquo;The Girl Who Died&rdquo; he had created a near immortal who might not be at all happy with him about the situation, and who might use her longevity to gain power.</p>
<p>As indeed was the case, as we saw in &ldquo;The Woman Who Lived&rdquo;. However by the end of the second part I was less sure that Ashildr&rsquo;s future role will be that one. It seems fairly likely that she&rsquo;s going to have one, though, with her promise to pick up the pieces after The Doctor runs away, the giant foreshadowing of Clara&rsquo;s departure, and of course her appearance in the background of Clara&rsquo;s pupil&rsquo;s photo.</p>
<p>However I get the feeling that her intentions will be more benign.</p>
<p>All just wild speculation, of course.</p>
<p>This pair of episodes were probably the weakest of the series so far, but they were still very good. Effective  lightening of the mood with the comedy elements, while still not shying away from the darkness.</p>
<p>One last thought: in the pub scene at the end there were two people at a table in the foreground. I haven&rsquo;t checked yet, but I&rsquo;m fairly sure that the shot was a visual allusion to the <cite>Sandman</cite> episode whose title escapes me,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but in which Death agrees with her brother that she won&rsquo;t take this one guy, and Morpheus meets him in taverns every hundred years. Which would tie in with the immortality theme, of course.</p>
<p>Oh, and: on Jason Snell&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/teevee/106/index.php">Incomparable Flashcast</a> about the second part (which episode Mr Snell wasn&rsquo;t on, but never mind), the alien was likened to an &ldquo;angry Cowardly Lion&rdquo;. Now I&rsquo;m sure there was also a mention by The Doctor of Ashildr&rsquo;s heart &ldquo;rusting&rdquo; or &ldquo;needing lubrication&rdquo;, or some such &ndash; which was surely a reference to the Tin Woodsman. Which makes The Doctor The Scarecrow?</p>
<p>And Clara is Toto, of course, since Missy already likened her to a small dog.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll all make sense eventually.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Well, I'm not quite sure that Toby Whithouse quite managed to make the second episode as good as the first, but I'm loving the new series of <cite>Doctor Who</cite>.
<p>The Beethoven bit at the start was unnecessary: a rare example of the modern show not expecting the viewer to keep up, but assuming they&rsquo;ll need an explanation &ndash; a pre-explanation in this case, but still. (Also breaking the fourth wall; most unusual.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe some people would have been a bit lost at the end without it. Maybe all of us would have missed the point and weeks later we&rsquo;d have gone &ldquo;Wait, but he only did that because he &ndash;&rdquo; Which has its own pleasure too, of course.</p>
<p>My main concern was that The Doctor let O&rsquo;Donnell die, without any apparent remorse. I have a feeling that might come back to haunt him.</p>
<p>Also: loving the two-parters. Proper cliffhangers and all. How about a traditional four-parter next season?</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I feel that we should be rendering the author’s name in the Chinese way, with the family name first: Liu Cixin. That’s how he signs himself in the “Author’s Postscript”, and that’s how the translator renders all the characters’ names. But the above is how the publishers have done it, so we’ll stick with that for now.
<p>As a work in translation, <cite>The Three-Body Problem</cite> fits well within the parameters of <a href="http://tempest.fluidartist.com/non-fiction/the-challenge/">The Tempest Challenge</a>, which, as <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/04/30/neither-tempestuous-nor-particularly-challenging/">I told you</a>, I’m taking this year. It’s also this year’s <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2015-hugo-awards/">Hugo winner</a>, so I was keen to read it for that reason.</p>
<p>Right at the start I felt a mild sense of annoyance, because it was only then that I realised it is part of an incomplete trilogy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I’m not keen on starting unfinished serieses (it is so a word).</p>
<p>I finished it last night with a sense of surprise. According to my Kindle I was only at 85%; more importantly it didn’t exactly <em>feel</em> like the end, though to be fair I wasn’t quite sure where it could go from that point. I knew there were notes from the author and the translator, but they surely couldn’t be that long?</p>
<p>They couldn’t. But it turns out that the digital copy contains an extract from the next book in the series. I’m not sure how I feel about this trend in general. I don’t think I’ve ever read one of them. But I do think they’re getting too damn big: this one was fully 10% of the file, according to the Kindle.
One tenth of a novel is not in fact that novel, but an extract from the next one? I don’t think that’s a great trend.
But to the content. What did I actually think of the work?
Umm&hellip; mixed. I enjoyed it overall, am glad I read it, and will probably read the sequels. But it has problems that I don&rsquo;t think are just caused by my cultural expectations. Though they might be: the translator, Ken Liu, in his postscript says:</p>
</p><blockquote>
  But there are more subtle issues involving literary devices and narration techniques. The Chinese literary tradition shaped and was shaped by its readers, giving rise to different emphases and preferences in fiction compared to what American readers expect. In some cases, I tried to adjust the narrative techniques to ones that American readers are more familiar with. In other cases I've left them alone, believing that it's better to retain the flavour of the original.
</blockquote>
<p>Which is fair enough, and for &ldquo;American&rdquo; it&rsquo;s safe to read &ldquo;British&rdquo;, as well. But perhaps the most important literary technique &ndash; or at least, the admonition most often drummed into beginning writers &ndash; is &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo;. As I have <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/06/09/tell-and-maybe-show-as-well/">argued</a> myself, it&rsquo;s not a rule that can or should be set in stone; but there are times when violating it comes across as clumsy at best.</p>
<p>There are many such times in <cite>The Three-Body Problem</cite>. Long sections of characters' lives are told to us as a history. Similarly with the sections that take place in the &ldquo;Three Body&rdquo; game.</p>
<p>There are some great ideas here; in particular the best use of monomolecular fibres since &ndash; was it &ldquo;Johnny Mnemonic&rdquo;? One of William Gibson&rsquo;s shorts, anyway.
It&rsquo;s also worth reading for the historical parts: the terror of living through China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution is well evoked. But the aliens are hard to believe in.</p>
<p>And part of the initial setup: scientists are killing themselves because things seem to have gone fundmentally wrong with physics. I found that unconvincing. If as a scientist you find things not behaving as you expect &ndash; even seemingly randomly &ndash; you don&rsquo;t give up on science and life; you try to find a new theory to fit the facts.</p>
<p>Lastly, I don&rsquo;t think we ever found out what&rsquo;s supposed to happen at the end of the countdown.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t mean to do a hatchet job. I did enjoy it, and as I say, I&rsquo;ll probably read the sequels. Would it have won the Hugo in a less puppy-infested year? Maybe. You can never tell.</body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>There has been little in the news lately but the refugee crisis and the Labour leadership election. I'm here to talk, briefly, before the polls close on Thursday, about the latter.
<p>I just voted, and guess what? For Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a member of the party before.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I always thought that I was too independent to toe a party line; too many of my anarchist ideals, forged in the fires of punk, still stood.</p>
<p>Well, maybe. But my anarchism, such as it was, was always on the socialist wing. And I recognise the idealism that drove it. I&rsquo;d like to think that humans could live without governments and leaders &ndash; that we are perfectible, and could form a working society through cooperation. But the fact is, of course, that that is not yet the case. And until it is, there are things worth standing up for, worth believing in. Worth fighting for.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to toe a line; but in May we crossed a line. After five years of a Tory government in all but name, we have a named one. David Cameron and his regime will go down in history as worse than Thatcher&rsquo;s; but until he does go down, we have to deal with the effects of it.</p>
<p>On the morning after the election I resolved to join the Labour party and do what I could to help. This wasn&rsquo;t about electing a new leader, though I realised that would be part of it. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t about Jeremy Corbyn: I made the decision before Ed Miliband had even resigned, and enacted it before the leadership candidates had been nominated.</p>
<p>And for what it&rsquo;s worth, I joined as a full member, not one of these £3 Supporters that we&rsquo;ve been hearing so much about.</p>
<p>I think the aftermath of the Scottish referendum had some effect on my decision. Seeing how the failure of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote energised the SNP and led many supporters to join led me to hope that something similar would happen with Labour. As indeed it has.</p>
<p>Anyway, getting back to that choice of leader. It&rsquo;s long past time that Labour had a woman as its leader, but neither of those standing are right for me. Where we are right now, Corbyn&rsquo;s views most closely match my own values. When he says things like this:</p>
</p><blockquote>
  Paying tax is not a burden. It is the subscription we pay to live in a civilised society.
<p>&ndash; &ldquo;<a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/jeremyforlabour/pages/70/attachments/original/1437556345/TheEconomyIn2020_JeremyCorbyn-220715.pdf?1437556345">The Economy in 2020</a>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is exactly the kind of thing I&rsquo;ve been saying about tax for years.</p>
<p>There is much else. I&rsquo;m not convinced about leaving NATO, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a fundamental policy. I do think we shouldn&rsquo;t waste vast amounts of money on replacing Trident. The cold war is over, more or less.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> And even if Russia is getting alarmingly expansionist these days, a British not-really-independent nuclear missile submarine is going to worry them much.</p>
<p>Corbyn might not be electable &ndash; I doubt that analysis, but let&rsquo;s go with it for now &ndash; but he should at least lead a Labour party in opposition that <em>actually opposes the government</em>. Which, with its slim majority, could actually be vulnerable.</p>
<p>Interesting times ahead.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I read this under false pretences. Self-inflicted false pretences, to be sure, but nonetheless.
<p>It <a href="http://www.clarkeaward.com/2015-winner/">won the Clarke Award</a>, as I&rsquo;m sure you know. All I knew about it when I heard the result, when I saw Mandel&rsquo;s acceptance video at the ceremony, was the title. But it&rsquo;s a badge of recognition, if nothing else; a clear signal that a group of people, of our peers, perhaps, think it&rsquo;s one of the best books &ndash; maybe <em>the</em> best &ndash; released in the last year.</p>
<p>I downloaded it on Kindle (I think there was a special offer). I hadn&rsquo;t read any reviews, not even the blurb. But it&rsquo;s called <cite>Station Eleven</cite>: it&rsquo;s got to be about a space station, right?</p>
<p>Well, &ldquo;Station Eleven&rdquo; is a space station of sorts. But this isn&rsquo;t a story set on it, or in space at all. Well, except inasmuch as Earth is in space, which of course is totally.</p>
<p>Thing is, if I&rsquo;d known this was actually set mainly in a post-end-of-civilisation dystopia, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have read it it at all. Such scenarios really don&rsquo;t appeal to me much, at face value at least. I&rsquo;m always reminded of a call for stories in <cite>Interzone</cite> many years ago, which asked for &ldquo;radical, hard SF&rdquo;; but which specifically said they didn&rsquo;t want the kind of post-holocaust story where the hero gazes wistfully at a can of baked beans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an image which has stuck with me, but this is not that kind of story (though there are elements of scavenging among the ruins).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not set entirely after the fall of civilisation. In part it tells the life story of a successful actor (who dies on stage while playing Lear right at the start of the first chapter).</p>
<p>I note that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/06/arthur-c-clarke-award-station-eleven-emily-st-john-mandel">Mandel herself seems to reject the SF label</a>, and my thoughts on it &ndash; while loving it to bits &ndash; centred around wondering why she chose to tell the story of a present-day actor framed or intertwined within the death of civilisation. Looking at some reviews now I see that people treat the central theme as being the attempt to keep culture alive. And while that is an important aspect, I don&rsquo;t really see it as being what the book is <em>about</em>.</p>
<p>Particularly if we are to consider it as literary fiction<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> wherein characters are usually the main focus. As such it&rsquo;s mainly the stories of the actor and of the young woman who started out as a child actor who was onstage when he died, but who survived the plague.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/books/review/station-eleven-by-emily-st-john-mandel.html">conclusion of this review at the <cite>New York Times</cite></a> sums it up well:</p>
</p><blockquote>
  If “Station Eleven” reveals little insight into the effects of extreme terror and misery on humanity, it offers comfort and hope to those who believe, or want to believe, that doomsday can be survived, that in spite of everything people will remain good at heart, and that when they start building a new world they will want what was best about the old.
</blockquote>
<p>SF or not, it&rsquo;s well worth reading.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I hadn't heard Zane Lowe, as I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/03/13/on-missing-out-on-zane/">mentioned before</a>. So when Apple Music launched, with its Beats 1 streaming radio service, for which Zane is the flagship DJ, I was interested to check him out.
<p>A number of sources had led me to the belief that Zane, at Radio One, had effectively been the new John Peel. Nobody can live up to that claim, I suspect, but to me it meant that he must have a particular set of talents and abilities:</p>
</p><ul>
<li>plays music of their own choice, free from playlists mandated by the station management;</li>
<li>actively seeks out new music;</li>
<li>communicates their enthusiasm to the listener;</li>
<li>plays the tracks in full, without talking over the beginning or end.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now heard Zane on Beats 1 a couple of times, and he certainly fulfils the first three of those criteria. But he fails dramatically on the fourth.</p>
<p>The thing with Peelie was, he played the track. He respected it, gave it space to succeed or fail on its own merit. Certainly he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;This is the new one from so-and-so, and I think it&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; or whatever; but then he&rsquo;d let you hear the record. The actual record. All of it. The whole thing.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Zane does not do that.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m afraid he talks over the records. And not just over instrumental intros or &ldquo;chasing the fade,&rdquo; either. I&rsquo;ve heard him popping up right in the middle of a song with a word or two.</p>
<p>One of the people who spoke highly of Zane was <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke">Myke Hurley</a> of <a href="http://relay.fm">Relay FM</a>, the podcast network. In particular I had heard him talking on the <a href="http://relay.fm/upgrade">Upgrade podcast</a> about what a good guy Zane was.</p>
<p>So when I heard Mr Lowe talking over the tracks, I tweeted with the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/askupgrade">#AskUpgrade</a> tag, which is one of their feedback mechanisms:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AskUpgrade?src=hash">#AskUpgrade</a> Myke, if Zane Lowe is so great, how come he talks over the records (err, tracks)? Isn't meant to be in the Peel mould?</p>— Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/619459112951222272">July 10, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>They read out my question on the next episode, <a href="http://www.relay.fm/upgrade/45">45, I think</a>. Make said I sounded &ldquo;very angry&rdquo;, which I wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; just disappointed. And then we exchanged a few tweets:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/imyke">[@imyke](https://micro.blog/imyke)</a> Thanks for answering my Zane Lowe question on Upgrade. I wasn’t “very angry”, just disappointed, as I’d hoped for a new Peel.</p>— Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/620943218579009536">July 14, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/imyke">[@imyke](https://micro.blog/imyke)</a> One of Peel’s gifts was that he talked about the music between the tracks. (Which among other things made it easy to record them.)</p>— Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/620943717504040960">July 14, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate">[@devilgate](https://micro.blog/devilgate)</a> I don’t know if I’d call that a ‘gift’ 
<p>If all you’re looking for is the music, subscribe to zane’s playlists</p>— Myke Hurley (@imyke) <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke/status/620944044512931840">July 14, 2015</a></blockquote></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/imyke">[@imyke](https://micro.blog/imyke)</a> No, “trick”, or “technique”, maybe. Thing is I’d like the talk, the enthusiasm; just not over the music.</p>— Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/620944298121560064">July 14, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about where we left it. I don&rsquo;t think I got across my main point very well (140 characters is hard sometimes). But I&rsquo;ve expressed it clearly enough up top there, I think.</p>
<p>Beats One is still interesting, and Apple Music has many interesting features. But I&rsquo;m still looking for a DJ that knows how to treat records right.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>The next book in the <cite>Patternist</cite> series after <cite><a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/06/25/wild-seed-by-octavia-e-butler-books-2015-5/">Wild Seed</a></cite>, which I wrote about before. I would describe it as the sequel to the other one, except that it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patternist_series">turns out</a> that they were written out of sequence.
<p>This perhaps explains why the character of Anyanwu, who, as you&rsquo;ll recall, I felt was slightly disappointing in the first book, is completely sidelined and, indeed, thrown away, in this one.</p>
<p>The other reason is that the focus has moved on to a new generation of Doro&rsquo;s descendants. We are in mid to late 20th-century America, and his breeding programme is finally beginning to pay off. More spectacularly than he had ever imagined, it seems, as some of his telepaths &ndash; who up until now have not been able to bear being near each other &ndash; form a kind of group or meld they call the Pattern.</p>
<p>This makes them able to both work and live together, and increases their power and effectiveness enormously.</p>
<p>Things ensue. It&rsquo;s good, but still feels kind of weak to me. I enjoyed it, but it wasn&rsquo;t that compelling.</p>
<p>Also I thought I had read this one, years ago, but none of it was even the slightest bit familiar to me, so I guess not.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>The day after I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/07/10/the-souths-heritage-is-so-much-more-than-a-flag/">post</a> linking to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/magazine/the-souths-heritage-is-so-much-more-than-a-flag.html">Patterson Hood's NYT piece</a>, I get an email from Amazon recommending a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002D0WDSW">Drive-By Truckers album</a>. I assumed it was a new one.
<p>Not too spooky &ndash; I doubt their bots are reading my blog. It&rsquo;s nothing more than the fact that I&rsquo;ve bought DBT albums from Amazon before. Only the timing was surprising &ndash; plus the fact that I had no idea that the album was coming out. Though <a href="http://drivebytruckers.shop.musictoday.com/Product.aspx?cp=407_65717&amp;pc=D2CD13">further research</a> shows that it&rsquo;s not actually a new album, making Amazon&rsquo;s prompt slightly more suspect again.</p>
<p>Anyway the interesting thing about this album &ndash; <cite>The Fine Print: A Collection Of Oddities And Rarities 2003-2008</cite> &ndash; is that it contains a track called &lsquo;Play it All Night Long&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m assuming that this must be a cover of <a href="http://warrenzevon.wikia.com/wiki/Play_It_All_Night_Long">Warren Zevon&rsquo;s song of the same name</a>.</p>
<p>Now, that song is a dissection of DBT&rsquo;s beloved Lynyrd Skynyrd. Or at least it uses &ldquo;that dead band&rsquo;s song&rdquo; as part of its critique of the South. For DBT to cover it must be an example of &ldquo;the duality of the southern thing,&rdquo; of which they speak extensively on <cite><a href="http://drivebytruckers.shop.musictoday.com/Product.aspx?cp=407_65717&amp;pc=D2CD01">Southern Rock Opera</a></cite>.</p>
<p>Of course, large parts of that album are about Skynyrd, so covering a song that is <em>also</em> partly about them isn&rsquo;t much of a stretch. Thing is, Zevon&rsquo;s song is less than positive about the South as a whole, or Skynyrd by implication. Not, of course, that the DBTs are entirely positive about the South; that duality again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Play it All Night Long&rsquo; is also the only known song &ndash; known by me, at least &ndash; to contain the word &ldquo;brucellosis&rdquo;.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Halfway through the year and only five books in? This is shocking behaviour!
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I read this, and I sort of enjoyed it, but I wasn&rsquo;t entirely happy with it.</p>
<p>There are two main characters, both of whom appear to be functionally immortal, though with different mechanisms for keeping them alive. The shapeshifting, self-healing (and healer of others) Anyanwu is an African woman in the seventeenth century when we meet her. She is already two or three hundred years old.</p>
<p>The male immortal, Doro, is even older. For perhaps thousands of years he has survived by stealing bodies. His consciousness hops from his current one to another when the latter threatens him, or just when he chooses it. The personality of his destination body is of course destroyed in the hop, and the body he leaves also dies. Anyanwu is attracted to his power and the fact that they are apparently the only such long-lived people on Earth, but is repelled by the mechanism of his survival.</p>
<p>As she is by his long-term (<em>really</em> long-term) project to try to breed people with special abilities &ndash; many of the subjects of which are, or may be, distant descendants of her, or of his original people (most of whom he killed in panic when he first &ldquo;died&rdquo; and found himself in a new body).</p>
<p>I was annoyed at Anyanwu as a character at times, by the way she didn&rsquo;t resist Doro when he had her do things she didn&rsquo;t want to do. But he is an expert manipulator and is willing to threaten her kids to bend her to his will. And I guess that cleverly evokes the reality of women&rsquo;s situation often in history, and certainly at that time.</p>
<p>This is the start of the <cite>Seed to Harvest</cite> series, and I&rsquo;m keen to see where it goes.</p>

<p>Following on from my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/05/04/on-things-never-seen/">On things never seen</a> post, yesterday was Father's Day, and we watched <cite>The Phantom Menace</cite>. </p>
<p>It is not as bad – not <em>nearly</em> as bad – as nearly everyone makes out. </p>
<p>It <em>starts</em> badly, oddly enough. Not just the dull scroll about the Trade Federation, but then you have the Japanese-sounding guys in charge of the blockade and invasion, who are voiced by people who seemingly can't act. Their dialogue is frankly embarrassing. </p>
<p>But much of it is fine. Sure, there are holes in the logic, places where it doesn't exactly make sense; but what film doesn't have instances like that?</p>
<p>Even – and I realise I'm committing a kind of geek sacrilege as I write this – even Jar-Jar Binks isn't that annoying. Could the plot have worked without him, or with him not being a comedic figure? Of course. But having him as he is, does no harm. </p>
<p>But hey: I liked Wesley Crusher, too. </p>
<p>And that's about as much as I'm going to say about it for now. </p>

  David Cameron has backed plans to give Ofcom stronger powers to prevent the broadcast of “extremist messages” despite concerns from one of his own cabinet ministers that this could amount to state censorship.
<p>The prime minister appeared to support Theresa May, the home secretary, after the Guardian revealed a split in the cabinet over her counter-extremism measures.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Well how the hell did <em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/what-will-the-new-tory-government-do">that</a></em> happen?
<p>There are two questions there:</p>
</p><ol>
<li>How could the opinion polls be so wrong? and</li>
<li>Why did all those people make such bad choices?</li>
</ol>
<p>On the radio they were talking about &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/election-2015-how-shy-tories-confounded-polls-cameron-victory">shy Tories</a>&rdquo; as an answer to 1. That&rsquo;s a term that was coined after the 1992 election, apparently, to describe all those people who voted Tory but who had never let anyone know that that was what they were planning. I remember the aftermath of that one, and the thing that struck me was all those people I worked with who read the <cite>Telegraph</cite> &ldquo;for the sport&rdquo;; and how smug they looked that morning.</p>
<p>I became wise to that. But nowadays no-one comes into work with a paper any more, so it&rsquo;s harder to tell such things. And how would it help, even if they did and you could?</p>
<p>The thing is, the pre-election polls must have been deceived.</p>
<p>Of course, no-one is obliged to tell the truth to a pollster. No-one is obliged to even answer their questions. But if you do agree to answer their questions: <em>why would you lie?</em></p>
<p>I can think of only two possible reasons. Maybe you want to deliberately skew the poll results. But that seems unlikely. Sure, some people will feel like that; a few. But not lots. Not enough to actually have a deceptive effect.</p>
<p>And the other reason why, if you answered, you might lie; the only other reason I can think that might make people lie to a pollster.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re embarrassed about your answer. Or stronger: because you&rsquo;re <em>ashamed</em> of it.</p>
<p>Shame can be a powerful influencer.</p>
<p>And it makes sense that people would be ashamed of voting Tory. Most of us were brought up to know that we shouldn&rsquo;t be selfish; that sharing is best, and just being out for yourself is bad. We learn that at our mother&rsquo;s knee, generally.</p>
<p>This tweet from Irvine Welsh sums up what I think is a good approach;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you're not doing so well, vote for a better life for yourself. If you are doing quite nicely, vote for a better life for others.</p>— Irvine Welsh (@IrvineWelsh) <a href="https://twitter.com/IrvineWelsh/status/596263263928713216">May 7, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reasonably comfortably off, and you&rsquo;re voting for the party that you think is going to make you better off &ndash; no matter how wrong you might be;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and if you&rsquo;re doing it mainly <em>because</em> you think that &ndash; then you are selfish and ought to be ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p>And in that attempt to answer the first question, I appear to have answered the second one as well. Why did all those Tory voters make such bad choices?</p>
<p>Selfishness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll hurt us all.</body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>There's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ve_Never_Seen_Star_Wars_(radio_series)">programme on Radio 4</a> from time to time (and it has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I've_Never_Seen_Star_Wars_(TV_series)">made the transition to TV</a>) called <cite>I've Never Seen Star Wars</cite>. In it Marcus Brigstocke gets a guest to try things that they have never tired before. Conversation ensues, and it can be amusing.
<p>Anyway, the title clearly derives from how unlikely it is that anyone (of a certain generation or three, at least) will <em>not</em> have seen it.</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re worrying, I saw the original &ndash; back when it was just called <cite>Star Wars</cite>, without the <cite>Episode IV: A New Hope</cite> subtitle &ndash; in the cinema (probably second run, not first, but still). And the second and third, of course.</p>
<p>But then there was the prequel trilogy. To be honest, when <cite>The Phantom Menace</cite> came out, I don&rsquo;t think I was all that interested. I had known from early on that Lucas had planned the original as part of the middle trilogy of three. But by the time the prequels started, it had been so <em>long</em> that it just didn&rsquo;t seem very important, you know?</p>
<p>And more importantly, in 1999 when it came out, I had a small child. We weren&rsquo;t going to many films that weren&rsquo;t aimed at like two-year olds. And after that, there was always something more interesting, more pressing to see&hellip;</p>
<p>I mislead you slightly, here. I did, in fact, see <cite>The Phantom Menace</cite>, after a fashion: on a shonky old VHS, with a three-year old sweetly chattering on the sofa next to me throughout. It hardly counts. And I definitely haven&rsquo;t seen the others.</p>
<p>And I know everyone says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother, don&rsquo;t waste your time, they&rsquo;re terrible;&rdquo; but they can only say that because they&rsquo;ve seen them. And now &ndash; now there&rsquo;s a new one coming down the line. Episode VII, <cite>The Force Awakens</cite> is due out in December, and I&rsquo;ll certainly want to see it. Of course, it will follow on from <cite>Return of the Jedi</cite>, and it probably won&rsquo;t matter if you haven&rsquo;t seen episodes I-III; but it just wouldn&rsquo;t feel right to not see them.</p>
<p>So I intend to watch the prequel trilogy. I was going to start today &ndash; the fourth of May be with you, and all that &ndash; but events got in the way. Still, over the next few weeks I&rsquo;ll watch all three, and report back here.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I'm taking the <a href="http://tempest.fluidartist.com/non-fiction/the-challenge/">Tempest Challenge</a>.
<p>I was somewhere in the middle of the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/03/22/emotionally-weird-by-kate-atkinson-books-2015-3/">third book</a> I read this year when I heard of it, and I realised that all my reading so far was books by women, and so why not?</p>
<p>The idea of the challenge, in case you haven&rsquo;t clicked through, is to:</p>
</p><blockquote>
  take <em><strong>One Year</strong></em> off from reading fiction by straight, white, cisgender male authors and instead read fiction by authors who come from minority or marginalized groups. This includes women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ authors along with a wide variety of other marginalized identities from which to create a reading list: people with disabilities; poor and working class authors; writers with non-Christian religious or spiritual beliefs; and for Americans, even reading books in translation by authors of any background will open up new viewpoints.
</blockquote>
<p>Which, when you list as many categories of author as that, sounds pretty easy. And so it is.</p>
<p>So far, as you&rsquo;ll have seen from my published notes to date, I&rsquo;ve just read books by women. No trouble there. I&rsquo;m currently reading <cite>Wild Seed</cite> by Octavia E Butler, which also adds African-American to the mix.</p>
<p>The only problem &ndash; and it is, let&rsquo;s face it, a very minor one &ndash; is when I see a book on my shelves that I think, &ldquo;Oh, I must read that;&rdquo; and then I think, &ldquo;but not this year.&rdquo; (Though it occurs that if I were to take &ldquo;writers with non-Christian religious or spiritual beliefs&rdquo; at face value, then I could, for example, carry on my Iain Banks re-read; but such writers &ndash; atheist writers, at least &ndash; are far from marginalised in Britain. And it wouldn&rsquo;t really be in the spirit.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making two exceptions: one is a book I started last year, about the music scene in New York in the 70s. It&rsquo;s important preparation for our trip to New York in the summer, so I intend to finish that.</p>
<p>The other is if <a href="http://robert-galbraith.com">Robert Galbraith</a> has a new book out this year. :-) And in getting that link I discover that it&rsquo;s due out in the autumn, which is pleasing to hear.</p>
<p>Apparently some people are offended by the very existence of this kind of challenge. Mostly straight white men, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to hear. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;censorship&rdquo;, apparently. I mean, what?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll read all about my reading adventures here.</body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>I won this in the raffle at a <a href="http://www.bsfa.co.uk">BSFA</a> meeting several months ago (actually over a year: <a href="https://bsfa.co.uk/october-bsfa-london-meeting-mary-robinette-kowal-interviewed-by-virginia-preston/">October 2013</a>), when Mary Robinette Kowal was the guest. From her talk, it sounded like it would be a lot of fun, and now that I get round to reading it, it lives up to that expectation.
<p>We are in Regency times, except this is not exactly the Regency of our own past; in this one, magic exists. At least in a limited form: &ldquo;Glamour&rdquo; allows people to form illusions by manipulating folds of the ether. Most people can do this to some degree, and well-brought-up young ladies are taught the art along with music and painting. But there are those who are more talented.</p>
<p>Our heroine, Jane, is one such. But as the novel opens, and for most of it, she is more concerned about the fact that, unmarried at 28, she seems destined to become (or already is) an &ldquo;old maid&rdquo;. Her prettier sister, Melody, is more likely to make a good &ldquo;match&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are, of course, balls, officers, heartbreaks, and more. If you enjoy Austen, and fantasy, you&rsquo;ll like this, I predict. It&rsquo;s the first in a series, and I look forward to reading more.</p>
<p>One thing slightly puzzled me. When Kowal was at the BSFA meeting, I recall her saying that she is a <cite>Doctor Who</cite> fan, and that she likes to slip a mysterious traveller into each of her books. If she slipped him into this one, she did it so subtly that I didn&rsquo;t notice it, even though I was expecting him. There is a brief appearance from the local surgeon, a Dr Smythe, so I guess that&rsquo;s him. <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/04/ive-hidden-the-doctor-in-all-of-my-historical-fantasy-novels">Oh yes</a>. In fact, she says in that piece, &ldquo;if you [notice him], then I’ve done it wrong.&rdquo; So, nicely done.</p>
<p>But anyway, well worth a read, though I daresay the purist would say you should read all of Austen first (which I haven&rsquo;t; only <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite>).</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>This is all very meta. It's a story within a story, with at least one other story within that (the last of which is not very relevant). And the two main ones are more intertwined, rather than one enclosing the other, with typefaces used to distinguish them.
<p>The largest story is that of a young woman during her time at Dundee University &ndash; in fact really just a few days in one term thereat. She&rsquo;s a bit of a drip, just drifting along letting stuff happen to her &ndash; including repeatedly getting into a car with an unknown strange man who claims to be a private detective.</p>
<p>But the same time she (and I can&rsquo;t remember her name, which can be a problem with first-person characters, because how often do you use your own name?) is holding an extended conversation with her mother (who, we&rsquo;re repeatedly told, is not her mother) on a remote Scottish island whereon they are the only residents. She is trying to get her mother to tell <em>her</em> story. The mother is not keen to do so.</p>
<p>The slice-of-student-life in seventies Dundee is interesting enough. I&rsquo;ve never been to Dundee, but I was a student in Edinburgh in the eighties, and it doesn&rsquo;t sound all that different. Indeed, that story could be enough to carry a novel, if you had a slightly more active protagonist, and more of a plot.</p>
<p>The plot, such as it is, is in the island story. Well, the mystery is mainly told there, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it all well enough while I was reading it, but can&rsquo;t help but wonder what it&rsquo;s really <em>for</em>. That&rsquo;s not something I would normally ask of a novel &ndash; they are their own justification, generally; they exist to tell their story, and that&rsquo;s all you need. But here, well&hellip; there isn&rsquo;t quite enough of a story. It describes itself &ndash; within the island story, of the Dundee story; that&rsquo;s part of the metaness &ndash; as a &ldquo;comic novel&rdquo;. And yes, there&rsquo;s humour in the university story, and maybe beyond. But it &rsquo;s not exactly <em>funny</em>, you know?</p>
<p>And the last section is a detective story that the protagonist of the Dundee story is writing. But it doesn&rsquo;t really relate to either of the other stories &ndash; except maybe by some imagery &ndash; and it doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere. So I don&rsquo;t really see why it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>When I read Atkinson&rsquo;s debut, <cite>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</cite>, I likened it to <cite>The Crow Road</cite>. Sadly, this doesn&rsquo;t live up to that promise. Luckily she went on to write <cite>Life After Life</cite>, which as you&rsquo;ll recall, <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/03/26/the-first-three-books-of-the-year/">I loved</a>.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I've probably meant to write about this kind of thing for years: first records, the first bands I saw live, and so on. I was prompted to finally visit it by a <a href="https://reprog.wordpress.com/2015/03/11/im-going-to-see-paul-mccartney/">post over at The Reinvigorated Programmer</a>.
<p>The Programmer tells us of his first record, and links it to his impending trip to see Paul McCartney. I note that, irrespective of his first single, he knows what the first album he owned was. I don&rsquo;t. I can tell you the first singles I was given (one now spoiled by the epidemic of 70s celebrities having been slimeballs), the first I bought by choice (maximally embarrassing), and various other details. But the first album? I&rsquo;m not sure. Not sure at all.</p>
<p>I can tell you the first album we owned as a family: it was called <cite>Bing and Louis</cite>, by Messrs Crosby and Armstrong. We had gone to a hi-fi shop in Glasgow to buy a stereo (which for some reason my parents pronounced &ldquo;steer-ee-oh&rdquo;, and did for years thereafter). We hadn&rsquo;t had any kind of record player before then. I must have been about seven, maybe?</p>
<p>Anyway, the guy in the shop was using this Crosby and Armstrong record<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to demo the turntable, and my Mum liked it so much that he gave it to us. As I recall it was always really badly scratched &ndash; crackly, not sticking &ndash; so it makes me wonder why on Earth he was using it to demo anything. Unless it was like, &ldquo;This system is so good you&rsquo;ll hear every crackle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that initial record, my parents mainly had soundtrack albums &ndash; or at least, those were the ones that I remember listening to. <cite>The Sound of Music</cite>, <cite>Paint Your Wagon</cite>, <cite>Cabaret</cite>&hellip; I know, the latter was most unsuitable. Except the music isn&rsquo;t (unless you&rsquo;re overly influenced by &ldquo;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&rdquo;). It was years later before I saw the film.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>And as I think back to the cupboard under the stereo, I&rsquo;m remembering a couple of albums that were bought for me that are not the one I was going to mention (inasmuch as was going to mention early albums at all, which I wasn&rsquo;t when I started writing this).</p>
<p>There was an album of really bad versions of TV themes &ndash; mainly SF ones, I think, as the only ones I can remember are <cite>Doctor Who</cite> and <cite>Star Trek</cite>. The former was bad, but the latter was so bad that I remember my friend Scot saying, &ldquo;The shite&rsquo;s coming out&rdquo; when it started playing one time, after I had described it as &ldquo;shite&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Why did we listen to it, then? I dunno. I guess we were musically starved to death.</p>
<p>And something from when I was a bit younger, called, if I recall correctly, <cite>Tubby the Tuba</cite>. I don&rsquo;t even want to google that.</p>
<p>I think there was also at least one Disney soundtrack album. Maybe the animated <cite>Robin Hood</cite>?</p>
<p>The thing I was thinking of, though, that was at least something like a rock or pop album, was given to me by my brother one Christmas. It was called <cite>Blockbusters</cite>, and it consisted of songs by The Sweet, Mud and Suzi Quatro, <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/04/10/why-devilgate/">making it a seminal influence on me, considering my origin story</a>. And I still have that one.</p>
<p>The connection between the three, as the well-informed musicologist will know, is that they were all <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/277811-Chinnichap">Chinnichap</a> artists. Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman were the Stock, Aitken and Waterman of their day.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>It was a great album, with all the hits you could want: &ldquo;Blockbuster&rdquo; itself, of course; &ldquo;Tiger Feet&rdquo;; &ldquo;Dynamite&rdquo;; and of course, &ldquo;Devil Gate Drive&rdquo;, and more.</p>
<p>It was only years later that I realised that they weren&rsquo;t by the original artists. These were the days before compilations like the <cite>Now That&rsquo;s What I Call Music!</cite> series, which reliably package up a selection of the year&rsquo;s chart hits, properly credited and in their original single form. Back then, every year saw another album in the <cite>Top of the Pops</cite> series, which shared only the name with the TV show. On them you got a selection of the year&rsquo;s hits, performed by a studio band doing passable clones of the originals.</p>
<p>My <cite>Blockbusters</cite> album was the same kind of thing, but focused on a single songwriting team.</p>
<p>It was still good, though.</p>
<p>But none of this leads me any closer to remembering what the first album I <em>chose</em> to buy (or asked to have bought for me) was. Possibly it was something by The Beatles. It wasn&rsquo;t till my sister gave me a reel-to-reel tape of Beatles singles that I really got into music.</p>
<p>But I suspect the only way to be sure will be to do a careful inventory of my records. Which is project for another time.</p>
<p>By now, though, you&rsquo;re probably desperate to know about those embarrassing or spoiled early singles. Or, you&rsquo;ve completely forgotten about them.</p>
<p>Some time after we got the stereo, I was given two singles: &ldquo;The Laughing Gnome&rdquo; by David Bowie; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Leader of the Gang (I am)&rdquo; by Gary Glitter. Who&rsquo;d have thought that the second of those would come to be the more embarrassing?</p>
<p>Then a few years later, after Britain&rsquo;s Eurovision triumph, I took a liking to the Brotherhood of Man, and bought &ldquo;Oh Boy (The Mood I&rsquo;m In)&rdquo;. Which &ndash; oh my god! &ndash; was in 1977. I am ashamed.</p>
<p>I bought it in Boots (the shop, not the footwear), if I remember rightly. Remember when they were kind of a department store, and sold records?</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><h3>URL hiding</h3>
<p>A while ago, I read a piece called “<a href="http://jakearchibald.com/2014/improving-the-url-bar/">Improving the URL Bar</a>&quot; (turns out it’s almost a year old, but never mind). I made both mental and <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>-based notes of it, because my response to it was, “That’s not improving the URL bar, it’s destroying it.&quot;</p>
<p>Reading it again now, I don’t feel quite so strongly; I partly agree with what the author was getting at. But I feel we lose something important as we make URLs less visible. They show something of the hierarchy of a site, its structure — or at least that’s the origin of the path part.</p>
<p>The argument against that of course is that the path part is an implentation detail that doesn’t need to be seen by users, and perhaps more importantly, the whole thing is meaningless at best, confusing at worst to most users.</p>
<p>Well, maybe so. But to those of us who <em>do</em> understand them, hiding them can be confusing, even annoying.Of course you can click in the URL bar, or press Cmd-L or Ctrl-L, to see the whole thing. More usefully, In Safari, which I’m currently using, there’s a preference called “Show full website address”, which overrides the behaviour. So you can have your choice.</p>
<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>But then there’s this whole thing that we have now, of browsers doing a search when you type something in URL bar; especially (though not exclusively) when it’s not obviously a URL that you’ve typed or pasted.</p>
<p>I don’t like it.</p>
<p>Or I didn’t. I’ve been using Safari since I wiped and reinstalled this Mac because it was getting really slow (successfully, I might add). I decided to keep things as stock as possible (within reason — I wasn’t going to switch back from Lightroom to iPhoto, for example, or from MailMate to Mail.app). And Firefox can sometimes be a bit of a resource hog.</p>
<p>But I spent quite some time trying to find out how to give Safari a separate search bar like FF has (or can have — it may be a plugin, but if so it’s one that I install without thinking). I had muscle memory that went Cmd-T, Cmd-K (or Ctrl-T, Ctrl-T when I’m on Windows) when I want a new tab I’m going to search in. Still have it, actually, because I still use FF on Windows on my work machine.</p>
<p>It turns out that you can’t have that on Safari. You just have to search from the URL bar. So I just got into the habit of doing that. And now I find I do it even on Firefox (you have both options there).</p>
<p>I don’t know; I still feel that the URL bar should be for URLs, and searching should be something else. but it doesn’t offend me like it used to.</p>
<p>Still, the effect is to further blur the distinction between searching for a site and going to a specific site. I see people — even experienced, technically knowledgable people — going to Google’s home page and typing “facebook.com” into the search box. I mean, what?</p>
<p>Oh, and of course if you search from Google’s home page in Chrome, your cursor jumps to the URL bar! Or it did the last time I used Chrome. Which blurs the distinction between site and browser, as well as between site and search.</p>
<p>In the end it doesn’t matter that much — people mostly get where they mean to go — but by making it less than clear what is going on when we navigate around the web, we make it harder for people to understand how it&rsquo;s all put together, and I think we lose something important in doing so.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I feel strangely that I've missed out on Zane Lowe -- on knowing who he is as a DJ, as an interviewer; maybe even as the inheritor of John Peel's Radio One mantle. And now he's off to Apple.
<p>I&rsquo;ve just been listening to an interview with Lowe on <a href="http://www.scroobiuspip.co.uk/distraction-pieces-podcast/">Scroobius Pip&rsquo;s <cite>Distraction Pieces</cite> podcast</a>, and he comes across as very interesting and informed. And I heard about his Apple move recently on another podcast, wherein <a href="http://www.relay.fm/people/mykehurley">Myke Hurley</a> talked about his move and how he had been the best introducer of new music at Radio One since Peel.</p>
<p>(Podcasts are the new rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll radio: discuss.)</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never knowingly heard his show.</p>
<p>Which is a shame, on one level. But on another &ndash; how often have I listened to Radio One since Peel died? &ndash; maybe it&rsquo;s not really my music any more.</p>
<p>Though on yet another hand, Lowe namechecks Neil Young and various other people that <em>are</em> my music, so&hellip;</p>
<p>As to what exactly he&rsquo;s going to be doing at Apple, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/16/zane-lowe-Apple-bbc-london-radio1-la">no-one outside knows for sure</a>. &ldquo;Music curation&rdquo; seems to be the consensus, something to do with the streaming service they might be launching on the back of the Beats acquisition. The Pip podcast was recorded back in October, before he announced the move, so he doesn&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear, though, that, like Peelie, he&rsquo;s a music fan above all else.</p></body></html></p>

			<h1><a href="https://devilgate.org/2015/03/06/the-first-fifteen-lives-of/">The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North (Books 2015, 2)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2015/03/06/the-first-fifteen-lives-of/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2015-03-06 01:24:51 &#43;0100">Mar 6, 2015</time></a>

			 <html><body><p>There's an old saying by Robert Heinlein (or by one or more of his characters): "It steam-engines when it comes steam-engine time." Technological advances -- and implicitly, other changes, such as social ones -- will happen when a certain weight of events and situations accrues, irrespective of the individuals involved. The steam engine would have been developed around that time with or without Stephenson; the radio in its era even without Marconi, and so on.
<p>By that token these few years seem to be time-jump-story time. For here we have a story that, superficially at least, is very similar to <cite>Life After Life</cite>, which I wrote about last year as part of <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/03/26/the-first-three-books-of-the-year/">The First Three Books of the Year</a>.</p>
<p>The similarity is that we have a character who lives his life, dies, and then lives it all over again. The major differences in this case are that he remembers his previous lives; and that there are others like him.</p>
<p>Also in this one the characters &ndash; some of them, at least &ndash; question their situation, wonder about how and why it happens. They make use of their gift or curse. As such it is more a work of SF than <cite>Life After Life</cite> was.</p>
<p>Claire North, we are told at the start, is the pseudonym of a British author. Turns out it&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Webb">Catherine Webb</a>, of whom I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2006/12/06/book-notes-16-the-extraordinary-and-unusual-adventures-of-horatio-lyle-by-catherine-webb/">written before, here</a>. I see that I was critical then of her plotting, and the ending. The current book is much stronger in both regards.</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s not entirely satisfactory. I find it slightly annoying because &ndash; and I&rsquo;m moving into spoiler territory, so you might want to stop reading &ndash; while the people who have this affliction &ndash; members of the Cronus Club, or <em>kalachakra</em>, as they are called &ndash; do ask some questions of their situation, the only one who really tries to explore, to investigate, to understand it: he&rsquo;s the bad guy. The engine of the plot is to preserve the status quo.</p>
<p>True (within the book, and probably in reality), messing with the status quo &ndash; trying to make significant changes to the way historic events play out &ndash; tends to make a big mess of things, because history is too complex for anyone to really understand all the causes and effects and so guide it. But Vincent, the antagonist in question, is at least trying to gain some understanding. An alternative to trying to stop him might have been to work with him, but find a less destructive way to do it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, of course, that would have made for a less interesting, less fun story. And as it stands, this is both. So I can&rsquo;t really complain.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>This is kind of a frustrating one (and could, like <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/01/19/clothes-clothes-clothes-music-music-music-boys-boys-boys-by-viv-albertine-books-2014-20/">the last one</a> have been considered 2014, as I started it before the year ended; but it was well into January before I finished it.
<p>Anyway, Pynchon can be difficult. I read <cite>V</cite> years back, and remember next to nothing about it; and I started <cite>Gravity&rsquo;s Rainbow</cite> once, but ground to a halt and never quite got round to going back (this despite the fact that I was originally drawn to it by Alan Moore talking about reading it).</p>
<p>This one is a lot less difficult, to say nothing of significantly shorter. Its problem is more to do with how our heroine comes to find out about the weird postal conspiracy that she investigates, and why it matters. We have some engaging characters in interesting situations, but it&rsquo;s hard to get terribly enthused about a conspiracy to route the post by some means other than official government mail channels.</p>
<p>Especially in these deregulated times, when most of the post is deliveries from Amazon anyway. <a href="http://cl49.pynchonwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=The_Crying_of_Lot_49">We Await Silent Bezos&rsquo;s Empire</a>, I guess.</p>

			 <html><body><p>A Christmas present: started on Christmas Day and finished just after midnight on the 3rd of January. So I could call it 2015 number 1, but it makes more sense to go with the year in which I started it and read most of it. Anyway, it’s all a bit arbitrary.</p>
<p><a href="http://vivalbertine.com">Viv Albertine</a>, as I’m sure you know, was the guitarist in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Slits">The Slits</a>. They had only a short time in punk’s limelight (though as I learned from this, they released a second album, not just the one I’m familiar with).</p>
<p>This book is half about her early years and the punk days, and half about after. She went on to work as a filmmaker and then struggled to have a child, had serious health problems. Eventually she re-taught herself to play guitar, and started performing again (I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/11/13/smashing-things-up-for-35-years/">saw her supporting the Damned</a> a couple of years back, and then supporting <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/statuses/345925502747435008?tw_i=345925502747435008&amp;tw_e=details&amp;tw_p=archive">Siouxsie at Meltdown</a> a year and half back).</p>
<p>It’s really interesting reading about a time I lived through, events I experienced — from afar, true, but still ones I felt part of — from someone else’s point of view. Especially that of someone who was at the heart of many of the events.</p>
<p>And she writes with some style; it’s a compelling read. She makes some strange choices: for example, she only ever refers to her sister as “my sister”; we never get her name. Similarly with the man she marries. At first he’s “The Biker”, and then “my husband”.</p>
<p>I suppose it’s a matter of protecting the privacy of people who are still alive — especially in the latter case, because he doesn’t come out of it terribly well. Indeed, it may be the case that the only people who are named are those who were already in the public eye to some degree.</p>
<p>Any road, if you are into music, especially punk, at all, I would highly recommend reading this. I plan to get her new album — which came out two years ago, it turns out — <cite>The Vermilion Border</cite>.</p>

And then just a short time later you get round to reading it, and you think maybe you’ve heard that the author has written a sequel in the meantime?</p>
<p>And then you get to the end and discover that there are now six books in the series! Six! Do you?</p>
<p>That’s a definition of time passing without you noticing it properly. It’s very bad.</p>
<p>Unlike this book, which is very good; especially if you like tales of people escaping from hell and battling with demons, angels, and other creatures of the supernatural, while running a video store (sort of), drinking Jack Daniels, and stealing cars in LA (why does he steal cars when he has a key to the Room of Thirteen Doors, which can take him anywhere?)</p>
<p>Good stuff. And I daresay the sequels will be up to the mark too; though I’m not going to dive straight into those. I’ll give it a rest first.</p>

			 <html><body><p>A rereading, of course; in fact, this is probably something like the sixth time I’ve read this. I keep coming back to it. And why not? There’s music, magic, musings, sex, drugs, and conspiracies. Lots and lots of conspiracies.</p>
<p>It felt very <em>on trend</em>, as the trendy types say, to be reading it in 2014. We are at a time when the idea of the Illuminati is not just well known, but is discussed, or at least panicked about, among our nation’s schoolkids. Apparently lots of modern music stars — people like <a href="http://beginningandend.com/rhianna-illuminati-princess-tweets-satan/">Rihanna</a>, for example — are noted (by paranoid types) for being pawns of (or part of) the “actual” Illuminati.</p>
<p>The clues include any use of triangular imagery in their videos. You get the idea.</p>
<p>The people who believe in that sort of thing are just the types this great trilogy was written for. No, about. No: for.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This is interesting. Seems to have got a lot of attention when it came out, but somehow I wasn't aware of it. It's very much a novel of now, though probably set slightly into the future -- five minutes or so, probably.
<p>Our hero, Mae Holland, is a young woman, not long out of college, who is just starting a job at the Circle. The Circle is GooTwitBook, essentially: a massive internet company that has gobbled up all the previous incumbents (it owns 90% of search, for example) and redefined interaction on the net via its TrueYou identity technology. Real names are not just encouraged; they are required.</p>
<p>Internet trolling disappeared overnight, it seems.Unbelievable enough. Perhaps more so: no-one (almost no-one) seems to be in the least bit bothered by the reductions in privacy, the spread of The Circle into every aspect of life (putting chips in kids to prevent kidnapping; nobody complains; is kidnapping that much of a problem in the US?)</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed it, I should say, before I tear into it too much. Eggers keeps the pages turning, which is always a plus. On the other hand, it takes a long time before anything significant happens. Mae starts her job, learns the ropes, meets people, gets more and more involved in the social-networking aspects of the circle&hellip; we know things are going to take a turn for the dramatic, because the blurb tells us so (&quot;&hellip; the closer she comes to discovering a sinister truth&hellip;&quot;)</p>
<p>But it must be 200-odd pages in (of nearly 500) before we get much more than scene-setting.</p>
<p>And ultimately, while I can see how someone like Mae could be drawn further and further in after starting out with the best intentions, I find it very hard to believe that the entire rest of the world would go along with the extremities of the Circle&rsquo;s plans. It&rsquo;s set in essentially our world: where are the <a href="https://www.eff.org">EFF</a>? Where are the <a href="https://www.aclu.org">ACLU</a>? Where are the voices from other countries that aren&rsquo;t keen on an American corporation&rsquo;s hegemony?</p>
<p>Where, even, are the corporations that stand up for privacy? I&rsquo;ve just got a new iPhone 6 as I write this, and I can&rsquo;t help but think that Apple&rsquo;s pro-privacy stance &ndash; their assertion that no-one can get at our data stored in iCloud &ndash; not even them, not even if there&rsquo;s a court order &ndash; is antithetical to everything that the Circle represents.</p>
<p>Which is one of the reasons why the Circle looks most like Google (it has three guys at the top, known as &ldquo;the Three Wise Men&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Of course, these criticisms might be just symptomatic of what can happen when you approach a &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo;, &ldquo;literary&rdquo; book with a science-fiction head: you question the worldbuilding, of course.</p>
<p>Ultimately it&rsquo;s a shame: the Circle the organisation is completely believable and convincing in itself. It&rsquo;s just hard to believe that it could expand in quite as unchecked a fashion as it does. And I found Mae to be partly endearing, partly annoying, which could be a realistic portrayal, and a good example of characterisation. In truth, though, she has no character. And possibly less believable than the growth of the Circle is the extent to which Mae gives herself to it, to its beliefs; even when they break her best friend, Annie, who got her the job in the first place.</p>
<p>So all in all, something of a wasted opportunity.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>This is an unusual choice. It was a present; I do like poetry, but I probably wouldn’t have chosen it for myself.</p>
<p>But it’s great. I really enjoyed it. It’s a strange story. Set in King Arthur’s round table, of course — at least at the start. The titular hero (Gawain, I mean) is said to be the noblest, bravest, most humble, etc, knight. </p>
<p>A mysterious, supernatural, green figure interrupts the New Year feast at Camelot and issues a challenge. Gawain takes it up, and has a year to complete his side of the deal.</p>
<p>He’s clearly the top procrastinator of the round table, too, because he leaves it till after the following Christmas before he sets off to find the Green Knight.</p>
<p>The noble hero is tested and tempted, and (spoilers) wins through. It’s short, and fun. Oddly (or not) I remember the story, but nothing of the poetry. I could go and get the book and quote you some, but I think I’ll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>Oh, except to say, of course, this is an ancient work, and Tolkien also did a cover version of it. But I expect you knew that.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>There is a solution to one of the great constitutional questions of our age, and I have it.
<p>Not, I might add, the question of making parliament more representative (that’s actually quite an easy one, and we even had a referendum on making it a bit better in this parliament, but we voted the wrong way). Nor indeed the one triggered by the Scottish referendum. It&rsquo;s not even the most basic problem of our constitution, though I&rsquo;ll answer that in passing: write it down.</p>
<p>No, I’m speaking of the problem of the head of state. Now it seems to me to be uncontentious to say that we need to move from a hereditary system to an elected one. The existence of a hereditary element to the government of a democracy is anathema; this is plain.</p>
<p>But if you suggest this to many (perhaps still most) British citizens,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> they will speak of a great affection for the Queen; maybe for the monarchy as an institution; and for the pageantry, and how great it is for tourism. Plus they’d point to recent less-than-impressive examples of US presidents, and say something like, “I wouldn’t want President Tony Blair.&quot;
Well, I could argue against any or all of those. But there’s no need to. Here’s the thing: as soon as we want to, we could switch to having an elected head of state, <em>without</em> losing any of the positives there, or introducing the negatives.</p>
<p>Well, we’d have to lose the Queen; the actual, current one, Elizabeth II. But that’s no problem: there won’t be any serious talk of change in her lifetime anyway. And probably not in Charlie’s for that matter.
But at some point in the future we could have an elected head of state, and still keep the monarchy, the pageantry, and the palaces.</p>
<p>How? We just redefine the words “monarch”, “king”, and “queen”.</p>
<p>We redefine them to be the title of the elected head of state in the UK. We elect one every few years — four, six, eight, it doesn’t really matter — <em>and we keep everything else exactly the same</em>.</p>
<p>Because of course, we’re a constitutional monarchy. The monarch has no real power, officially,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> except to ask the leader of the party with most seats at a general election to form a government.</p>
<p>The rest is window-dressing: pageantry and symbolism. The individual doing the job could as easily be one chosen by the electorate as one assigned the task by chance of birth.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Sure, such a person would be a president — a powerless president — in all but name. But I’ve come to the conclusion that the name is — to a lot of people, at least — what matters. Or at least that the concept referred to by the name <em>does</em> matter to many.</p>
<p>We would let the Windsors live on in reasonable splendour, in some of the Royal Palaces. We would only require one — and realistically it should probably be Buckingham Palace — to be the official residence of the new monarch. The others would still be owned by the state, of course, but the descendants of the last hereditary monarch would be allowed to live in them for a few generations at least.</p>
<p>Now, what sort of person would stand for election to a position with a fair amount of responsibility (state visits, and so on) and very little power? I don’t know, but that would work out over time. The principle works well enough in countries like Germany, where the president — yes, Germany has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Germany">a president</a>; who knew? — has a similar status to that of our elected monarch — and gets to live in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Palace_%28Germany%29">state-owned palace</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one power that the monarch does have is being the entity to whom members of the armed forces, the police, and indeed, MPs, take an oath. But even that wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. Those oaths are worded something like, &ldquo;to Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors.&rdquo; The new, elected monarch would indeed be the &ldquo;successor&rdquo; of the last hereditary one.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_monarchy">It turns out</a>, not surprisingly, that this idea has been thought of before. There don’t appear to have been many examples of it, and slightly disturbingly, one of the few examples of one that’s currently in use is the Vatican. But in that case the Pope is head of state, head of government, and sole executive power; an elected dictator-for-life, in fact (and by a tiny, restricted electorate). My version would be much more limited in what they could do. And they wouldn’t think they had a direct line to anything more supernatural than the prime minister’s office.</p>
<p>When looking into the matter, I also found <a href="http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1536459">this forum discussion</a> wherein people keep saying things like, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a contradiction in terms: monarch <em>means</em> hereditary ruler&hellip;&rdquo; Do they forget that English is a changing language, always growing, expanding, shifting meanings? If we want to redefine a monarch as being an elected person, we can.</p>
<p>Oh, and hey — there’ll be nothing to stop a Windsor standing for election. You never know, they&rsquo;d probably win. But at least then they&rsquo;d have a mandate.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I read the original version this a few years back, when my sister bought it for my son. It was good, very interesting and informative. And I wanted to read this expanded edition when it first came out. Although it’s called “The Final Chapter”, as if it were purely an additional piece, it contains both the original book and the new work — which is a lot more than just a “chapter”. But it was always just ferociously expensive. </p>
<p>Like, old-school hardback price for a large-format paperback. And it never seemed to come down, or come to in a smaller-size, mass-market paperback edition. So it always just felt too daunting.</p>
<p>Then eventually I saw it was on Kindle for what seemed like a more reasonable price, so I grabbed it.</p>
<p>It’s nothing more or less than an edited, long, email conversation between Davies and Cook. Sometimes several emails a day, in which Cook asks Davies questions about the latter’s writing process and other aspects of making <cite>Doctor Who</cite> (and to a lesser extent <cite>Torchwood</cite> and <cite>The Sarah Jane Adventures</cite>).</p>
<p>And it’s absolutely fascinating read, especially if you’re at all interested in the creative process, in how writers write, and so on. It also feels a bit like you’re eavesdropping on someone else’s conversation at times, Somehow that’s not a problem, though. After all, it’s an interesting conversation, and we’ve been invited to listen in.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Davies enjoys sharing his thoughts on his process in this way, and it sort of makes you wonder why he doesn’t blog. But then, if he had been writing these emails as blog posts at the time, he couldn’t possibly have shared as much as he did with Cook, and with us several years after the events.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This is the one that's won them all: BSFA (jointly), Clarke, Nebula, and more recently, the Hugo Award. Never before has a single book had such a sweeping effect on the world of SF awards.
<p>And does it deserve them all? Does it live up to the effusive reaction of the community?</p>
<p>Err, well&hellip; no, not really.</p>
<p>Which is not to say it&rsquo;s bad. In a sense, nothing <em>could</em> live up that level of praise.</p>
<p>However, my personal problem with it &ndash; at least at first &ndash; was this: I like my super-intelligent spaceship minds to be the good guys. To be part of, and defending, Utopia. In short, I want <a href="http://io9.com/354739/welcome-to-the-culture-the-galactic-civilization-that-iain-m-banks-built">The Culture</a>. And I guess I hoped that Ann Leckie might sort of take Banksie&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Obviously there wasn&rsquo;t much chance of that, and it isn&rsquo;t fair to judge the book on those terms.</p>
<p>So, back to its own terms. In any case, these super-intelligent spaceship minds aren&rsquo;t <em>necessarily</em> bad guys; but they&rsquo;re in the service of a pretty unpleasant empire. Though things get ambiguous. And interesting. And of course, there&rsquo;s the gender-blindness of the viewpoint character, which is great. So yeah, it was fun, I enjoyed it, it goes to some interesting places, and it sets things up nicely for a series.</p>
<p>Oh, god, a series. Does nobody write books in <em>ones</em> any more? I was just looking at the current crop of so-called &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; deals on Kindle. There were quite a lot of books for crazy-cheap prices. Except&hellip; there weren&rsquo;t really that many if you <em>count a series as one</em>.</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon, folks, write a book that doesn&rsquo;t have a sequel, hey?</p>
<p>But I digress. Go read about <cite>Ancillary Justice</cite>: you&rsquo;ll find reviews of it all over the place. Then go and read it. It&rsquo;s great.</p></body></html></p>

  This week I got a demo of Photoshop running inside Chrome, and while it was really interesting, some of my assumptions were faulty. It turns out that when Adobe says Photoshop is a “streaming app,” they mean it—it’s much more like screen sharing than native software. Photoshop runs remotely on a Windows-based server, and video of the app’s interface streams to the Chrome browser.

			 <html><body><p>Unlike Stephen King’s book of the same title, this isn’t exactly “a manual of the craft.” You won’t find much about the writing side of writing here; nothing about crafting sentences, forming paragraphs, developing characters or plots.</p>
<p>It’s less about the craft of writing than about the life of a writer; and it shares with King’s eponym the part-memoir approach. Kennedy spends a lot of time describing how writing has been bad for her health in various ways, and how in turn her pathological fear of flying has made the writing life more difficult, (travelling to North America by ship for a signing tour) for example.</p>
<p>The largest and most entertaining part of it was originally published as blog entries on The Guardian’s site.</p>
<p>It’s very good. And not from the book, but with <cite>Doctor Who</cite> back (and nearly finished) you should read her <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/11/peter-capaldi-doctor-who-children">meditation on it and on the state of Britain</a>.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Always good to get a new JK Rowling, of course, whatever name she's using. I sometimes wonder if she's got loads of other things out there, under other as-yet-undisclosed pseudonyms; probably not, though.
<p>Anyway, in the second Cormoran Strike book, we have more of the same sort of thing we had in the first. This time it&rsquo;s set in the world of publishing, with all sorts of rivalries between more and less successful authors, agents, editors and publishers. &ldquo;Write what you know&rdquo;, Jo.</p>
<p>But can such rivalries drive someone to murder? It seems so.</p>
<p>My main, and very minor, complaint about this was that there wasn&rsquo;t enough of sidekick Robin in it, I felt.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many of these she&rsquo;s planning to write, but sooner or later Cormoran has to meet &ndash; and presumably solve a crime for, or concerning &ndash; his estranged rock-star father. who is a recurring offstage character.</p></body></html></p>

We <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2013/05/21/the-third-person-sanctimonious/">disagreed over <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite></a>.
<p>Anyway, the card had a post-it stuck inside, with some writing on it that I couldn&rsquo;t quite make out. Di wrote, &ldquo;Been trying to get this for you for ages&hellip; can you guess who it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was slow to realise that the &ldquo;who&rdquo; referred to the writing on the post-it. But she also said there was a clue on the back of the card.</p>
<p>On the back she&rsquo;d written &ldquo;devilgate.org&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The post-it looks like this:</p>

<p>And I read it to say, &ldquo;To Martin. <a href="http://www.suziquatro.com/">Suzi Quatro</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I mean, if it says that it makes sense <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/04/10/why-devilgate/">considering my origin story</a>; otherwise, not so much.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I'm now so far behind in posting these that I'm just going to put very brief notes up for most of them.
<p>As a sequel to the excellent <cite>London Falling</cite> this suffers slightly from what feels a bit like middle-book-of-trilogy syndrome; though I believe Cornell intends this to be an ongoing series, rather than a trilogy.</p>
<p>That said, there is an overarching mystery, which we must hope will be resolved over the course of several books. And at that point, maybe he&rsquo;ll stop. But the actual story here is perhaps slight compared to the origin stories of the first one, and the horror that Quill and his wife, in particular, experienced.</p>
<p>A mysterious ghostly figure &ndash; invisible to all who don&rsquo;t have The Sight, of course &ndash; is killing people in London. There appears to be little to connect them at first, but graffiti at some of the scenes suggests there might be a link to Jack the Ripper. Has his ghost come back and this time gone after rich white men? Or is it something else entirely?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun read, despite my reservations above, with some amusing reference to fandom, and the terrible, terrible abuse of a giant of the fantasy genre.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>It seems like a curious choice for the Liberal Democrats to have their national conference in Glasgow this year, what with everything else that’s been going on in Scotland. I don’t think they’re very popular there.</p>
<p>Then again, they’re not very popular anywhere.</p>
<p>Back before the the coalition, when the Lib Dems were the third party, they always spoke in favour of coalition government. They always said that they would work with anyone if it they ever held the balance of power.</p>
<p>Then when it looked there was going to be a hung parliament, and when there actually was, they still said that they would work with either Labour or the Tories in order to bring a government into being.</p>
<p>The trouble is, no-one really believed them.</p>
<p>OK, I can only really speak for myself; but I’m probably not that unusual. The Lib Dems were always seen as being closer to Labour than to the Tories. There was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib%E2%80%93Lab_pact">Lib-Lab pact</a> back in the seventies. And all through the New Labour years, they were generally seen as being further left than Labour.</p>
<p>So when they held the balance of power in 2010, it was obvious — so we all thought, I say — that they would work with Labour, rather than the Tories.</p>
<p>Alas, it was not to be. Imagine how different the country might be now if Clegg had swung the right way back then. The country wouldn’t have been half-destroyed by Osbourne’s “austerity” measures. (I mean, <em>really</em>: haven’t they learned by now that you don’t cut public spending in a recession?)</p>
<p>Of course, there have been some good things during the coalition: marriage equality; the Scottish referendum (irrespective of how it turned out, Cameron agreed to it). There was even — if you recall — a referendum on electoral reform. Remember that?</p>
<p>No, me neither. It was a fix (since it got voted down), but I don’t recall how. Oh, yes wait: the anti-reform camp <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/05/03/lets-all-say-yes/">made a big thing</a> of how much more complex than first-past-the-post the alternative vote (AV) system would be. When in fact it’s <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kk2lZ.jpg">quite simple</a>. And I guess they got the friendly media working against it.</p>
<p>Anyway, now they’ve been all but wiped out in yesterday’s by election. The worst thing about that is that UKIP seem to be in danger of replacing them as the third party.</p>
<p>Scary but interesting times.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Sometimes you're thinking about writing a blog post and then you write a long comment on someone else's post that contains most of what you were planning on saying. So I wrote this as a comment on <a href="https://reprog.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/but-mike-what-do-you-think-of-the-new-doctor-who/">The Reinvigorated Programmer</a>, and thought I should repeat it here.
<p>The background: Mike, the Programmer and <cite>Doctor Who</cite> fan, if that&rsquo;s not too tautologous, was complaining about the latest episode, &ldquo;Kill the Moon&rdquo;. Now, I didn&rsquo;t think it was all that bad, as these things go, but I knew that other people, on Facebook and elsewhere, have both complained about it and praised it. Which seems to be par for the course this series (and maybe every series). Anyway, I had some thoughts on the matter, and put them like this.</p>
<p>I was disappointed that they didn&rsquo;t put in at least a handwavy explanation of the extra mass (which they could have done: posit highly-effecient energy-to-mass conversion, and the sun). But as people have said in other places, you&rsquo;re accepting a time-travelling, dimensionally-transcendental blue box, and a regenerating Time Lord, so&hellip;?</p>
<p>As to the biology of the creature&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s <em>alien</em>. Possibly one of a kind. Why <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> it lay an egg as soon as it hatched? Remembering that &ldquo;egg&rdquo; and &ldquo;hatch&rdquo; are only our Terracentrist words for something entirely other.</p>
<p>Indeed, that could be exactly why the creature&rsquo;s mass spikes in the last few years or months of its dormant cycle: it&rsquo;s forming the new &ldquo;egg&rdquo; so it itself will be ready to &ldquo;hatch&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And by default it would be in the same orbit, unless something displaced it.</p>
<p>But yes, while you can argue all that, the story would have been improved if it had included at least a nod to those points. And they should have got their sums right.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s something bigger going on across this whole series. It&rsquo;s the development of Clara&rsquo;s character, and Danny&rsquo;s secret, and everything. It&rsquo;s more: I just have a feeling that there&rsquo;s <em>something else</em> behind it all. Maybe I&rsquo;ve just been trained to expect a season arc since the Bad Wolf, but&hellip; there&rsquo;s definitely something going on.</p>
<p>And Missy and the promised land, of course.</p>
<p>Someone somewhere suggested that maybe the whole series is taking place in a <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Miniscope">miniscope</a>, since the Doc mentioned them in episode 3. I hope it&rsquo;s more than that.</p></body></html></p>

<p>On the other hand, I can’t help being a little bit pleased that we’re all going to stay part of one country.</p>
<p>The Westminster politicians this morning are promising more devolution for Scotland, and for all the countries of the UK. Now we have to get hold of some of the energy, the political engagement that Scotland showed, and hold them to it.</p>

It goes on to say he “appeared to declare his support for Scottish independence”. That “appeared” is key, because the lack of punctuation and capitalisation in Andy’s tweet actually allows at least a couple of interpretations:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Huge day for Scotland today! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. excited to see the outcome. lets do this!
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <cite>Telegraph</cite> is clearly reading that as “‘No’-Campaign negativity…” The negativity from the “No” campaign, in other words.</p>
<p>But you could read it simply as “[there has been] no campaign negativity…” In other words, the absence of negativity in the campaigning (by either side or both) has left him with a positive view of the referendum.</p>
<p>I’d guess that the <cite>Telegraph</cite>‘s opinion is correct. But it just goes to show… if he could place a quote character like he can place a tennis ball, it would all be perfectly clear.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Despite my positive-seeming thoughts and comments over the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/09/05/oncoming-independence/">last</a> few <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/09/10/panic-in-westminster/">days</a>, I can't help but feeling today that -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas#The_.22wave_speech.22">to paraphrase, if not exactly quote, Hunter S Thompson</a> -- the wave has begun to break, if not roll back.
<p>And it&rsquo;s all going to be so close that, whatever way the people of Scotland finally vote, they clearly are not of one mind on the matter. You begin to see why some votes require things like a two-thirds majority; or even why the 1979 referendum included the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_devolution_referendum,_1979#.2240.25.22_rule">40% rule</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(Though again, that was not vote on independence, but on Scotland having an assembly. Who could vote against <em>that</em>, you&rsquo;d have to wonder?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>)</p>
<p>What has brought on this change, you&rsquo;re almost certainly asking? More polls, more fearmongering headlines, and just a sense that the impetus has been lost. The yes campaign peaked too soon, you could say.</p>
<p>But, there&rsquo;s still another week to go. Anything could happen.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><h2>A Scot abroad</h2>
<p>For at least a couple of years people have been asking me what I think about the Scottish independence question. At least since the <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Government/concordats/Referendum-on-independence">Edinburgh Agreement</a>, I suppose. People down here in London, that is.</p>
<p>I, of course, don&rsquo;t have a vote, as I don&rsquo;t live in Scotland &ndash; indeed, I&rsquo;ve lived in London for more than half my life. But we don&rsquo;t stop being from the place we come from, and we don&rsquo;t stop caring about it; so it&rsquo;s reasonable to suppose I&rsquo;d have an opinion.</p>
<p>And I do. In fact, I have a whole range of them, at different times. Sometimes I have more than one at the same time. Which is partly why I haven&rsquo;t written about the independence referendum here before now.</p>
<p>I have been <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/05/25/floating/">scathing in the past</a> about people who give their political opinion as &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly what I am, what I have been for the last several years: &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Back in the 70s, when there was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_devolution_referendum,_1979">original referendum</a>, I would have voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; at the drop of a thistle, had I been old enough &ndash; indeed, I did, in the mock version we had at school. My reasoning in those days was purely based on emotion, and tied in to football and being the underdog.</p>
<p>In the years, the decades since then, if you had asked me whether I thought Scotland should be independent, I would probably have said yes. Most likely, most of the time. And though I stopped caring about football (and let&rsquo;s face it, Scotland stopped being anything like a force in football), it was still an emotional reaction, still about national identity, about the fact that we as a country felt overwhelmed, repressed by the relative behemoth to the south.</p>
<p>At some point, of course, I moved there. London called and I answered yes. It didn&rsquo;t change who I was, how I felt about Scotland. But it did, perhaps, give me a new way to think about how I felt about England.</p>
<p>Going back to the football/underdog business, it was always an us-and-them thing: we Scots always saw ourselves as different from, in opposition to, the English. And yet, when I met English people, they were perfectly fine &ndash; or a mixture of fine and not, of good and bad, of interesting and boring: the same as people in Scotland, or anywhere.</p>
<p>Plus, we were all British, linked by citizenship, by the NHS, by the BBC; by our shared history of literature, music, art.</p>
<p>(Though it was and remains (and always will be) annoying when people say &ldquo;England&rdquo; or &ldquo;English&rdquo; when they mean &ldquo;Britain&rdquo; or &ldquo;British&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not hard; the difference is quite clear.)</p>
<h2>Constitutional matters</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s something I left out of that list of linkages above, of course. Scotland and England were joined by two unions. The Acts of Union, in which both parliaments legislated to become one parliament, is the more important one, and the one that may be overturned on the 18th of September. But before that there was the Union of the Crowns, in which Scotland very kindly agreed that England could share its monarch.</p>
<p>Now, if they were going to dissolve that one (and I had a vote) I&rsquo;d vote yes in a heartbeat &ndash; as long, of course, that separating the crowns meant Scotland moving to a democratically-elected head of state (or none; they&rsquo;re not strictly necessary).</p>
<p>Yes, I would happily be a citizen of the Republic of Scotland.</p>
<p>But that was never on the table, of course. I don&rsquo;t know whether Alex Salmond or any of the other SNP luminaries are republicans &ndash; some of them must be &ndash; but they had to keep the bluenoses on side. That&rsquo;s Rangers fans, in case you don&rsquo;t know; protestants; loyalists, unionists.</p>
<p>It must be one of the strangest states, actually: to be a Scottish person who believes in independence (and so is against the Union); but who also looks to the Scottish protestant/Rangers-supporting tradition, and is in favour of the Union of Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>Do such people exist? They must, really. Indeed, I saw a video a few months back of a Rangers fan who was so pro-Union, so anti-independence that he was wearing an England football shirt (yet he was undeniably Scottish), and saying that if the vote went yes, he&rsquo;d move to England.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an unusual reaction, that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmGjiokfQ2A">Here we go</a>. &ldquo;You can stick your independence up your arse,&rdquo; apparently.</p>
<p>But on constitutional changes: I frequently find myself frustratedly wondering, how can we be asking people to vote on such matters without this kind of thing being decided first? Shouldn&rsquo;t a new constitution have been drafted, the discussions on currency and European unions held, decisions made <em>in advance</em>? So that people would go to the polls knowing exactly what they were voting for or against.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that make more sense?</p>
<p>I did hear someone on the radio saying essentially that my thinking was foolish, because there are some things that can only be decided after a yes vote. But I don&rsquo;t think he really made the point.</p>
<h2>The original referendum, Labour, and Thatcher</h2>
<p>In reading up on various things Scottish for this piece,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I discovered that part of the fallout from the seventies referendum that I linked to above was the Thatcher government. The &ldquo;40% Rule&rdquo;, which caused the referendum to fail (the majority had to comprise 40% of the electorate) was brought in by a Labour MP&rsquo;s amendment; and when it fell, according to the Wikipedia article:</p>
<blockquote>
  the government's decision to abandon devolution for Scotland led the Scottish National Party to withdraw its support for the government. A subsequent vote of no confidence led to the resignation of the Callaghan government, and an election was called.
</blockquote>
<p>That election was the one that got Thatcher elected.</p>
<p>Maybe she&rsquo;d have been elected at the next election whenever it happened; but maybe not. And I can&rsquo;t help but think that the Labour party has a disturbing sideline in betraying the people it should be serving, and this &ndash; and the current Labour party&rsquo;s staunchly pro-union stance &ndash; is an example of it. Labour should support democratic freedom and the right of small countries to govern themselves. Trouble is, so many Labour MPs are Scottish, and they can see power at Westminster slipping further and further from their grasp if they don&rsquo;t have the effect of all those Scottish seats.</p>
<p>I can understand that, though. that aspect of potential independence worries me, too: selfishly, I want to keep Scotland as part of the UK because I fear the effect of it leaving and us losing the balancing power of its more left-wing nature. Without Scotland, the rest of the UK could be doomed to near-permanent Tory governments. Or worse; UKIP along with the extremely anti-EU rump of the Tories when they split (it <em>will</em> happen, the only questions are when, and how many MPs will go).</p>
<p>Being stuck in an RoUK that votes to leave the EU? That is distinctly unappealing</p>
<p>Just as a minor aside, something I had totally forgotten was that the 1979 referendum wasn&rsquo;t for independence: it was only to have an assembly, which sounds a lot like the Scottish Parliament of today.</p>
<h2>The Rest?</h2>
<p>I used the term &ldquo;RoUK&rdquo; above. That&rsquo;s the way people have been referring to the &ldquo;rest of the UK&rdquo;, meaning what&rsquo;s left of the UK after Scotland leaves. But I&rsquo;m not so sure that there should really be any such thing.</p>
<p>See, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland came into existence when the Republic of Ireland got its independence from Britain, leaving Northern Ireland still connected. But the &ldquo;Great Britain&rdquo; part (as a political entity, as opposed to the island): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain">that came into existence with the Acts of Union</a>.</p>
<p>Repeal those Acts and arguably Great Britain ceases to exist as a political entity; so how can the UK exist after that happens?</p>
<p>So rather than debating whether an independent Scotland will be able to remain in the EU will have to rejoin it from outside, we should be discussing what, exactly, will be left if Scotland leaves the union.</p>
<h2>Salmond and the anti-personality cult</h2>
<p>It disturbs me how many Scots seem to be basing their decision around personality. &ldquo;Salmond&rsquo;s a wanker&rdquo;, and all that kind of thing. If the vote goes yes, Salmond can retire (arguably the SNP will no longer have a reason to exist, in fact). But anyway, governments change, they can be voted out; people die. It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re voting to make Salmond president for life. Rather, you&rsquo;re voting for the type of country that your children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren will inherit.</p>
<h2>Other voices</h2>
<p>Before I end, some other pieces that I&rsquo;ve been reading on the matter. As <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/irvine-welsh-the-scots-poll-can-give-hope-to-the-left-across-britain-9559111.html">Irvine Welsh has said</a>, this is a great time for political engagement in Scotland.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> And <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/comment/columnists/why-scottish-independence-would-help-england-to-rediscover-its-radical-heart.25189347">Billy Bragg adds</a> that it might be good politically for England too.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://upholdingenglishhonour.com/2014/07/16/dear-eddie-izzard-and-friends-please-dont-go-on-please-listen-to-why-its-ok-for-us-english-to-let-scotland-go/">here&rsquo;s a blog by an English guy</a> who favours Scottish independence. He also favours English and Welsh independence, it seems: the complete breakup of the UK; just look at his masthead. His blog has the slightly disturbing title of &ldquo;Upholding English Honour&rdquo;, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the little Englander that name might imply.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.millarworld.tv/index.php?/topic/104960-i-keep-seeing-this-disinfo-on-scotlands-voting-record/">Mark Millar is undecided</a>, but calls for better behaviour all round in the debate. And <a href="http://jackdeighton.co.uk/2014/07/26/scotlands-literature-and-scottish-independence/">Jack Deighton considers the effect that the referendum might have on Scottish literature</a>.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, of course, my opinion means nothing. But here it is anyway. If I were living in Scotland, I&rsquo;m now fairly sure that I&rsquo;d be voting yes. And speaking as an attached outsider, I&rsquo;m coming round to hoping that the vote goes that way; if only to see what happens next.</p>
<p>After all, it could be the beginning of a great adventure.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I’ve read pretty much everything by HST that’s been published in book form, but I hadn’t read this, his sole novel, until now.</p>
<p>He wrote it before he started to get successful as a journalist, as I understand it, so it’s interesting that it’s a story _about_ a journalist, or several. And they’re hard-drinking ones at that. But that kind of goes without saying.</p>
<p>As the novel starts it is 1959 and the first-person narrator is wanderer, unsure of what he wants to do with his life. He is leaving New York for Puerto Rico, to take up a post on the English-language paper there.</p>
<p>The story charts the ups and downs of his life over the next few months, along with various other people, mainly involved with the paper. It’s an entertaining enough read, but largely inconsequential as a story. You couldn’t really say that the character has grown or developed much by the end, and while we get some insight into the way the US was interacting with Puerto Rico at the time (unspoilt beaches being sold to developers to build luxury hotel complexes, that kind of thing), I wouldn’t say you get a great sense of Puerto Rico itself.</p>
<p>It’s mainly interesting for showing some early flashes of the writing style that Thompson would develop over the subsequent years into his signature gonzo style. For example: </p>
<p>&gt; They ran the whole gamut from genuine talents and honest men, to degenerates and hopeless losers who could barely write a postcard–loons and fugitives and dangerous drunks</p>
<p>Not up there with <cite>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</cite>, obviously, but you can see the beginnings of that style.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This is considered to be one of the seminal works of alternative history; often mentioned alongside <cite>The Man in the High Castle</cite>
<p>Instead of the Axis forces winning the Second World War, as in Dick&rsquo;s classic, the break point is Queen Elizabeth I being assassinated, which leads to the Spanish invading England (Scotland&rsquo;s situation is never mentioned) via the Armada, and so the Catholic church becomes the dominant force in the world (at least Europe and the Americas) for centuries.</p>
<p>Most of which is told in a short prologue. The body of the novel (which a I believe is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fix-up">fix-up</a>, and certainly feels like it) consists of four short stories with some overlapping characters, which tell the tale of how rebellion against the Church comes to England.</p>
<p>I quite enjoyed it, but was put off at the start, because frankly the nuances of the workings of a traction engine running the freight across the country through a frozen winter night, were not all that interesting. In fact, it was downright boring. Would it have been less so if it were about a spaceship, instead of a traction engine? Obviously; anything is more fun with spaceships in it. But that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>In fact, the point is largely our old friend &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t automatically hold with that myself; there are plenty of examples of good stories working by &ldquo;telling.&rdquo; The problem is that if you rely entirely or mainly on telling, it&rsquo;s easy to lose either or both of the characters and the action. Certainly you can tell us what&rsquo;s happening; but it&rsquo;ll have a much stronger impact if you make us feel it.</p>
<p>The second section, for example, starts with a young man bleeding to death in the snow, and then jumps back to his training as a signaller. A much more gripping way to handle things.</p>
<p>The time period appears to be from around the sixties through to the eighties, but the Church&rsquo;s dead hand has so stifled technological progress that semaphore and steam remain the height of technology.</p>
<p>And there are fairies; old English magic that the Church hasn&rsquo;t quite managed to wipe out. But they are kind of abandoned after the second (maybe third) story.</p>
<p>Anyway, after that initial hump it was enjoyable enough, but it&rsquo;s a pleasingly slim book. If it had been the size of a modern novel, I&rsquo;m not sure it would have held my interest.</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>(Is there such a thing as a &ldquo;postamble&rdquo;, I wonder?)</p>
<p>After reading the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/04/14/the-state-of-me-by-nasim-marie-jafry-books-2014-4/">previous novel</a> I decided it was high time I caught up on some short-story reading. I had several months of <cite>Interzone</cite> backlogged, for example.</p>
<p>Trouble is, it seems that short stories have lost their way.</p>
<p>I know, that&rsquo;s ridiculously sweeping. Obviously any such perceived change is far more likely to be in me, than in <em>all recent short stories</em>. And yet, I feel sure that short stories <em>used</em> to be more interesting. So could it be an age thing? Perhaps, but let me first describe what I think it is that&rsquo;s wrong with them.</p>
<p>In short: nothing happens.</p>
<p>In slightly longer: too many of what people are presenting (and selling) as stories are in fact not really stories at all. They are little more then scenes, vignettes at best. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with such pieces of writing <em>per se</em>, of course. They can be powerful, evocative, enjoyable&hellip; but they&rsquo;re not <em>stories</em>, it seems to me.</p>
<p>In a story, something has to happen; something or someone has to change. And too often in my recent reading, they don&rsquo;t. Or if they do, it&rsquo;s in a way or to a degree that just doesn&rsquo;t  compel, enthuse, <em>excite</em>.</p>
<h2>The <cite>BSFA Awards 2013</cite> Booklet</h2>
<p>I should discuss some specifics, and with the recent<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> announcement of the <a href="http://www.bsfa.co.uk/bsfa-award-winners-announced/">BSFA Awards</a>, what better stories to pick than the four that were nominated? The BSFA very helpfully curates and distributes a booklet containing all the nominated fiction (also reproductions of the nominated artworks, and this year for the first time, extracts from the non-fiction nominees). Conveniently, this booklet arrived during my short-story-reading period, and I read it straight away, to give me the chance to actually vote, for a change.</p>
<p>How disappointing it was.</p>
<p>By now we know that the lead story in the booklet, &ldquo;Spin&rdquo;, by Nina Allan, won the short fiction award. So I&rsquo;ll deal with it last.</p>
<h2>"Selkie Stories are for Losers", by Sofia Samatar.</h2>
<p>Our unnamed first-person narrator hates stories of <a href="http://www.orkneyjar.com/folklore/selkiefolk/">selkies</a>, and swears she&rsquo;ll never tell one. Why this might be something that she is called upon or tempted to do seems to be related to her forebears: American, her family background is Norwegian. She grew up with selkie stories. As time goes on there is the suggestion that her mother is one of the changeling creatures.</p>
<p>However, the story is good because of the characterisation. It&rsquo;s the shortest of the four, but has the strongest, most interesting characters. Well, character: our selkie-story-hating narrator. As the story starts she is working as a waitress and falling in love with a co-worker, Mona. And from there it&rsquo;s a love story with a slightly-weird background, and always the sense that something related to the selkie myths is going to happen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good review of it <a href="http://everythingisnice.wordpress.com/2014/02/14/selkie-stories-are-for-losers-by-sofia-somatar-2013-bsfa-award-short-story-club/">on Martin Petto&rsquo;s blog</a>, actually. I pretty much agree with that.</p>
<h2>"Saga's Children", by EJ Swift</h2>
<p>This is an odd story about a solar-system-famous astronaut, Saga, who has had three children by three different fathers in different places. She took no part nor much interest in their upbringing; and none of them knew the others existed until they were adults.</p>
<p>Saga summons them to meet her at a station in orbit around Ceres, and something happens.</p>
<p>But not much, as I was complaining above. The telling is unusual: throughout, the children refer to themselves as &ldquo;we&rdquo;, but when they discuss their various careers, for example, they list all three of their names; none of them refers to themselves as &ldquo;I&rdquo;. In other words, it is first-person plural.</p>
<p>But this has a distancing effect; we don&rsquo;t really get to know any of the three. And a mystery happens and is not resolved, and we&rsquo;re left none the wiser as to Saga&rsquo;s motivations, or what the children will do.</p>
<p>I should just let Martin Petto do this for me, because <a href="http://everythingisnice.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/sagas-children-by-ej-swift-2013-bsfa-award-short-story-club/">his take on this story</a>. too, is very accurate.</p>
<h2>"Boat in Shadows, Crossing", by Tori Truslow</h2>
<p>Maybe I should just let <a href="http://everythingisnice.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/boat-in-shadows-crossing-by-tori-truslow-2013-bsfa-award-short-story-club/">Martin deal with this one, too</a>. On the other hand, he is annoyed by it in ways that didn&rsquo;t bother me. It was, in fact, my favourite of the four, and the one I voted for first in the BSFA Awards (&ldquo;Selkie Stories are for Losers&rdquo; second, and no others).</p>
<p>Why was this the best? An intriguing, mysterious environment, an immediately-compelling narrator, a problem to solve, a world &ndash; or at least a city &ndash; to change.</p>
<h2>"Spin", by Nina Allan</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A retelling of the Arachne myth&rdquo;, we are told. It turns out that I didn&rsquo;t know the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachne">Arachne myth</a>, and that makes a difference.</p>
<p>We are in something like modern-day Greece &ndash; people use iPads, for example &ndash; but time is out of joint: the currency is the Drachma, and there are suggestions that ancient events actually happened within living memory. And the protagonist&rsquo;s father is a dyer, and all mentions of his trade imply that modern chemistry is all but unknown.</p>
<p>We start with the protagonist leaving the family home &ndash; running away, it feels like, though she is an adult &ndash; and making a new life for herself in another town. She gets a job, and practises her art of weaving in her spare time.</p>
<p>A mysterious old woman speaks to her enigmatically.</p>
<p>Her art soon earns her success and some recognition.</p>
<p>But some people &ndash; one woman in particular, with a  sick son &ndash; think that she has a power, that her images can influence the future, if not cause it. It emerges that her mother was executed (or murdered) because she was believed to be some kind of witch.</p>
<p>She strikes up a relationship of sorts with the sick son (who may not be very sick at all), and we think we begin to see how things are going.</p>
<p>But then the old mystery woman is back and our hero is looking at some spiders on a bush and feeling weird and it&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>What? What the hell just happened?</p>
<p>It turns out that Arachne was a weaver who claimed to be (or was) better than Athena, and got turned into a spider as a punishment. So there you are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve liked several of Nina Allan&rsquo;s stories before this, but this one just doesn&rsquo;t cut it for me; and I find it hard to believe that in all the science fiction (and fantasy) in all the world, there wasn&rsquo;t a better short story published in 2013.</p>
<p>(My namesake Petto didn&rsquo;t review this one, but instead posted a link to a review of it that no longer exists.)</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just grumpy cos on the rare occasion I&rsquo;ve get round to submitting my own stuff, it&rsquo;s been rejected.</p>
<p>Anyway, there we go. Back to novels.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I’m not in the market for a new pair of headphones. My venerable <a href="http://www.head-fi.org/products/sennheiser-hd-450-headphones">Sennheiser HD450s</a> are still doing fine for over-the-head use, and the same brand have provided me with a series of earbuds for mobile use. But I tried a pair of Beats by Dre phones in an HMV the other day, just to see what all the fuss was about.</p>
<p>They looked pretty good, felt comfortable, and sounded great. But the price!</p>
<p>Apparently Apple <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/28/Apple-buys-beats-dr-dre-music-streaming">bought Beats</a> more for the streaming service than the phones. That makes sense: if they’d wanted a headphone company they’d have gone for Sennheiser, obviously (and if they cared about earphones in general they wouldn’t have made horrible ones for years).</p>
<p>But you’d think that if they wanted a streaming service, they’d have gone for Spotify, which is surely more established.</p>
<p>So I suspect the truth may include a combination of the two, plus a degree of cool cachet, in what is perhaps a demographic that they don’t currently reach.</p>
<p>Either way, if the next iPhone or Mac comes with a cool pair of phones (unlikely though that may be) I won’t be unhappy.</p>

			 <p>I usually post before elections. This time I didn’t get round to it.</p>
<p>The results of the European parliament elections were horrendous, of course. But one slightly good thing may come out of it all.</p>
<p>IMHO the single biggest contribution to UKIP’s success is the fact that Nigel Farage was never off the BBC in the last few months. More appearances on <cite>Question Time</cite> than anyone else, for example. Constantly consulted on the radio about anything even vaguely connected to Europe or immigration (or anything else, it seemed).</p>
<p>In short, it’s the fact that the BBC treated them like a mainstream party that has caused — or at least helped — them to almost become one.</p>
<p>I see a close parallel with the way they give climate-change deniers equal time with climatologists whenever there’s an environment story; the intent being balance, but the effect being to give undue weight to the views of a tiny minority.</p>
<p>Here, though, they went far beyond that point, to where I feel they were guilty of violating their mandated requirement to show balance.</p>
<p>So the potential good outcome: at least people of the right can no longer say that the BBC has a left-wing, pro-Europe bias.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

			 <html><body><p>Another from the "never posted" series. Again, I don't know why I didn't post it. It seems pretty finished. It's also wildly out of date, stemming is it does from 2006. 2006! That's eight years ago now! Where the hell does the time go?
<p>Anyway, the original piece follows.</p>
</p><blockquote>
  Religion is much in discussion at the moment, it seems, and atheism even more so.
<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury <a href="http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2006/10/27/archbishop-warns-of-dangers-of-banning-veils">has said that</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    the ideal of a society where no visible public signs of religion would be seen — no crosses around necks, no sidelocks, turbans or veils — is a politically dangerous one
  </blockquote>
<p>But no-one has been trying to do that.  True, there have recently been two cases in which employers have restricted what their staff can wear, with regard to items related to religions.  Now, whether employers should be able to insist on such restrictions is one question, and a valid one to be asked; but it&rsquo;s not something new, nor unique to religious clothes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not as if anyone other than British Airways has done anything to restrict the display of Christian symbols.  The woman in question there was in a uniformed occupation, and the cross violated the uniform code.  Case closed.  Do you think it would have been any different for a police officer or ambulance driver?  If you want to get the uniform rules in your job changed, speak to your employer, go through your union, or whatever: but keep the courts out of it.  Similarly if you are in a non-uniformed job with a dress code.</p>
<p>All of which is different from &ndash; almost orthogonal to &ndash; the case of Jack Straw asking Muslim women to remove their veils during a conversation (note: asking, not insisting; during a conversation, not forever).</p>
<p>I got the impression from the radio news this morning that the ArchieCant was trying to play the &ldquo;persecuted Christian&rdquo; card, railing against the overwhelming forces of our secular society.  But having scanned his <a href="http://rowanwilliams.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/638/both-crosses-and-veils-must-be-allowed-times-article">actual article</a>, I see that that is not quite so.  Rather, he is warning of the dangers of a society which only allows state-sanctioned religions to exist.  Fair point, but again, not something that anyone is suggesting in Britain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no excuse for a Christian leader to complain about his (and it is always &ldquo;his&rdquo;) religion&rsquo;s place in modern Britain (or, even more so, America).  The various Christian churches, and the church of England in particular, hold a remarkably privileged position in British public life, from the head of state being also the head of the church, through the tax-free status of religions, right up to the exclusively-religious nature of Radio 4&rsquo;s &lsquo;Thought for the Day&rsquo; (and that&rsquo;s not even mentioning the &lsquo;Daily Worship&rsquo; or the complete takeover from 8 on Sunday mornings).</p>
<p>Then the Education Minister Alan Johnson has changed the former intent of the government regarding allowing non-believers (or different-believers) into new &ldquo;faith&rdquo; schools.  Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I am utterly opposed to &ldquo;faith&rdquo; schools: one great thing that America gets right, in my opinion, is it&rsquo;s implementation of the separation of church and state that bans states from enforcing religious observation in schools, and I would happily see it removed from schools here.  But we are where we are, and if there are going to be new, state-funded schools that base part of their teaching on a religion, then I think that the worst thing possible would be for them to be <em>exclusively</em> pupilled by kids from families who are followers of that religion.</p>
<p>And remember I went exclusively to state Catholic schools in Scotland.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://devilgate.org/2014/04/14/the-state-of-me-by/">The State of Me, by Nasim Marie Jafry (Books 2014, 4)</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Well this is an interesting one. Nasim is an old friend. Or it might be more accurate to say she was the big sister of an old friend. She lived two doors down the road when I was growing up. Her younger brothers were both close friends of mine. A few weeks ago I came across some old email, and it made me think of them. I knew that Nasim had had a story or two published, so I googled her. Found <a href="http://velo-gubbed-legs.blogspot.co.uk/">her blog</a>, discovered she’d had a novel published, ordered it from Amazon, and here we are.
<p>In doing all this I got back in touch with her and with her brother, Yusuf, who I haven’t see in I don’t know how many years. So it’s all good.</p>
<p>But what about the book, I hear you ask?</p>
<p>Well, it’s not the kind of thing I’d normally choose to read — or not without a serious recommendation from a friend, for example. But it’s really, really good.</p>
<p>It’s a fictionalised autobiography, in that the protagonist goes through the same experience with contracting ME (<a href="http://www.meassociation.org.uk/">Myalgic Encephalopathy</a>) that Nasim herself did. And it’s set partly in Balloch, where we grew up.</p>
<p>Far more importantly, though, it’s a really good book. The characters are believable, especially the protagonist, Helen. That might be just as you&rsquo;d expect, as they&rsquo;re drawn from life; but I strongly suspect that it&rsquo;s no easier to write a convincing character based on a real person &ndash; even yourself &ndash; than to write one who is completely imaginary.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> We are drawn in to her inner life, her loves and her problems, and we are glad to be.</p>
<p>When she is laid low by the hateful condition, we feel her every twinge and ache. When she falls in love we fall right with her. And that&rsquo;s an important point: this isn&rsquo;t a misery memoir; it&rsquo;s by no means all about the illness, or even about Helen&rsquo;s responses to the illness. ME affects and influences everything in her life, but she still manages to <em>have</em> a life, and Nasim makes it an interesting one, one we&rsquo;re happy to share for a while.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time she manages to educate us about ME, through Helen&rsquo;s own learning about it. It is still a little-understood condition, with underfunded research and <a href="http://www.meassociation.org.uk/2014/04/me-association-oppose-nice-decision-not-to-review-their-guideline-on-mecfs-11-april-2014/">mistaken guidelines from NICE</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s a fine debut, and I look forward to reading more from Nasim.</p></body></html></p>

<p>Interesting to learn from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/16/true-confessions-adrian-mole-addict">this Guardian piece</a> that the first one was published at around the same time as The Smiths’ first gig. Adrian would probably have approved.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I always expect people to ask me about my use of the handle <code>devilgate</code>, but they almost never do. But an old friend did recently, and I wrote him the answer, and I think it belongs here.
<p>So sit back and relax, and I&rsquo;ll fill you in on the whole story.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re familiar with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)">origin story of the comics character Daredevil</a>, I assume? Well it&rsquo;s almost exactly like that, except with less radioactive material/eye interaction, blindness and skintight costumes. But with added rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll.</p>
<p>So, back around the time I was in primary 4 or 5 (age 9-10), <a href="http://www.suziquatro.com/">Suzi Quatro</a>, as I&rsquo;m sure you know, had a song called &lsquo;Devilgate Drive&rsquo; (or so I thought for decades; I was telling a colleague at work this story a few years back and we looked for it on Spotify, and couldn&rsquo;t find it; until we split it into two words: &lsquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvVr8oqkFqo&amp;feature=kp">Devil Gate Drive</a>'; somehow much less satisfying). I didn&rsquo;t actually know the song back then, but some of my classmates did, and started calling me &lsquo;Devilgate&rsquo;, precisely because I was decidedly non-devilish (or so I assume). I was seen as a bit of a goody-goody, because a) my Mum was a teacher, and b) I was a bit of a goody-goody.</p>
<p>As nicknames go, it was a lot better than it could have been. I remember once another kid asking me what it meant, and I said, &ldquo;Devilgate: the gate full of the devil.&rdquo; Which is kind of embarrassing, but considering how goody-goody I actually was (altar boy, and all that), it&rsquo;s surprising that I wasn&rsquo;t more bothered by the diabolical nature. Perhaps further evidence that all children are naturally without belief, until and unless they&rsquo;re indoctrinated into having some: I probably didn&rsquo;t really believe in the devil.</p>
<p>Anyway, spin forward a few years and I got online and was looking for a handle somewhere &ndash; <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> might have been where I first used it, and I was just trying to find out whether you can find the creation date of your <a href="http://slashdot.org/~Devilgate">Slashdot user ID</a>, but it seems you can&rsquo;t. I have a vague feeling, actually, that I used it somewhere else first, but I can&rsquo;t imagine where that might be.</p>
<p>Anyway, having established it, it became my go-to handle. Wherever there&rsquo;s a web service, if there&rsquo;s a devilgate (or Devilgate: I see that I capitalised it back in the Slashdot days), it&rsquo;ll almost certainly be me. Except for eBay, where I&rsquo;m devilgate_real, because some bampot had nicked my name by the time I got there.</p>
<p>And so when I finally got round to registering my own domain, it was obvious what I&rsquo;d choose.</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>The first three books of 2014 were:
</p><h3><cite>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</cite> by Neil Gaiman</h3>
<p>Gaiman&rsquo;s fantasy inspired by his own childhood experiences is fun. It is short, however, and strangely unmemorable after just a couple of months.</p>
<h3><cite>It</cite> by Stephen King</h3>
<p>I read some King when I was younger, but hadn&rsquo;t in several years apart from <cite>On Writing</cite>, until a couple of years ago when my beloved gave me <cite>11.22.63</cite>, his time-travel fantasy about going back to save JFK. I throughly enjoyed that, and was reminded that he had a vast back-catalogue that I could catch up on.</p>
<p>A significant portion of that catalogue is contained in the single volume of <cite>It</cite>. It is a monolith, a vast behemoth of a book, at around 1300 pages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, though, and I shouldn&rsquo;t fixate on its size. King uses the space to let his characters breathe and grow. They have the strange limitation as adults that they have almost totally forgotten their childhoods, as a direct result of their encounter with the titular creature. Though not, as you might suppose, because they were traumatised. Rather it seems to be a feature of interacting with the supernatural entity that haunts the town of Derry, Maine, in the primary guise of a scary clown, that, if you face it and live (few do) you forget the encounter.</p>
<p>I had met Derry before: in <cite>11.22.63</cite> the protagonist spends some time in this strange town, and the effect in the book was so jarring &ndash; it felt obvious that here was a place with a history &ndash; that I looked it up. Turns out he&rsquo;s used the fictional town as the setting for several stories (and presumably couldn&rsquo;t resist routing his time-traveller through it).</p>
<p>Anyway, getting back to the book at hand: I spent weeks embroiled in King&rsquo;s small-town America, its characters and its horrors. And I thoroughly enjoyed it, but am in no hurry to go back there soon.</p>
<h3><cite>Life After Life</cite> by Kate Atkinson</h3>
<p>Wow. Just wow. This is an awesome book. Atkinson manages to tell the same woman&rsquo;s life story again and again and keep it interesting and gripping every time (well, there&rsquo;s a slight <em>longueur</em> during a German period in one iteration, but the undercurrent of terror &ndash; she is living in the Führer&rsquo;s holiday home &ndash; keeps it from being a problem).</p>
<p>As you probably know, it&rsquo;s the tale of a woman who was born in 1910 and died &ndash; at various times, and in various ways. We are told the story of her life as she repeats it, again and again &ndash; or through multiple parallel timestreams. As the iterations go on, she starts to have some awareness of her past lives. She doesn&rsquo;t understand what they are at first, of course, especially as a child. At first she&rsquo;ll just have a sense of dread as she nears an event that killed her before. Later they are clearer memories of the future.</p>
<p>It is utterly fascinating and a joy. And not SF, though if I had read it soon enough I&rsquo;d have nominated it for the <a href="http://www.bsfa.co.uk/bsfa-awards/">BSFA Award</a>.</p>
<p>I read Kate Atkinson&rsquo;s first, <cite>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</cite>, years ago, and likened it to Iain Banks&rsquo;s <cite>The Crow Road</cite> (hard to to think of higher praise). I read one other, but wasn&rsquo;t so impressed, and rather lost track of her, apart from watching the TV adaptations of her detective stories. I think maybe I need to go back and catch up on her work.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Too many people died in 2013. So many, it seems, that when Philip Chevron of The Pogues died, I didn't get round to finishing my post. Here's what I wrote in October:
</p><blockquote>
  ... Except there ain't no fucking heaven, and too damn many people have left for it this year. I hate 2013.
<p>If there&rsquo;s one slightly positive thing about <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anne-margaret-daniel/philip-chevron-19572013_b_4065167.html">Philip Chevron dying two days ago</a> for me, it&rsquo;s that I was reminded that the box set <cite>Just Look Them Straight In The Eye And Say&hellip; <strong>Pogue Mahone!</strong></cite> exists; and also that it is now available in an inexpensive format for about £14. I ordered it on Tuesday night, and it arrived today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to it all afternoon. It&rsquo;s a combination of outtakes, demos, live tracks and radio sessions, and it&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>One thing that stands out at the moment, though, is that their music is steeped in the imagery of death. &ldquo;Some people left for heaven without warning&rdquo; is a line from “Sally Maclennane”, of course.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This is one of those unpublished posts <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/03/11/another-lost-month-and-unpublished-posts/">I told you about</a>. I don't know why it wasn't published (well, except that I hadn't written the last couple of sentences).
<p>A while back I heard the strangest ever request from a customer.</p>
<p>As you might know, I work for a software house.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> We write financial software for banks. As a thing to talk about it tends to be boring, but it can have interesting challenges.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of our product&rsquo;s problems, as a web-based app, is that it was written to specifically target the Internet Explorer browser.</p>
<p>I know that seems at best charmingly retro, and at worst appallingly non-standards-compliant, but there are a couple of good-ish reasons. Principally the fact that the original version of the web app was written by contractors who both only knew IE, and were told that our clients only cared about IE. The latter was probably true at the time, and as for the former, well: let&rsquo;s just say that sometimes people in companies make some stupid decisions, and leave it at that.</p>
<p>Inevitably, and especially as the browser landscape has matured and Apple and Google have come to rule the world, there have been calls to fix things. But there have always been higher-priorities. Getting new features done takes priority over making things work better, sadly.</p>
<p>One of these years we&rsquo;ll fix it &ndash; personally I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be as difficult as people always think (that fear is another reason why we have resisted doing it).</p>
<p>But what it would really take to force us to sort it out would be if a client demanded it.</p>
<p>If it were going to make or break a sale, we&rsquo;d be all hands on deck.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting that we got a query a while back wherein a client was concerned about the fact that the app doesn&rsquo;t work properly in Firefox. This was causing some of their users distress, as FF is their chosen browser. Was this it? Was this the opportunity, at last, driven by customer demand, to bring our app into the late twentieth century?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, the client had a better idea. They wanted us to to change our app such that it would detect that the user was running something other than IE&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; and prompt them to use IE instead.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>(We didn&rsquo;t agree to their request.)</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>OK, so not content with the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/01/31/missing-months/">last post</a> celebrating the fact that I missed a whole month, I then went on and missed February, too. These months just go by so fast.
<p>Anyway, a couple of things. I noticed that I have a few posts sitting in draft form but that are more-or-less complete, so you may shortly see some slightly-non-timely things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking I might have another go at blogging about the books I read. I appear not to have done that regularly since 2009 (these years go by so fast&hellip;) I might not give every book its own post, but put a few into a summary. As I&rsquo;ve only read three so far this year (one of them was Stephen King&rsquo;s 1300-page behemoth <cite>It</cite>, so I don&rsquo;t feel too bad about the count) I&rsquo;ll start with those.</p>
<p>This might just encourage me to post regularly, if not frequently.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here&rsquo;s a picture of Arthur&rsquo;s Seat to keep things visual.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I stayed with the Culture books, skipping over the non-Culture SF ones, <cite>Against a Dark Background</cite> and <cite>Feersum Endjinn</cite>. That brought me to <cite>Excession</cite>, in many ways Banksie’s Culture masterwork. Certainly it’s​ the first in which the ships take such central, starring roles, which makes it the defining one for me.</p>
<p>I remembered much more of this (I’ve definitely read it more than once before), but there were still bits that were only fuzzy at best. It is galaxy-spanning, “widescreen baroque” space opera at its best.</p>
<p>I hadn’t finished it by the time we went on holiday, so I had to take it with me with only a hundred or so pages to go. That was mildly annoying, but it didn’t take us over our weight limit.</p>
<p>The next Culture novel to be published is <cite>Inversions</cite>, but I didn’t quite feel like reading it, because I was keen to get to <cite>Look to Windward</cite>. I feel as if I’ve been wanting to reread that almost since I first read it. So I took it with me, and with only a brief interruption to finish <cite>The Magus</cite> in the appropriate country, as <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2013/09/21/the-summer-of-rereading-1-the-magus-by-john-fowles/">I’ve already discussed</a>, I stormed into it.</p>
<p>And, err, it was a bit disappointing, actually.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing about not remembering books though: I remembered almost nothing about this. I <em>thought</em> I remembered it, but really I only had the setup (the business of waiting for the light from the stars destroyed in the Culture-Idiran War to arrive) and one brief scene near the end. This had the great positive that it was almost like reading a new Culture novel.</p>
<p>The trouble with it is that the plot is quite thin, and mostly happening off stage. And a lot of the events that happen in between​ are only really there to show off some of the fantasicness of living on a Culture orbital. In a sense it tries to do exactly what Banksie himself said you can’t really do, which is to set a story in a utopia. This is why the Culture novels general focus on someone working for Special Circumstances or at least Contact; they happen at the edges of the utopia, or just outside its fringes, where things are a lot more dangerous.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing threat to at least one of the main characters, but it doesn’t really engage us all that much. We don’t, perhaps, care all that much about what happens to them.</p>
<p>That said, there are still some great moments. But I wonder whether my expectations, set by my memory of really enjoying it, were too high. It’s often best to approach artistic works with lowered expectations.</p>

			 <html><body><p>After Iain Banks died I decided it was long past time for a big reread of all his books. Most of the older ones were in the attic, though, so it was a while before I got started.
<p>The books in the attic aren&rsquo;t terribly well ordered, since they&rsquo;re just in boxes, and have been moved in and out of them over the years. Also it&rsquo;s very dusty up there. Not that that affects the order or accessibility of the books; I just say it to try to evoke some sympathy. Poor, poor, pitiful me, sneezing in old clothes while looking through lots and lots of lovely books.</p>
<p>I digress. Sometimes I think its what I do best, actually. One of the non-Banksie things I found was the box containing my copies of <cite><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Marvel</span>Miracleman</cite>, which I hadn&rsquo;t read for a long, long while. To my shock, an issue was missing. Luckily it was an early one (4, I think), and I also found my <cite>Warrior</cite>s, where it was originally published, so I had all the material. I still prefer it in black &amp; white with the bigger pages, incidentally.</p>
<p>On a theme that will become common, I was surprised at how much I didn&rsquo;t remember. The whole &ldquo;Olympus&rdquo; thing, for example. I thought that was just a passing page or two at the end, but it&rsquo;s actually woven through the second half of the work. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t remember much after the part that was in <cite>Warrior</cite> apart from Johnny Bates&rsquo;s carnage in London.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s still pretty good, but not as good as I remembered. It doesn&rsquo;t hold up the way <cite>Watchmen</cite> still does, in my opinion. Also Thatcher appears in it briefly, which is just weird.</p>
<p>To return to my digression, I found various things in the attic that I haven&rsquo;t read in a long time, so there will doubtless be more rereading ahead. Which is kind of a shame, because as always there are so many new (and old but unread) books to read.</p>
<p>But back to Banksie. I thought of just starting at the beginning and working through them all in order of publication. But I found I didn&rsquo;t really feel like reading <cite>The Wasp Factory</cite> at the time, while I did feel like reading some of the SF. So I started with the Culture novels. I thoroughly enjoyed all that I&rsquo;ve got through so far, and had the mostly-pleasant (but slightly worrying) sense of not being totally familiar with them.</p>
<p><strong><cite>Consider Phlebas</cite><cite></cite></strong>: I still find it striking that here in the first Culture novel, if you don&rsquo;t have any prompting about the Culture, it&rsquo;s not <em>totally</em> obvious that they&rsquo;re the good guys. Horza is so well-written, so sympathetic as a viewpoint character, that it&rsquo;s hard not to support his anti-Culture beliefs. That those beliefs are not really examined (in the time period of the novel, at least) is probably a realistic picture of how most of us go through most of our lives.</p>
<p><strong><cite>The Player of Games</cite></strong>: I had remembered this as one I hadn&rsquo;t liked so much, with its gloomy, spoiled protagonist. Gurgeh is both of those things, but he is also manipulated quite thoroughly by Special Circumstances<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and in the end his life is improved because of it. Which wasn&rsquo;t their intention (probably); or not their main one, at least. But it does tell us that no matter how good your life is in the Culture, it can still get better. Damn.</p>
<p><strong><cite>Use of Weapons</cite></strong>: There&rsquo;s a game you can play when you&rsquo;re reading most Culture novels: it is, &ldquo;What Are Special Circumstances Trying to Achieve This Time?&rdquo; This is the book with the largest number of distinct chances to play, as we work backwards through Zakalwe&rsquo;s timeline. A series of grim fragments of conflicts on different worlds, with Zakalwe always there as some kind of general or military advisor. We see him at the end of his engagement each time, and usually at the end of his tether if not the end of a rope.</p>
<p>And the forward-running chapters also have an unresolved special circumstance. But we don&rsquo;t really care about it, or any of the others. We care about Zakalwe. And about Sma, and the wonderfully-named drone, Skaffen-Amtiskaw; but mainly about Zakalwe. Which is impressive work by Banksie, considering.</p>
<p>But more later.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>A summer of rereading, that's what this one has been for me. Let me tell you about it.
<p><strong>Note: contains spoilers</strong></p>
<p>Early on &ndash; maybe it was still spring &ndash; when we booked our holiday to Greece, I decided it was time to reread <cite>The Magus</cite>.  I read it something like thirty years ago, when I was at university. I remember enjoying it, but being annoyed by the ending.</p>
<p>So I was expecting that annoyance to still be there. On occasions between then and this rereading, I have looked at the last couple of pages. I did so again before starting it this time; it was no clearer for doing so. Fowles himself recognised problems with the ending. In his foreword to the revised edition, he acknowledges that the novel has flaws, not least that it is a novel of adolescence, both his and that of his protagonist. (I found Nicholas to be annoyingly adolescent and spoilt, especially at the start, on this reading.) He goes on to say:</p>
</p><blockquote>
  The other change is in the ending. Though its general intent has never seemed to me as obscure as some readers have evidently found it -- perhaps because they have not given due weight to the two lines from the <cite>Pervigilium Veneris</cite> that close the book -- I accept that I might have declared a preferred aftermath less ambiguously… and have now done so.
</blockquote>
<p>(Ellipsis the author&rsquo;s, incidentally.) The thing is, he hasn&rsquo;t done so. Not really. Not if you want to know whether or not Nicholas and Alison get back together, which seems to have been what his correspondents regarding the original edition were concerned about.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what bothered me, either then or now. I don&rsquo;t mind an ambiguous ending. And I actually kind of like the way you can think of it as a freeze-frame, like the ending of a film (<cite>Bonnie and Clyde</cite> ends like that, if I remember correctly &ndash; though in a more dramatic event).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>No, what annoys me is that we never really learn what Conchis and the others were up to. They called their project &ldquo;The Godgame&rdquo; (it was also Fowles&rsquo;s proposed title for the novel at one point); but what was the point of it? What were they trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Ultimately I suppose that can be answered in part by Fowles&rsquo;s argument regarding people asking about the &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of the novel:</p>
<blockquote>
  If <cite>The Magus</cite> has any "real significance", it is no more than that of the Rorschach Test in psychology. Its meaning is whatever reaction it provokes in the reader[.]
</blockquote>
<p>So the Godgame&rsquo;s meaning or purpose may be simply the reaction it provokes in Nicholas; but that still leaves us wondering, as I said above, why did Conchis do it? Was it just the whim of a rich man? He did it because he could? And yet mere whim feels weak alongside all the discussion of freedom and what it means.</p>
<p>In the end the mild sense of frustration remains, because we never find that out.</p>
<p>Back when I first read it, there was no immediately obvious way to find discussions of it. No doubt there were some in academic journals and theses, but finding those would have been difficult. Now, of course, such discussions are easy to find. And the most interesting one I found recently was by Jo Walton on Tor.com: <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2009/11/twists-of-the-godgame-john-fowless-lemgthe-maguslemg">Twists of the Godgame: John Fowles&rsquo;s <cite>The Magus</cite></a>. As Walton says, the ending &ldquo;twists at just the wrong moment and sends it away from metaphysics into triviality and romance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She goes on to compare it to Ted Chiang’s “The Story of Your Life”, which I haven&rsquo;t read. But the argument that &ldquo;Fowles doesn’t know what he’s doing, that the underlying reality that is never explained doesn’t make sense&rdquo; rings true for me. And so when she says that &ldquo;what Chiang’s &lsquo;The Story of Your Life&rsquo; does is what Fowles may have wanted to do&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m inclined to suspect that she&rsquo;ll be proved right when I come to read the Chiang.</p>
<p>I still loved the book, though: you can enjoy the journey even if you&rsquo;re not entirely happy with the destination. Walton&rsquo;s conclusion gives a hilarious suggestion for how it could have been improved, though:</p>
<blockquote>
  It’s beautifully written. The characters are so real I’d recognise them if I saw them at the bus-stop. And there’s nothing wrong with it that couldn’t be fixed by having them go off in an alien space ship at the end.
</blockquote>
<p>Now that would have been an ending.</body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>On Wednesday I went to <a href="http://www.brunel.ac.uk/arts/english/news-and-events/news/ne_312482">The State of the Culture</a>, a symposium on Iain M Banks's "Culture" novels, at Brunel University. <a href="http://ttdlabyrinth.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/the-state-of-the-culture/">Paul Kincaid's writeup</a> suggests that his experience was very similar to mine. Including the journey. I thought it was a long hike from Hackney, but he came all the way from Folkestone. And I managed to find the main reception, where they gave me a map showing the way to the Antonin Artaud building. I was later than Paul, though.
<p>I was surprised that it was so sparsely attended. There were only about thirty people there, including all the ones who were presenting papers. Given Banksie&rsquo;s popularity, I thought it would be packed. A few years back when he was guest at the <a href="http://bsfa.co.uk/">BSFA</a>&rsquo;s monthly London meeting, they had to have it in a lecture hall at Imperial College, instead of the usual room over or under a pub.  I suppose that either the academic nature of it put people off, or just that it wasn&rsquo;t very well publicised. Shame, really.</p>
<p>My assessment of the event generally is much the same as Paul&rsquo;s so you can just read his comments.  But of the papers that were presented, the one that I was most disappointed by was the one that I would probably have found most interesting, if I had been able to hear it. Martyn Colebrook&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Playing Games with Gods: <cite>The Player of Games</cite>&rdquo;, which compared the Banks work with John Fowles&rsquo;s <cite>The Magus</cite>. By coincidence I&rsquo;ve read both of those in the last couple of months (and more on them later), so it would have been interesting to hear what Dr Colebrook had to say.  But unfortunately he was just speaking too quietly for the human ear, which is what I&rsquo;m equipped with (I was at the back of the room, having arrived late).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sought his paper online, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be around yet.  Maybe sometime.</p>
<p>The most used word of the day, apart from &ldquo;Culture&rdquo;, was &ldquo;transgressive&rdquo;. Indeed, the same Dr Colebrook has edited a collection of essays called <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Transgressive-Iain-Banks-Borders-ebook/dp/B00DWJCS4W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379113088&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=transgressive+iain+banks">The Transgressive Iain Banks</a></cite>.</p></body></html></p>

From <a href="http://m.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/jun/10/iain-banks-ken-macleod-science-fiction">Ken McLeod's reminder in <cite>The Guardian</cite></a> that he was an SF writer first and foremost, through <a href="http://andrewcferguson.com/2013/06/16/so-long-iain/">personal tributes</a> by <a href="http://www.list.co.uk/article/51809-iain-banks-obituary/">some of my friends</a> to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/jun/15/iain-banks-the-final-interview">Stuart Kelly's "final interview"</a> in <cite>The Guardian</cite> (and not forgetting <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b02xf70k/Iain_Banks_Raw_Spirit/">Kirsty Wark's "final interview"</a>, which should be around on iPlayer for a while).
<p>Now it&rsquo;s my turn.  I didn&rsquo;t know him personally at all, despite having friends who did.  Of course I would echo all the comments to the effect that he was a friendly and entertaining speaker, having seen him at several conventions and readings.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the books, man, the books.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not totally sure when I first heard of <cite>The Wasp Factory</cite>, but I&rsquo;d be willing to bet it was from my friend <a href="http://www.andrewjwilsonpublishingservices.co.uk/">Andrew</a>.  I think I remember him mentioning it, but maybe I had heard of it already.  Either way, sometime around 86 or 87, I&rsquo;d say, I started reading his books.  I know that the first three at least were already out (and in paperback).  Maybe <cite>Consider Phlebas</cite>, too. And I loved them, especially <cite>The Bridge</cite> and <cite>Espedair Street</cite>.  It was clear &ndash; even before he started publishing explicit science fiction with the added initial &ndash; that he was one of us.  <cite>The Bridge</cite>&rsquo;s fantasy sequences, and those of <cite>Walking on Glass</cite>, can be read as the products of damaged minds; but they&rsquo;re better if you read them as at being about what&rsquo;s really happening to their protagonists.</p>
<p>The first three SF novels are fine and dandy, but it wasn&rsquo;t them that really changed me.  Changed me, that is, into a buyer of hardback books &ndash; and an on-release buyer of Banksie.  But it was at a science-fiction convention that it happened.  And all it took was a friend&rsquo;s recommendation, and a single line.</p>
<p>It must have been 1992, so the convention would have been Illumination, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastercon">Eastercon</a> in Blackpool.  Though it could have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novacon">Novacon</a> that year.  Either way, I had seen the new one by Banksie in the book room, but decided to wait for the paperback, as was my wont in those days.  Hardbacks seemed incredibly expensive, at maybe fifteen or sixteen pounds.</p>
<p>Luckily I prevaricated to my friend <a href="http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~steve/">Steve</a>.  He said, &ldquo;You should buy it, Martin.&rdquo;  I resisted still.  He said, &ldquo;Just read the first line and you&rsquo;ll buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did. It was, &ldquo;It was the day my grandmother exploded.&rdquo;  I bought <cite>The Crow Road</cite> instantly, and have bought every subsequent Banksie in hardback on release.  Except for <cite>Raw Spirit</cite>, which came out just before Christmas (and surprised me by appearing in WH Smith&rsquo;s when I hadn&rsquo;t even heard it existed).  I didn&rsquo;t buy it right away, but received it a few days later as a perfectly-targeted Secret Santa present from a work colleague.</p>
<p>So I just want to thank those friends, and thank Iain&rsquo;s memory for a great, great body of work.  I can&rsquo;t express how sad I am that we won&rsquo;t hear from him again.</p>
<p>Oh, and calling him &ldquo;Banksie&rdquo;?  That has always been the way in the SF community, and he used it himself.  Always with the &ldquo;ie&rdquo;; that guy with &ldquo;y&rdquo; ending is just some blow-in.  I&rsquo;m sure it comes from having been &ldquo;Banks, I&rdquo; at school; just as Daniel Weir of <cite>Espedair Street</cite> got his nickname &ldquo;Weird&rdquo; from being &ldquo;Weir, D&rdquo;.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>With <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite> fever in full swing (to mix a metaphor), I've been thinking about the book a lot today. I tweeted yesterday that I had never really got what all the fuss was about.
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Want to see the _Great Gatsby_ movie, yet despite re-reading the book last summer, I fail to see what people think is so good about it. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23fb">#fb</a>— Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/336140686527168514">May 19, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I find it hard to explain what I find problematic about it. I wouldn't say it's <em>bad</em>, just that it's not as good as nearly everyone says it is. I see it as largely being about rich people having parties, and a couple of tragic deaths. And while I don't think that you have to like -- or even identify with -- all the characters for fiction to work, in this case none of them has any redeeming feature, as far as I can tell.
<p>There&rsquo;s a recent <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/03/what-makes-great-gatsby">article in the Guardian by Sarah Churchwell</a> about how wonderful it all is. It&rsquo;s a well-written piece, but I find it just as hard to get to grips with, to understand the point of, as the novel itself.</p>
<p>So I did a search for &ldquo;Gatsby overrated&rdquo;, and found <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2013/05/schulz-on-the-great-gatsby.html">this piece by Kathryn Schulz</a> which absolutely nails it.</p>
<p>One point she makes perhaps helps to explain why I find the characters so objectionable:</p>
</p><blockquote>
  Like many American moralists, Fitzgerald was more offended by pleasure than by vice, and he had a tendency to confound them. In The Great Gatsby, polo and golf are more morally suspect than murder.
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
  On the page, Fitzgerald’s moralizing instinct comes off as cold; the chill that settles around The Great Gatsby is an absence of empathy.
</blockquote>
<p>My favourite part is her parenthetical assertion that:</p>
<blockquote>
  In a literary hostage exchange, I would trade a thousand Fitzgeralds for one Edward St. Aubyn, 10,000 for an Austen or Dickens.
</blockquote>
<p>Though I had to look up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_St_Aubyn">Edward St. Aubyn</a>.</p>
<p>But her main argument concerns the shallowness of the characterisations, the emphasis on symbolism over emotion:</p>
<blockquote>
  Of the great, redemptive romance on which the entire story is supposed to turn, he admitted, “I gave no account (and had no feeling about or knowledge of) the emotional relations between Gatsby and Daisy.”
<p>What was Fitzgerald doing instead of figuring out such things about his characters? Precision-engineering his plot, chiefly, and putting in overtime at the symbol factory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, though, as I think on it some more, the problem with it all (and in contradiction to the last quote above) is the thinness of the plot. The prose is famously poetic in places, and that&rsquo;s fine; but the real weakness is that there&rsquo;s almost no story there.</p>
<p>And that famous last line<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>?  Poetic though it is, when you parse it, it means absolutely nothing at all.</body></html></p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>&ldquo;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past&rdquo;, as I&rsquo;m sure you know.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <html><body><p>Spotify has always behaved weirdly regarding how you queue tracks up.  Today I think I realised why.

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking like a programmer, I admit: queues are first-in-first-out; but more importantly, like an ordinary person: you join a queue at the end, not just behind the person at the front.</p>
<p><a href="http://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-Ideas/Queues-It-s-about-time-this-was-sorted-out/idc-p/285846#M19726">See this discussion on their suggestions board</a> which explains the weirdness, and is where (as I was adding a comment) I suddenly understood their thinking.  Also <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/cue">definition 2 of &ldquo;cue&rdquo;</a> is the appropriate one.</p>
<p><strong>Edited:</strong> Queues are of course <em>first</em>-in-first-out, not last-in-first-out, as I wrote. That would be a <em>stack</em>, in programming terms.  Whoops!</p></body></html></p>

<p>Here’s one that I made using the title of a story of mine.  It remains unpublished so far, but it was the short story that was the seed for the [novel I finished in November](http://devilgate.org/blog/2012/12/02/november-spawned-some-words-but-not-that-many/).</p>

			 <html><body><p>We had a wee day trip to Cambridge yesterday (Monday). Lovely city. I took some photographs.  They're so small and unlinked because, I think, I'm experimenting with a plugin for Lightroom that uploads them directly to the blog.  But I have a few wrinkles to iron out, I think.  There are bigger versions of them [at my Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/devilgate/), if you're interested.
<p>First, some punters punting on the Cam:</p>

<img alt="" src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wpid1652-Loch-Lomond-Jetty-2.jpg" width="200" height="300">
<p>Then the famous King&rsquo;s College Chapel.  More of a cathedral, really:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wpid1654-Loch-Lomond-Jetty-3.jpg" width="300" height="200">
<p>This wee guy looks decidedly unhappy:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wpid1656-Loch-Lomond-Jetty-4.jpg" width="300" height="200">
<p>There&rsquo;s a pair of war memorials in a side chapel.  A famous name at position 2 of the WWI one:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wpid1658-Loch-Lomond-Jetty-5.jpg" width="300" height="200">
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of stained glass, of course, but in another side chapel we see this interesting creature:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wpid1660-Loch-Lomond-Jetty-6.jpg" width="300" height="200">
<p>Then on to Trinity College Chapel, where Isaac Newton stands in marble:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wpid1664-Loch-Lomond-Jetty-8.jpg" width="300" height="200">
<p>Here&rsquo;s a closeup of Newton.  I can&rsquo;t work out what he&rsquo;s holding:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wpid1666-Loch-Lomond-Jetty-9.jpg" width="200" height="300">
<p>And above him there&rsquo;s this rather attractive chandelier and dramatic ceiling:</p>

			 <html><body><p>I never really got Instagram.  I mean, I got the app, I signed up, and I posted a few photos.  But I never totally got what it was for.  I mean, social photos?  OK, I followed a few people I knew on Twitter, but it never really amounted to much.  And you couldn't even see your pictures on the web at first.  The filters were interesting, but only up to a point, and <a href="http://www.myglasseye.net/news/2011/09/instagram-2-0-review-insta-grumble/">they got worse</a>.
<p>But somehow I could never totally see the point.  Flickr I understood: it&rsquo;s a site to store your photos.  If you don&rsquo;t have, or don&rsquo;t want the bother of managing, your own web space, you can put your pictures there and show them to other people.  And it&rsquo;s got the social thing going on, too, with the ability to follow people and all that.  It feels a bit bolted on, but it does no harm.  And when I discover a site like <a href="http://500px.com">500px</a>, as I did a few weeks ago, well, that&rsquo;s obvious: a place to store your pictures and to find other people&rsquo;s.  Not for nothing is their tag line, &ldquo;The best photos on the web&rdquo; (or it was: today it says, &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s best photo sharing&rdquo;, which is similar, but different).  I just wish they&rsquo;d learn how to keep me signed in.</p>
<p>But Instagram didn&rsquo;t really grab me.  And today they nearly ejected me.</p>
<p>Oddly for a net-based thing, I heard about <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/38143346554/privacy-and-terms-of-service-changes-on-instagram">the new terms of service</a> on the radio.  The story was that the terms were going to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/dec/18/facebook-instagram-sell-uploaded-photos">allow them to sell their users' pictures for advertising</a>, without paying, asking, or even telling the users.</p>
<p>I tweeted:</p>
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Did I just hear on the radio that Instagram is committing suicide?— Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/281093504560660480" data-datetime="2012-12-18T17:48:08+00:00">December 18, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>It turns out to be not <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/18/instagram-suicide-note_n_2323100.html">as bad as we thought</a>, at least according to <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/38252135408/thank-you-and-were-listening">this post from Instagram</a>.  Though I only found that because I clicked the "I'd like to delete my account" link.  On the confirmation page there was a link to that post.  It turns out there's an Instagram blog, and both the terms of service change and this update were posted there.  But who knew about that?
<p>So for now I haven&rsquo;t deleted my account, and we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>I found out about the change from the radio, and the correction by requesting a deletion; my inbox remains unsullied.  How about a wee email, Instagram?  You&rsquo;ve got my address.</p>
<p><strong>Edited to add:</strong> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/18/3780158/instagrams-new-terms-of-service-what-they-really-mean">According to this post</a>, the new terms are actually better than the old ones.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I'm not very good at this <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/en/about">NaNoWriMo</a> thing, it turns out (again).  This year I declared myself a <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/en/forums/nano-rebels/threads/60762">NaNo Rebel</a> (basically anyone who aims to write 50,000 words, but not of a brand-new novel).  I had originally hoped to finish my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2010/11/30/nono/">previous novel</a> before November started, and leave November clear for taking a big run at the new one, the idea for which <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/statuses/182916113741520896">came knocking</a> when I was about three-quarters of the way through the then-current one.  But as it turned out I didn't manage to finish it until <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/265818475761659904">a few days into November</a>.  So I decided just to count the words of original fiction I wrote in November.
<p>Which proved to be just as well, because after just a couple of days on the new novel, I was cycling home from work one day when a short story deposited itself in my head, unbidden, but complete.  I took a few days off from the novel to work on that, thus further ensuring my rebellious state.</p>
<p>As an experiment for my own interest, I also tried to keep a note of how many words I wrote for other things, both at home and at work; just to get an idea of how many words I write normally.  I kept that all in a Google Docs spreadsheet, so I could get to it wherever I was.  I&rsquo;m sure I wasn&rsquo;t complete in recording everything, though.</p>
<p>In the end I wrote 16,600 words of fiction;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> so comparable with <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/12/02/the-words-that-maketh-novels/">last year</a>.  And oh, dear: reading over those old posts to get links makes me realise that this is the <em>third</em> NaNo during which I&rsquo;ve been working on <cite>Accidental Upgrade</cite>.</p>
<p>But having said that, the thing that I&rsquo;m underplaying in all this is that: <strong>I. Finished.  My. Novel.</strong>  89,000 words of first draft, done and… well, left quite dusty, truth be told.</p>
<p>And a new short story drafted, and another novel reasonably well under way.  I&rsquo;m feeling quite positive about it all.</p></body></html></p>

Because dialogue is about moving information around and expressing character.  What you know about them affects the way they talk.  Take a book you like — or, hell, even one you don’t — and select a passage of dialogue, and see what you can learn about those characters from the way they speak.

			 <p>I finally have a dSLR.  No longer do I have to hold my camera up in front of me in that quite silly-looking way; once again I can look through a viewfinder.  Hurrah!</p>
<p>I say “once again” because I used to have — well, still do have, but almost never use — a film SLR, namely an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_OM-1">Olympus OM-1</a>.</p>
<p>With the new one I’ve gone over to Canon, though.  It’s an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_600D">EOS 600D</a>; which rather oddly is known in America as the Rebel T3i and in Japan as the Kiss X5</p>
<p>Here’s a picture of Clapton Pond to show you what it can do.  Click through for a better view on Flickr.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devilgate/8024623295/in/photostream/lightbox/" title="Fountain by devilgate, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8038/8024623295_af03ba816e.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Fountain"></a></p>
<p>I bought it online for full £200 less than I’d&rsquo;ve had to pay at <a href="http://www.jessops.com">Jessops</a>; and by going to a site called <a href="http://www.digitalrev.com/">DigitalRev</a> I saved about £100 over Amazon’s prices.  DigitalRev’s service was incredibly good: my camera arrived in London from Hong Kong in two days.  It took a few more days for DHL to get it to me, but that’s not DigitalRev’s fault.  Really astonishingly fast service, and for the cheapest price I could find anywhere.</p>
<p>The only slightly annoying thing is that I clicked a link in their email asking for comments (essentially to say the above); it took me to a site called <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com/">Reseller Ratings</a>, where I filled in a few boxes, and then hit “Submit”… whereupon it wanted me to create a profile before I could submit the review.  And I just couldn’t face it.  I’ll almost certainly never go to that site again, so even though it’s only a name and email (and password) I just thought, “No.  I’d rather put a good review up on my own site.”</p>
<p>So think on that, people running review sites.</p>

			 <html><body><p>So, it's all finally over, and we go back to normal.  Or perhaps not.  The slogan of London 2012 was "Inspire a Generation", and I think that has happened.
<p>But the question is, what generation?</p>
<p>The tacit assumption was always that the slogan applied to the <em>next</em> generation: to teenagers and younger kids.  Get them up off their arses, it implied, and away from their consoles, and down to their local sports hall, playing field, or pool.</p>
<p>Whether and to what extent that has worked will take a long time to see.  But there&rsquo;s another generation that is already visibly inspired, to my admittedly limited view.</p>
<p>Mine.</p>
<p>Where by &ldquo;mine&rdquo; I sort of mean &ldquo;everyone who&rsquo;s not still a child.&rdquo;  Because what I&rsquo;m seeing as I cycle to and from work these days is that the streets are <em>packed</em> with cyclists.  And people out running, too; there are definitely more than usual.  But it&rsquo;s us London cyclists who are really showing up.</p>
<p>I personally have taken public transport to work only once since before the Olympics started,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and I&rsquo;ve been pushing myself to get that bit faster on my bike rides.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of it as something like, &ldquo;Hoy!  It&rsquo;s the Pendleton-Trott-Kenny-Wiggins effect.&rdquo;  But that&rsquo;s a bit unwieldy, and misses some names out.</p>
<p>It is clear to me, though, that the &ldquo;generation&rdquo; that is in their twenties, thirties and yes, forties &ndash; and probably older &ndash; are out there in bigger numbers than ever before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see how it holds up as autumn and winter come in, of course.  But vastly increased cycling in London?  That would really be a worthwhile legacy.</p>

			 <html><body><h2>Initial scepticism</h2>
<p>Back in 2004, 2005 or so, when London was bidding to host the Olympics, I was against it.  My concerns were the cost, the crowding, and the general disruption of it all.  I was, I admit, cynical.  I recall being annoyed by the fact that the people running the bid published a number to which you could text &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, to say you supported the bid; but there was no option to text &ldquo;no&rdquo; to say you opposed it.</p>
<p><a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2005/07/06/2012/">Looking back to what I wrote at the time</a>, I see that my biggest concern was the effect on the Lower Lee Valley.  It turned out that the removal of wilderness didn&rsquo;t stretch as far as my fears suggested; and of course much of the land that has been used was polluted, abandoned, brownfield industrial sites.  Bob Stanley of St Etienne (the band) has an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/24/olympics-changed-lower-lea-valley?mobile-redirect=false">interesting piece in <cite>The Guardian</cite></a> about that.</p>
<h2>Coming round</h2>
<p>But then London won the bid, and I though, &ldquo;OK, fine, it&rsquo;ll be interesting at least.&rdquo;  I had enjoyed watching the previous ones, and there was the regeneration for East London that looked promising.  And the fact that it would just be down the road for me added to the interest.  After all, that would make it easier to get tickets, right?  Obviously there would specific tickets made available to to locals.</p>
<p>Hindsight even makes me wonder whether the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2005/07/07/today/">events of the very next day</a> didn&rsquo;t make me more supportive: blitz spirit, don&rsquo;t let the bastards grind you down, &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power">soft power</a>&rdquo;, and all that.</p>
<h2>The intervening years</h2>
<h3>Worries</h3>
<p>In the years since then I&rsquo;ve gone through various thoughts about the whole thing.  Obviously there were the concerns about how long we would be paying for it all.  And more recently there were the worries about the security preparations and the expected madness of the precautions.  Of course more recently we&rsquo;ve had the G4S fiasco, and the drafting in of extra soldiers.</p>
<p>More bizarrely we&rsquo;ve seen the growth of the Olympic &ldquo;brand police&rdquo;, the forbidding of certain words and combinations of words (including, ridiculously, things like &ldquo;summer&rdquo;, &ldquo;bronze&rdquo;, and &ldquo;2012&rdquo;).</p>
<h3>Cycle-friendly or not?</h3>
<p>But closer to home one of the things that has annoyed me is the way they&rsquo;ve treated our towpath.</p>
<p>The main stadium sits between two branches of the River Lee (or Lea): the river itself, and the Lee Navigation or Cut, which is essentially a canal constructed as a tributary<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of the main river.  The towpath of the Navigation is a popular cycling and walking route for us local types.  As we watched the construction site form and the massive buildings grow (and in my case <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2012/01/30/your-friendly-olympic-park/">moaned about the ugly fencing round it</a>), we were able to keep a close eye on it all by going along the towpath.  And indeed, a minor, but pleasing, instance of regeneration has been the resurfacing of the towpath, making it much more pleasant to cycle on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Above all, it seemed obvious that we would use the towpath to actually get to the Olympic Park.  How else?</p>
<p>Until a few months ago when it became clear that the towpath was going to be closed for the duration of the games.  The reason given &ndash; of course &ndash; was &ldquo;security&rdquo;.  But what exactly is the security risk of providing  access via the towpath?</p>
<p>In all honesty, I had my doubts about its use during the games; but I wasn&rsquo;t concerned about terrorism.  Rather I feared for people&rsquo;s safety.  It&rsquo;s a towpath, after all: relatively narrow, unfenced, and unlit.  And, critically, next to a polluted canal.  If thousands &ndash; or even only hundreds &ndash; of people were trying to leave the park that way all at once &ndash; after the opening ceremony, say &ndash; then I could see that it would be problematic.</p>
<p>So I begin to wonder whether the &ldquo;security&rdquo; excuse was brought out to hide the more mundane, but always-criticised-by-the-tabloids truth: health and safety.</p>
<p>Then we heard that bikes would be among the banned items in the park; but also that there would be cycle parking: it <em>sounded</em> like mixed messages, but we would have to wait and see.</p>
<h3>Those pesky tickets and the getting thereof</h3>
<p>Ah, the joys of Olympic ticketing.  Even as I write, on the third full day of the Games, they don&rsquo;t seem to have really sorted it all out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a massively complex task, to allocate and sell tickets for hundreds of events over dozens of venues, all taking place in such a concentrated time period.  But it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;ve never done it before; it&rsquo;s not even like they haven&rsquo;t done it in the Internet Age.  It should largely be a solved problem, it seems to me.</p>
<p>We had decided to treat the Olympics as our family holiday: we would take a couple of weeks off, buy a load of tickets, and that would be our main summer break.  After all, it would be just down the road, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, etc.  So we signed up for the ballot, spent time listing events we might like to see, and so on.  When the time came we hit the website and listed a summer holiday&rsquo;s worth of tickets (hampered slightly by me having a MasterCard, which of course is the black sheep of Olympic ticket-buying).</p>
<p>In the end my beloved was allocated tickets to three events, and I got none (had they detected that invalid-card possession?)</p>
<p>However, that was just the initial ballot; and because I had been unsuccessful there, I was entitled to try to buy tickets in the conventional way in the second round.</p>
<p>On the day I woke up early and grabbed my laptop.  The site, inevitably, crumpled.  I went back to sleep for a bit.  Tried again later.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall how long it took, but in the end I managed to get a further three events.</p>
<p>And that was that.  Remember when I said up there, &ldquo;it would just be down the road … that would make it easier to get tickets&rdquo;?  Yeah.  Somehow that didn&rsquo;t happen.  The Olympics is clearly not meant for the people who live near it.  Or not particularly.  I&rsquo;m not suggesting it should be <em>only</em> for locals; but how hard would it have been to allocate a percentage of tickets to residents of host boroughs &ndash; or the whole of London &ndash; in a first pass?  If they didn&rsquo;t get bought they would be offered on, of course.  The answer is &ldquo;not very&rdquo;; the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2012/06/28/weekend-warblers/">Hackney Weekend</a> festival did exactly that, after all.  Glastonbury gives free tickets to residents of the nearby village, I seem to recall.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s where we are.  We later added a Paralympic athletics day, which will finally get us into the main stadium; and a set of Olympic Park passes, so we can go and have a wander round and soak up the atmosphere on Wednesday.  But as I write there are still tickets available, even for swimming, even for the main stadium.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re made of money, at least.  Hell, you can still go to the closing ceremony if you&rsquo;ve got £995 or £1500 to spare.</p>
<h2>But still…</h2>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t mean to turn all negative.  I&rsquo;m actually really excited about it all, and thoroughly enjoying everything I&rsquo;ve seen on telly; especially, of course, Danny Boyle&rsquo;s masterpiece of an opening ceremony.  Much has been said about that elsewhere, so I won&rsquo;t say a lot.  Just that it was far better, and a far truer representation of Britain than we could have imagined, or even hoped for.  Part of the fun was following along on Twitter, of course (when it wasn&rsquo;t too distracting to do so).  And my favourite comment of all was one that <a href="https://twitter.com/MitchBenn">Mitch Benn</a> retweeted from <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSimonEvans">Simon Evans</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  It's not that I'm proud to be British. It's that I'm grateful.
</blockquote>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been enjoying seeing the first few days worth of events on telly.  Some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tennis is just like Wimbledon, except with colour, and Omega timing instead of IBM.  And "London 2012" logos, of course.</li>
<li>I normally go from one Wimbledon to the next without watching any sport; now, suddenly, I'm almost fanatical about everything (except boxing and anything with horses; and archery is much more boring than you might expect).</li>
<li>Seeing those cyclists in the road races made me want to get on my bike; not for those kind of distances, though.</li>
<li>Similarly, badminton &amp; table tennis; maybe there will be a knock-on effect on people doing sport after all.</li>
</ul>
<p>I should write about legacy (and sustainability<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>), but I&rsquo;ve gone on long enough, and anyway, it&rsquo;s another whole discussion.  But I cycled down that way on Saturday; along the part of the towpath that&rsquo;s still open, across Hackney Marshes (by a new, temporary path) and to the bridge across the river where there is access via Eton Manor Gate.  There is a vast cycle park there, and from the gate it&rsquo;s only supposed to be a few minutes walk to, for example, the Basketball Arena.  So it&rsquo;s all good.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>We visit the park on Wednesday, and start seeing actual events from Friday.  I may report back.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></body></html></p>

<p>The most chilling thing about this is not so much banning the broadcast; there could conceivably be a legitimate reason for that, though it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a good one.  Rather it is this:</p>

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2012/07/02/tip-using-pandoc-to-create/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2012-07-03 00:25:55 &#43;0100">Jul 3, 2012</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If you’re using the excellent <a title="A command-line tool for converting between various document formats." href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html">Pandoc</a> to convert between different document formats, and you:</p>
<ul>
<li>want your final output to be in HTML;</li>
<li>want the HTML to be styled with CSS;</li>
<li>and want the HTML document to be truly standalone;</li>
</ul>
<p>then read on.</p>
<p>The most common approach with Pandoc is, I think, to write in <a title="Plain-text writing for the web." href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, and then convert the output to RTF, PDF or HTML. There are all sorts of more advanced options too; but here we are only concerned with HTML.</p>
<p>The <code>pandoc</code> command has an option which allows you to style the resulting HTML with CSS. <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demos.html">Example 3</a> in the User’s Guide shows how you do this, with the <code>-c</code> option. The example also uses the <code>-s</code> option, which means that we are creating a standalone HTML document, as distinct from a fragment that is to be embedded in another document. The full command is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">pandoc -s -S --toc -c pandoc.css -A footer.html README -o example3.html
</code></pre></div><p>If you inspect the generated HTML file after running this, you will see it contains a line like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;stylesheet&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;pandoc.css&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;text/css&#34;</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>That links to the CSS stylesheet, keeping the formatting information separate from the content. Very good practice if you’re publishing a document on the web.</p>
<p>But what about that “standalone” idea that you expressed with the <code>-s</code> option? What that does is make sure that the HTML is a complete document, beginning with a <code>DOCTYPE</code> tag, an <code><html></code> tag, and so on. But if, for example, you have to email the document you just created, or upload it to your company’s document store, then things fall apart. When your reader opens it, they’ll see what you wrote, all right; but it won’t be styled the way you wanted it. Because that <code>pandoc.css</code> file with the styling is back on your machine, in the same directory as the original Markdown file.</p>
<p>What you really want is to use embedded CSS; you want the content of <code>pandoc.css</code> to be included along with the prose you wrote in your HTML file.</p>
<p>Luckily HTML supports that, and Pandoc provides a way to make it all happen: the <code>-H</code> option, or using its long form, <code>&ndash;include-in-header=FILE</code></p>
<p>First you’ll have to make sure that your <code>pandoc.css</code> file<sup><a id="fnref1" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> starts and ends with HTML <code><style></code> tags, so it should look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">style</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;text/css&#34;</span>&gt;

    <span style="color:#66d9ef">margin</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">auto</span>;
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">padding-right</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">em</span>;
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">padding-left</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">em</span>;
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">max-width</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">44</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">em</span>; 
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">border-left</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">solid</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">black</span>;

&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">style</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Then run the <code>pandoc</code> command like this:</p>

<p>The Radio 1 Hackney Weekend festival was fabulously well organised, loads of fun, and passed off with only three arrests.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Booking the tickets a month or two ago had turned out to be easy (we sat with multiple browsers and phones as the SeeTickets site crumpled, but in fact it was no trouble at all after we left it for a while). Being local residents helped, as half the tickets were for Hackney households.</p>
<p>It was a free show, so there were restrictions; most notably that you could only book for one of the two days, and only two tickets per person. We were doing it for the kids; and the kids in this family (to say nothing of most of their friends) favoured the Sunday lineup; so that&rsquo;s the one we went for.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/events/e9wmxj/performances">The lineup</a> leaned heavily to the various dance subgenres: (modern) R&amp;B, dubstep, and so on. Not forgetting hip-hop, of course; not only did Jay-Z headline the first night, he guested with Rihanna on the second.</p>
<img class="alignright" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px solid black;" title="Jessie J on the main stage" src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_1710.jpg" alt="Hackney Weekend: Jessie J on the main stage" width="407" height="383">
<p>For me the highlight of the day was Jessie J; though I was mildly disappointed that she censored herself in my favourite of her songs, &lsquo;Do it Like a Dude&rsquo;.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Tinie Tempah was also good, though since I&rsquo;ve subsequently been listening to Enter Shikari, I&rsquo;m slightly disappointed to have missed them as they clashed with Tinie.</p>
<p>There was great secrecy and much speculation over who the &ldquo;Special Guest&rdquo; was to be. They managed to keep it hidden until the day, which, while impressive in its way, had me worried. I thought that, depending on who it was, there could be a disaster. In particular, if it had been Justin Bieber, as some kids were speculating, there would have been a vast, simultaneous, two-way flow, from and to the stage (my kids would have been running away from the stage; there are no Beliebers at Devilgate Towers).</p>
<p>Not long before the guest&rsquo;s time I heard on good authority that it was going to be Beyoncé. Believable, as her hubbie was there, and she was said to be &ldquo;in the house&rdquo;. But I doubted it: isn&rsquo;t she a bigger name than Rihanna? And anyway, I get the sense that she&rsquo;d be too much of a diva to go on second on the bill.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the end it was Dizzee Rascal, which with hindsight made total sense, what with him being a local boy and all.</p>
<img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px solid black;" title="Flags" src="http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_1655.jpg" alt="Hackney Weekend: colourful flags" width="431" height="348" border="0">
<p>As we wandered through the stages and the day, we heard snatches of Rihanna&rsquo;s &lsquo;We Found Love&rsquo; seven times (I started keeping count at the third) from various between-act DJs and stalls. So by the time it closed the night, I was thoroughly ready to hear it properly. And a damn fine ending it was, too (though the fireworks were a tad tame).</p>
<p>I was hugely impressed with the organisation of the thing. We got there nice and early, and there was hardly any queueing, despite the airport-style security. The staff were all lovely and friendly, and &ndash; get this &ndash; there was hardly ever a queue for the toilets!</p>
<p>I would strongly support any moves to make it a regular thing. Radio 1&rsquo;s event moves around the country, so it couldn&rsquo;t stay free, but I could easily see it working as a commercial festival in the future.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><a href="www.sci-fi-london.com">The London International Festival of Science Fiction and Fantastic Film, or Sci-Fi-London</a> is in its eleventh year, and I've never been to anything in it before.  That's kind of bad, isn't it?
<p>This week, though, I&rsquo;ve been to the <a href="http://www.bsfa.co.uk/bsfa-awards/2012-clarke-award-winner-announced/">presentation</a> of the <a href="http://www.clarkeaward.com/">Clarke Award</a>, which is held in association with the festival, and at its main venue; and last night, the whole family went to the BFI (or the NFT, I can&rsquo;t quite work out what its official name is these days) to see a film.</p>
<p>Which was <cite><a href="http://dimensionsthemovie.com/">Dimensions</a></cite>, a low-budget British film about time travel &ndash; or maybe dimension-hopping &ndash; which doesn&rsquo;t even have a distributor yet.</p>
<p>Which is a great shame, because despite some flaws it is a very enjoyable piece.  We were still talking about it at lunchtime today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also something of a costume drama, being set in the 1920s and 30s.  The <a href="http://www.sci-fi-london.com/festival/2012/programme/feature/dimensions">Sci-Fi-London page about it</a> likens it to Merchant-Ivory.</p>
<p>It did show its low-budget nature in one or two places, but nothing that destroys the overall effect.  The couple who made it (Ant Neely wrote and composed the original music, and Sloane U’Ren directed and did much else) had to sell their house to fund it, so almost anything can be forgiven.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say too much more about it here, but if you ever get a chance to see it, you should take it.</p>
<p>There was a Q&amp;A with writer, director, lead actor &amp; editor after the screening, which was very interesting.  I was geared up to ask a question, which would have gone something like this: &ldquo;When you make a time-travel story, especially in Britain, you&rsquo;re walking among some long shadows, especially Wells and <cite>Doctor Who</cite>; to what extent would you acknowledge those as influences?&rdquo;  I had my hand up to speak, when the interviewer asked a question touching on exactly those points.  So I didn&rsquo;t ask.  Pity.  I would also have mentioned the fact that they have a mysterious wise man know only as &ldquo;the Professor&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Anyway, lots of fun: highly recommended.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Time to hit the polling booths again. Doesn't seem that long since the last one. But it's a lot easier to decide this time. Brian Paddick's a decent guy, but the Lib Dems have shown they can't be trusted over the last two years. 
<p>Boris hasn&rsquo;t been quite the disaster we feared four years ago, but he still cares more about the richer members of society than everyone else. Plus, he&rsquo;s a Tory. But I repeat myself.</p>
<p>Ken seems kind of past his peak, but he&rsquo;s still the one for the job. Though I might give Jenny Jones my first vote and Ken my second. I think that&rsquo;s what I did last time, come to think o it.</p>
<p>For the Assembly it&rsquo;s going to be Labour all the way. I&rsquo;m not impressed with how they&rsquo;re doing in opposition at Westminster: the Tories are down, but they don&rsquo;t seem to be kicking. Kick harder, Milliband!  But to run London?  Obviously it&rsquo;s got to be the (relatively) good guys.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s surprising and slightly scary is the number of extreme-right parties who have put candidates up. obviously there&rsquo;s the BNP and UKIP: but who knew the National Front were still around?  Then there&rsquo;s ones with names like England First and Christians Against Marriage Equality. (Those names may not be exact, but I&rsquo;m on the Tube at the time of writing, so I can&rsquo;t check; but you get the gist.)</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s where we are today. Don&rsquo;t forget to vote if you can, folks.</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>There were three slightly weird law-enforcement- or intelligence-related stories in the news today:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/30/northern-ireland-murder-police-officer">Two jailed in Northern Ireland over police officer's murder</a>.
<p>I heard the policeman&rsquo;s wife on the radio.  She <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-17552797">spoke calmly</a> about how getting the murderers off the streets was good for the community, and positively about the people who had bravely given evidence (at least one had to be given protection).</p>
<p>The odd, disturbing, and intelligence-community-related thing is that army intelligence had a tracker device in the car of one of the murderers, and at first they refused to reveal its details to the police undertaking the investigation.  The police had to threaten to get a warrant.  Then when they did provide the data, it turned out to have sections mysteriously missing.  You have to sympathise with the <abbr title="Police Service of Northern Ireland">PSNI</abbr> here: they had both the Continuity IRA bampots and the army working against them.</li></p>
<li><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17562112">'Dark Arts' involved in MI6 officer's death</a>.
<p>So what, this GCHQ codebreaker on secondment locked himself inside a bag using magic?  I&rsquo;m surprised that they&rsquo;re even considering that it might <em>not</em> be murder here; or at least that someone has covered something up.  More importantly, there&rsquo;s the fact that the DNA evidence got <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/30/gareth-williams-death-dna-error">messed up by a typo</a>.  Surely there&rsquo;s got to be a better way?</p></li></p>
<li><p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-linked-to-crime-gangs-deleted-records-7601291.html">Police officers deleted records of crime gangs</a>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this business about the corruption in the Met.  Evidence allegedly deleted on the orders of crime gangs?  That&rsquo;s some scary stuff.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that when the Serious Organised Crime Agency was set up, it was meant to be <em>anti</em>-organised crime.</p></li></p>
</ul>
<p>No real connection between these, I just heard about them all today.</p></body></html>

<p>It&rsquo;s also just long; and technical.  So feel free to ignore.  I won&rsquo;t be offended.</p>
<p>I rarely write about programming or other technical issues here, but I probably should do so more often.  Certainly in a case like this.</p>
<p>I often think about the many, many problems that I&rsquo;ve had help with from strangers on the internet; people who have taken the time to write blog posts, answers to questions on forums, or technology tutorials.  My job would barely be possible at times without the web.  Of course, we didn&rsquo;t have it back when I started in 1987; but we didn&rsquo;t do such complex things, with so many different languages and technologies.</p>
<p>Anyway, all these kind strangers have helped me, and I rarely find myself in a position to give anything back to the community.  So since I recently hit a problem that no-one else seems to have had, it&rsquo;s really my duty to describe it, and my solution, in the hope that it might be of use to someone down the line.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the solution to the problem with pass-by reference on WAS, and don&rsquo;t want to read the story of how I got there, you can jump straight to <a href="#newbug">The New Bug</a></p>
</p><h2>Background</h2>
<p>We develop our main app using a fairly standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">n-tier</a> architecture using <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/overview.html">JEE</a>: web front end using JSPs and Struts; EJBs; a multiplicity of database platforms accessed using Spring.  All fairly standard stuff, whose purpose is to move financial messages around.</p>
<p>A lot of this was originally developed when I wasn&rsquo;t around (I was seconded to another department) and by contractors and others who are no longer with us.  So I take no responsibility for the stupidities that exist in codebase.  Or rather, I accept no blame.  I do, in fact, have responsibility for it; for keeping it going and developing it onwards now.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the bad choices that was made by the original developers of this version of the product, was that they should cache the results of database queries.  The users can define various criteria by which they want to select a set of messages to view; those get translated into SQL, which our Java code executes using JDBC.  Again, all standard stuff.  JDBC was designed for exactly that kind of thing.  Databases exist solely to do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So the wise and sensible developers decided that performance would be a problem if a query returned many rows from the database.  They decided that transferring the rows to the browser and allowing the user to scroll through them would be impossible.  So they designed a caching mechanism.</p>
<p>Thing is, JDBC has that kind of caching built right in.  And furthermore, they (our developers) included a limit: a maximum number of rows to return, which could be set to 50, 100, 500, or 1000.  Pretty reasonable, since any query that returned over 200 or so rows is likely to be less than useful, anyway.</p>
<p>But they still built that caching mechanism.</p>
<h2>The Mechanism</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all right, though, I hear you say.  Cache the rows server-side in memory, return a subset to the user as they page through them.  It sounds fine.</p>
<p>True enough.  Except they didn&rsquo;t cache them in memory.  Oh no.  That would have been too sensible.  And might have caused performance problems (I&rsquo;m sure they thought, if they even considered they matter).  No, they cached them elsewhere.  Where?  In the database.</p>
<p>Yes, they introduced another table; a shadow table; an almost-identical duplicate of the <code>Messages</code> table, called <code>MessageQueryResults</code>.  Executing a query then consisted of selecting the required rows and writing them into this table, keyed by the HTTP session ID; and then re-querying this results table to get a page worth of results.</p>
<p>So, to recap, then: to improve performance (<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization">without first determining that there was actually a problem</a>), they replaced a simple database read with a read, a set of writes, and another set of reads.</p>
<p>That was <em>bound</em> to perform better, right?</p>
<h2>The Failure</h2>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t performance that brought this flimsy edifice crashing down, though.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> No, it actually ran quite successfully for several years.  Three things brought about its end: Microsoft, multiplicity, and me.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s part was through their database platform, SQL Server.  Between one version and another they changed something about their storage mechanism, so that you could no longer rely on rows on a table being in the sequence in which they were written to the table.  The thing is, you&rsquo;re not <em>supposed</em> to be able to rely on that, according to DB theory.  That was another flaw in the &ldquo;design&rdquo; above; it relied on the shadow table&rsquo;s rows being returned in the same sequence they were written in.  On Oracle and DB2 that worked; and it did on SQL Server too, until (if memory serves) the 2005 version.  This meant that clients on that platform who had large queries couldn&rsquo;t rely on them being displayed in the right order.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>Hacks were applied to sort this out.  Pun intended: sorting is pretty much what they did.  Not a fix, but a workaround at best.</p>
<p>The multiplicity part was that the same mechanism was used to query another table; and then a third.  And there was a fourth on the horizon.  Each new table meant a new shadow table which had to be maintained in parallel &ndash; and whose creation and upgrade scripts had to be maintained across three database platforms.  A maintenance nightmare.</p>
<p>Then there was me.  I had known about the problem for some time, of course &ndash; I had done an estimate for fixing it &ndash; but there was never time to fix it.  It was a big task, quite intrusive, and showing no easily-provable customer benefit.  Yes, I know ease of maintenance, by making life easier for developers, is an implicit customer benefit; but try selling that to management, when there are customers crying out for new features.</p>
<p>But in the project that was to introduce the fourth table (or seventh and eighth, you might say) I was in a position to say, &ldquo;we fix this first, or it all goes to hell&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The user story was written.  I got my estimate out of hibernation (and increased it, of course).  And then I did the fix.  It was a great joy.  That in-memory caching mechanism I mentioned above?  I did that.   If I&rsquo;d been designing it from scratch I would almost certainly have relied on JDBC&rsquo;s internal caching, at least until it proved problematic.  But under the circumstances, when the code relied on there being a cache, it was going to be much less disruptive to retain one.  I just replaced the stupid one with a more sensible one.</p>
<p>Inevitably, though, I introduced a new bug.</p>
<h2><a id="newbug"></a>The New Bug</h2>
<p>This is where I stop telling a story and start explaining the problem and solution.</p>
<p>Introducing the new message caching mechanism, which replaced the <code>MessageQueryResults</code> table, inadvertently caused a problem when we set a WAS server to pass-by-reference mode.</p>
<p>This mode is recommended when the different tiers of the application (web, EJB) are running in the same JVM.  This is normally the case in our test environments, and frequently the case in client systems.  Enabling this mode removes the need for objects to be copied as they are passed through the tiers, and can improve performance dramatically in such environments.</p>
<h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
<p>Changing the caching mechanism caused no problem as long as pass-by-reference was off.  As soon as it was turned on, we noticed that taking certain actions, such as deleting a message, failed.</p>
<p>The failure was at a point in the code where the a value such as an amount was being retrieved from the <code>Map</code> that formed the new cache.  The failure was that the retrieved <code>Object</code> was being cast to a <code>Number</code>, but what was in the <code>Map</code> entry was actually a <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>This <code>Map</code> comes, by a fairly complex set of steps, from the new cache, and before that from the database itself, of course.</p>
<p>Now, since the <code>Amount</code> column on the DB is numeric, and the <code>Map</code> in question is originally populated via Spring from the DB, obviously the value was a numeric one originally.  This suggested that the value must have been changed, and that gave us the first clue to tracking down the cause of the problem, and coming up with a solution.</p>
<h2>The Cause</h2>
<p>It seemed likely &ndash; and running debug, it was shown to be so &ndash; that the numeric value that was retrieved from the database and stored in the <code>Map</code> was being replaced by the edited value which is built for displaying.  In other words, the object now contained a <code>String</code> holding digits, a decimal point, and probably commas.</p>
<h2>Why it Changed When We Switched on Pass-By-Reference</h2>
<p>When the data was being passed by value, a new <code>Map</code>, complete with its contents, was being passed from the EJB layer to the webapp.  The webapp then updated values in that <code>Map</code>, editing them for display purposes.  But it was only changing its own copy; it had no effect on the version stored back in the EJB layer.  So when the same <code>Map</code> was retrieved again, so that the action could be performed, a new copy was received by the webapp.  No problem.</p>
<p>But when pass-by-reference is on, no copy is made.  The webapp receives a reference to the actual <code>Map</code> that is stored in the cache back in the EJB layer.  So when it updates an entry in that <code>Map</code>, it updates the very object that is stored in the cache (note that the <code>put</code> method of the <code>Map</code> interface will update the stored value if it receives a key that it already holds).</p>
<p>And then when the <code>Map</code> and its entry are retrieved again for the action to be performed, it is the updated (and now wrong) version that is retrieved.</p>
<h2>Why it Changed When We Changed the Caching Mechanism</h2>
<p>And yet both possible passing settings were available before we changed the caching mechanism.  Why did we not get this problem when using pass-by-reference with the old caching mechanism?</p>
<p>The answer to that is that the old mechanism cached the query results in the database itself, in the <code>MessageQueryResults</code> table.  Each time a set of results was requested by the webapp, the EJB layer went back to this temporary table and populated the <code>Map</code> that it returned to the webapp.  So the amount value would always have been set up freshly from the numeric <code>Amount</code> column, which ensured that it was an object of type <code>Number</code>.</p>
<h2>The Fix</h2>
<p>I tried making copies of the <code>Map</code>s and <code>List</code>s used, at various points in the process, including using <code>ImmutableList</code>s and <code>ImmutableMap</code>s from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/">Google&rsquo;s Guava library</a>, in an attempt to prevent the value object of interest from being updated.  However, it wasn&rsquo;t possible to make them immutable deeply enough (and would probably have caused other problems if it had been).  That was largely because the principal <code>Map</code> is created and populated by Spring, so we don&rsquo;t have much control over it.</p>
<p>One solution &ndash; and probably the proper one &ndash; would have been to copy the entries from the <code>Map</code> at the point they are read and processed in the webapp.  This would have meant that the edited, <code>String</code>, version of amount would be a different, new object, and would not have been updated in the <code>Map</code> that came from the cache.</p>
<p>However, the vast complexity of the class where this would have had to happen made this seem like a very difficult and dangerous approach, especially at this late point in the project.</p>
<p>An alternative solution was suggested by one of my colleagues.  It was to accept the fact that the amount value might be a <code>String</code> containing a numeric value with commas and decimal point, and to parse the numeric value out of it.</p>
<p>This allowed us to cater for both numeric and string values, and it worked with either form of passing semantics.  But it felt like a hack, and I was sure it would come back to bite us.</p>
<h2>Fixing the Fix, a Little Later</h2>
<p>It did.  The trigger this time was paging through the list of results; when you returned to a page you had already seen, you ended up with an object of the wrong kind coming out of the <code>Map</code>.  If memory serves it was a <code>String</code> where it should have been a <code>Date</code>.</p>
<p>It was clearly another result of the data being edited for display and updated in-place in the <code>Map</code>.  There are too many possible places in in the relevant method to rely on finding them all, so I returned to the &ldquo;probably the proper&rdquo; solution mentioned above.  I changed the relevant method such that it now returns a copy of the <code>List</code> containing the required subset of the query results.  This is less straightforward than might be hoped, because copying a <code>List</code>, including by the <code>clone</code> method of the implementing class, for example, tends to do a &ldquo;shallow copy&rdquo;, which means that you get a new <code>List</code> instance, but containing references to the same objects.</p>
<p>I wrote a method called <code>copyList</code>, which iterates over a <code>List</code> and makes &ldquo;deep&rdquo; copies of a few expected types of object.  We may have to extend this method to handle other types, but I don&rsquo;t expect that at the moment.</p>
<h2>Also Worth Noting</h2>
<p>There is a warning about this on IBM&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/bestpractices/ejbs_and_servlets_using_pass_by_reference.html">Best Practice: Using pass by reference for EJBs and servlets if in same JVM</a> page, but it&rsquo;s one of those typical contrived kind of examples that probably wouldn&rsquo;t really alert you to the possibility of something like my experience.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>To set the pass-by-reference mode on or off, take the following steps in the WAS administrative console (this is WAS 6, it&rsquo;s probably different at other releases).</p>
<p>Go to <code>Servers -&gt; Application servers -&gt; &lt;server -name&gt;</code></p>
<p>Expand <code>Container Services</code>; click on <code>ORB Service</code>; check/uncheck <code>&ldquo;Pass by reference&rdquo;</code></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>It seems like almost no time at all since I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2010/11/30/nono/">last wrote about</a> not completing <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/en/participants/devilgate">NaNoWriMo</a>.  But here we are again.  A year passes like nothing.
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t strictly following the rules (but they&rsquo;re only really guidelines, and optional at that) in that I wasn&rsquo;t starting a new novel this time.  I was carrying on the same one that I started last year, and I hadn&rsquo;t written many more in the interim.  I managed just under 15,000 words this year, which is slightly less than last time (and less than a tenth of my erstwhile OU Creative Writing classmate Karl&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/en/participants/ksg1981">crazy figure</a>)</p>
<p>It has, however, given me a new kickstart, and I intend to carry the momentum onwards, but at a more manageable rate.  My novel (working title <cite>Accidental Upgrade</cite>) currently stands at around 36,000 words.  I&rsquo;ve set myself a target of 80,000 by the end of February.  That is more like the length of a modern novel, and achievable at a rate of around 475 words a day, according to <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much more feasible for me than Nano&rsquo;s 1667.  Though I&rsquo;m just realising that I said essentially the same thing last year, and it obviously didn&rsquo;t work.  Still, I feel more confident this time.  I wrote around 600 words today, and I&rsquo;ve got Scrivener to help me keep on track.</p></body></html></p>

			 <p>My friend (Wee) John(ny) called a couple of days ago and said, “Do you fancy seeing The Damned at the Roundhouse?”  I’d never been to the Roundhouse, though it was one of those legendary London venues from my teenage years, like the Rainbow and the Hammersmith Palais.  And I hadn’t seen The Damned in (I thought)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> about 26 years.  Not since a seated gig in the Edinburgh Playhouse the night before I had a High-Energy Physics progress test the following morning.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I said “Yes”.  I mean, why the hell not?  I only really know <cite>Machine-Gun Etiquette</cite> and a few singles, but what the hell.  They’re bound to do those, right?  It’s a 35th-anniversary thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/">The Roundhouse</a> is an amazing place.  As a former railway shed, it’s just a stunning space.  But it’s not the seedy old-school venue I half expected, because it’s been closed down and refurbished and reopened since the seventies.  So it’s really nice: more like The Barbican, say, than The Forum.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vivalbertine.com/">Viv Albertine</a> was supporting.  I expected her to have a band, but she just stood up there on her own, with a Telecaster as old as punk, and sang us songs of non-love and stuff.  She was great.</p>
<p>The Damned were… pretty much as I expected, actually.  They came on, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Sensible">Captain</a> said, “We’re going to do two ‘classic’ albums.”  (He did the air-quotes.)  I’m not sure about this recentish trend of doing a whole album live, but expect it could be good.  Mostly, though, I’m amused that for classic punk albums, one would be too short.</p>
<p>So they kicked off into ‘Neat Neat Neat’, and I realised that we were much too close to the front: actually <em>in</em> the moshpit. <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/08/26/hardcore-knows-the-score/">As I&rsquo;ve said</a>, I’m really past that — much though I might enjoy dancing in the abstract, or in private.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was all very wild and excellent, and there were many people with t-shirts of bands I’ve seen or haven’t seen but wish I had or don’t mind that I haven’t but recognise anyway.  In short, I was with, as Neil Gaiman describes it, my tribe.</p>
<p>It was all monstrously fine. Two albums with a break, then a few encores.  Which included, as expected, several non-those-album tracks.  ‘Love Song’, of course, they could hardly have avoided playing.  A couple of others, and then came ‘Eloise’, which, punked-up though it was, we could frankly have done without,</p>
<p>Then they played ‘Anti-pope’ and were gone.  I realise that the Roundhouse must have a strict 11 o’clock policy, but surely they were coming back…?  No.  DJ music and house lights… and no ‘Smash it Up’.  I must admit, if you had asked me before I went out tonight whether there was any chance that they wouldn’t play ‘Smash it Up’, I would have laughed at you.</p>
<p>Very strange.  And then there was a crazy queue to get out of the venue, because so many people had taken up the option to get an instant double CD of tonight’s gig.  They obviously burn them straight from the sound desk while the gig is on.  But it meant that you could hardly get out of the venue.  There has to be a better way than that.</p>
<p>Anyway, my ears are sizzling, and I still owe NaNoWriMo a load of words, so I’ll call it a night here.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Back when John Peel was still with us he played a song called '88 Lines About 44 Women'. I only heard it maybe twice, and never caught the name of the band. Later, when it <a href="http://google.com/">became easy to find things out</a>, I discovered they were called <a href="http://www.the-nails.com/">The Nails</a>. I've recently been rediscovering that very fine song, which I like as much as ever; and I'm pleased to find that there are couple of different versions of it.
<p>(According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nails">the Wikipedia article</a> on the band, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jello_Biafra">Jello Biafra</a> was their roadie, which was a strange and surprising discovery.)</p>
<p>It reminded me that I have a fondness for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_song">list songs</a>, which as you can see from the link, is a sufficiently real genre, or class, that it has its own entry.</p>
<p>So I made a <a href="spotify:user:devilgate:playlist:57HRwBnccSUMINZrJ4s6o6">Spotify playlist</a> of some I like. Click that link if you have Spotify, or <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/devilgate/playlist/57HRwBnccSUMINZrJ4s6o6">this one</a> if you don&rsquo;t. Unfortunately it won&rsquo;t show the contents of the list &ndash; there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an easy way to do that. It will just prompt you to sign up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a song on there by The Beautiful South which, if I remember correctly, was intended to mock the use of women&rsquo;s names in songs. I wonder what they&rsquo;d think of &lsquo;88 Lines About 44 Women&rsquo;.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>For the last two months or so, it seems, I've been listening almost exclusively to a single album.[^fn1] That album is <a href="http://www.davidcomestolife.com/"><cite>David Comes to Life</cite></a> by a Toronto hardcore band called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucked_Up">Fucked Up</a>.
<p>That&rsquo;s hardcore in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk">punk sense</a>, not rap, or anything else.  All genres have a &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo; subgenre, it seems.  I&rsquo;m sure that somewhere there&rsquo;s hardcore pop.</p>
<p>Anyway, this album causes me to put together three words that I never thought I&rsquo;d see in the same sentence, never mind describing the same thing: punk rock opera.</p>
<p>I know, I know, rock operas are the bloated detritus of prog rock, and part of what we fought the punk wars against.  Though truth be told, I&rsquo;ve always been quite fond of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(album)"><cite>Tommy</cite></a>.  But in a sense it was always something that was going to happen eventually.  When a genre or a medium has been around for a while, people will try to take it further than it has gone before, and that&rsquo;s no bad thing.</p>
<p>And when you get right down to it, it&rsquo;s all about storytelling, and who can complain about that?</p>
<p>So I was pointed in the direction of this album by <a href="http://www.sizemore.co.uk/2011/06/23/hello-my-name-is-david/">a post on Mike Sizemore&rsquo;s blog</a>.  Sizemore is a scriptwriter; I probably started reading his blog when someone like <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/">Warren Ellis</a> pointed me at a teaser or &ldquo;<a href="http://vimeo.com/7963572">sizzle</a>&rdquo; video he and some other people made for a prospective science fiction series.</p>
<p>Anyway, he posted a link to the video for the second track off the album, &lsquo;Queen of Hearts&rsquo;, and spoke very highly of it, as you&rsquo;ll have seen if you followed the link.  If you haven&rsquo;t, you should.  Go on, I&rsquo;ll wait.  I watched it a couple of times, and though, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK, interesting premise, I wish I could make out the words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I forget about it for a while.</p>
<p>But one day something made me go back.  I listened again.  I downloaded the album.  I fell in&hellip; not love, exactly, but fascination.</p>
<p>North American hardcore bands have a certain vocal style, which is certainly not to everyone&rsquo;s taste.  In that way, I realised, it&rsquo;s not unlike actual opera.  Sure, the vocal stylings are about as far apart as possible; but they are both very <em>stylised</em>.  And my biggest two problems with opera are that it&rsquo;s hard to make the words out (even when they&rsquo;re singing in english), and that I don&rsquo;t really like the vocal stylings.</p>
<p>Not to everyone&rsquo;s taste, as I said.</p>
<p>Luckily, operas tend to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surtitles">surtitles</a>; and albums have lyric sheets.  The lyrics for <cite>David Comes to Life</cite> are <a href="http://www.davidcomestolife.com/">available on the web</a>, as you might expect.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m writing about this now because I haven&rsquo;t got round to doing so before, but especially because I&rsquo;ve just got back from seeing Fucked Up live.  They were playing at a Shoreditch venue called <a href="http://www.xoyo.co.uk/">XOYO</a> in a &ldquo;co-headliner&rdquo; with a band called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off!_%28band%29">OFF!</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/devilgate">I tweeted</a> a lot about it, and among other things, I expressed a degree of concern as to what it would be like going to a hardcore gig:</p>

<p>Hmm.  Not seen a hardcore gig since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napalm_Death">Napalm Death</a>?  That may well be true, but they&rsquo;re British (and technically grindcore, according to Wikipedia).  I began to wonder whether I&rsquo;d <em>ever</em> seen a US (or Canadian) hardcore band live.  The only one I could think of were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC">Hüsker Dü</a>, whom I saw in Edinburgh in &ndash; oh, 84 or 85.</p>
<p>I feel sure there must have been others, and yet the only such band that I was really, really a fan of was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a>, and if they ever played the UK it happened either without me knowing about it, or they only played far away from where I was, or both.</p>
<p>I needn&rsquo;t have worried, though.  The venue was just the right size, and comfortably packed.  The crowd were gentle and lovely.  The moshpit was pretty wild, but I turned 47 yesterday, which is officially way past too old for the moshpit, and I was well able to stay clear of it.</p>
<p>And it was a totally brilliant night.  The first band, <a href="http://cerebralballzy.com/">Cerebral Ballzy</a>, were on when I arrived, so I heard three or four of their songs.  They sounded pretty good, and more to the point, the sound in the room was excellent.  Clear, and powerful, without being so loud as to be overwhelming.</p>
<p>OFF! were classic hardcore, in that if you didn&rsquo;t like a song there&rsquo;d be another along in way less than three minutes.  I thoroughly enjoyed them.</p>
<p>And Fucked Up just ruled.  I was thinking before they came on that I would leave happy as long as they played &lsquo;Queen of Hearts&rsquo;  And they duly opened with it!  They then proceeded to play edited highlights from <cite>David Comes to Life</cite>, interspersed with a few other tracks.  There was stage-diving, crowd-surfing, the singer diving topless into the audience and walking almost to the back of the venue while still singing (and using a wired mike, with a very long cable).</p>
<p>Anyway, if you&rsquo;ve read to the end of this rambling thing, you should go and listen to some things.  Here&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Queen of Hearts&rsquo; video, and it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever embedded a video.  Let&rsquo;s hope it works.  Note that this version has the kids in the video singing on it, which is not how it is on the album, but is very cool nonetheless.</p>

<p>And the second video from the album, &lsquo;The Other Shoe&rsquo;, which they also did tonight.</p>

			 <p>It has come to my attention that there are some of you who are not aware of two of the best British comedy programmes to come out over the last year or so.  Both have links to <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/green-wing"><cite>Green Wing</cite></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, which was, of course, famously described (by me) as “the funniest thing since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolutely_(TV_series)"><cite>Absolutely</cite></a>“.</p>
<p>First we have <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1582350/"><cite>Episodes</cite></a> (actually a British-American coproduction), starring Tamsin Greig and Stephen Mangan, in which a married-couple writing team go to Hollywood to adapt their hit British comedy show for the American market.  It also stars Matt LeBlanc, playing himself.  Yes, it’s all very meta, and what’s wrong with that?</p>
<p>Then there’s <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/comedy-showcase/episode-guide/series-7/episode-1"><cite>Campus</cite></a>, which has some of the <cite>Green Wing</cite> writing team, and could lazily be described as “<cite>Green Wing</cite>, but set in a university instead of a hospital”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If you are one such person, then I slightly envy you: you still have these joys ahead of you.  And with both of them, don’t worry if the first episode doesn’t overwhelm you; just watch the next, and you’ll be hooked.</p>

			 <p>I’ve not really had many dealings with the Huffington Post, but I thought I’d drop a comment on <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-vazquez/embed-ciode-test-nerermin_b_899994.html">this piece about a cover versions album of Nirvana’s <cite>Nevermind</cite></a>. The writer, Michael Vazquez, describes himself as being ‘part of the generation that just-missed Punk’, and goes on to say he’s 45.</p>
<p>Thing is, I’m just a year older, and I didn’t miss it. I lived right through it. Not, it’s true, at its bleeding, safety-pin-punctured heart.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But still, I was aware of it, was introduced to the music by friends, listened to Peelie. Formed <em>bands</em>, for god’s sake, which is what it was really all about.</p>
<p>I can only conclude that Vazquez was a late developer.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point wasn’t about that, it was about commenting at the Huffington Post. You have to be registered to comment; fair enough, that probably keeps the spam down a bit. There are a number of login options, as is common nowadays: Twitter, Facebook, a dropdown for others.</p>
<p>I tried the dropdown and chose to use my Google account. A popup pops up, saying, ‘This site wants to know your email address and your contacts.’ Email address, fair enough, that’s normal for registering at most places. But my Google contacts? I think not.</p>
<p>I cancelled, tried Twitter. ‘This site wants to see your contacts, add contacts, post tweets…’ Get, as we say in my part of the world, tae fuck!</p>
<p>Oddly, it asked less of Facebook; but I can’t be bothered going back to check exactly what.</p>
<p>In the end, not wanting to be thwarted, I registered with them by giving them a username and my email address, in the old-school way. Obviously I unchecked the ‘Please spam me’ box.</p>
<p>Is this normal behaviour nowadays? Certainly seems odd to me.</p>

			 <html><body><p>There's a campaign on Facebook encouraging people to boycott News International papers for life.  I'm way ahead of them.  I don't touch anything from the Murdoch empire.[^fn1]
<p>I haven&rsquo;t ever since the days of the Tories.  Err, the old days of the Tories, I mean: the eighties; Thatcher; all that stuff we thought we&rsquo;d done away with in 1997.</p>
<p>My reasons are much the same as those I wrote about in my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2002/12/13/when-do-we-forgive/">fourth ever blog entry</a>.  Then, I was talking about the Saatchis, and how their name was anathema to me, because of the fact that they had helped the Tories get in all through the Eighties.</p>
<p>I have long held a similar despite for the Murdoch papers; enhanced by the tabloid ones being such trivial pedlars of rubbish and prurience.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>My kids occasionally complain about the fact that we don&rsquo;t have Sky, but there are so many channels on Freeview (and <cite>Friends</cite> and <cite>My Name Is Earl</cite> are on E4 so often) that I don&rsquo;t think they really mind.</p>
<p>And I must confess that, until the now-aborted bid to take 100% ownership of Sky, I thought Murdoch <em>did</em> own all of it.  Turns out we could have watched 60% of it for all those years.</p>
<p>No matter how negatively I feel towards the organisation and its organs, though, I would never have expected the degree of criminality that they were apparently practising; just as no matter how negatively I might sometimes have felt about the police, I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected such casual corruption from them.  In the end I think we&rsquo;ll understand that the police taking money from journalists is the worst thing about all this.</p>
<p>And yet on some level I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m that surprised; disappointed, certainly, but not really surprised.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all unravelling now, though, and we watch with joy and bated breath.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I’m sure we all use the word “disgusted” too easily.  But I felt physically sick when I first heard about the <cite>News of the World</cite> (or someone working on its behalf) allegedly <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jul/04/milly-dowler-voicemail-hacked-news-of-world" title="Guardian report on Milly Dowler's phone being hacked">‘hacking’ Milly Dowler’s phone</a>.</p>
<p>It’s only a few days since her murderer was convicted, and now this comes down.  It’s hard to believe that anyone, in any occupation can sink so low.  But of course, it gets worse: they seem to have done it to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14035270" title="Sarah Wells and Jessica Chapman's families told about phone hacking">the families of other murdered girls, too</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, obviously they’re not as low as the bampots who actually did the murders.  But not by much.</p>
<p>I’m a profound believer in free speech, and know that a free press is essential to a functioning democracy.  But shit like this works against those noble ideals.  It’s not exercising our freedoms to ensure that we keep them; it’s abusing them, and so making it more likely that they’ll be curtailed.</p>
<p>Because the backlash is coming, News Corp; already <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/05/news-of-the-world-ford-advertising?intcmp=239" title="Ford pulling ads from NotW">advertisers are starting to withdraw</a> from your spiteful rag.  (And I hope that some good can come of this: that the public will finally see what hideous, mean-spirited rags tabloid papers are, and start to boycott them.)  But bigger than that is that fact there is now <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/05/cameron-parliament-phone-hacking-inquiry?intcmp=239" title="Calls for a phone-hacking inquiry">bound to be an inquiry</a>.</p>
<p>And it seems to me that there is a strong chance that such an inquiry will recommend introducing some kind of statutory regulation of newspapers.  And then we’d all suffer.</p>

			 <html><body><p>The Saturday before last we went to the [London Feis Festival 2011](http://londonfeis.com/), in Finsbury Park.  The weather was looking to be quite bad as we set out: it had been oscillating between sun and rain all morning.  Would we be drenched or sunburned?  Or both?  Only time would tell.
<p>I had been hitting the festival website to try to find out who was on when, exactly.  There was a page which said (and still does, a the time of writing), &lsquo;<a href="http://londonfeis.com/event-info/">Band and Stage Times: To be released on the day</a>&rsquo;.  I had taken that to mean, &lsquo;&hellip; will be announced on the website on the day&rsquo;.  I did wonder about how much use that would be, considering many people would be getting on their way early in the morning, or the night before, and wouldn&rsquo;t have had the chance to look at the website.  Then again, everyone has a smartphone nowadays, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, it turned out that they meant, &hellip;. will be released at the festival.'  On the bus to Finsbury Park I searched Twitter for the expected #feis hashtag, wherein some nice person had tweeted pictures of the running order (I can&rsquo;t find those pictures now, but no matter).  It appeared we were missing The Undertones, but we would get there in time for The Waterboys.</p>
<p>As indeed we did.  We set up base camp near the back and listened to &lsquo;Be My Enemy&rsquo; (timely, as I recently read Christopher Brookmyre&rsquo;s novel which borrows that title) &lsquo;Fisherman&rsquo;s Blues&rsquo;, &lsquo;&hellip; And a Bang on the Ear&rsquo;, and of course, &lsquo;The Whole of the Moon&rsquo;.  It was great to see them again.  Well, hear them; we didn&rsquo;t see much from the back, and there were no big screens like at most festivals these days.</p>
<p>A trip to the second stage saw us Nanci Griffith, closely followed by Shane McGowan.  Always good to see he&rsquo;s still hanging in there, and he was in excellent voice.  I note that it&rsquo;s an alarming four and half years since I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2006/01/06/the-rocky-pogue-to-brixton/">last saw The Pogues</a>.</p>

<br>
<p>Heard a bit of The Cranberries while queueing for toilet and bar.  They were OK.  Some Irish youngsters at the bar sang along with &lsquo;Linger&rsquo; very sweetly.</p>
<p>Then back to the main stage for Christy Moore, food, and finally Dylan.</p>
<img src="https://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_4810.jpg" alt="Bob Dylan at the London Feis, 2011" title="IBob Dylan at the London Feis, 2011" border="0" width="600" height="450" style="float:left;">
<br>
<p>That&rsquo;s him there in the white hat; can you tell?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long wait for me.  I know he&rsquo;s been over here in the last few years, but somehow I&rsquo;ve never managed to hear about the dates until it was too late.  Here we were, then, finally in the distant presence of the great man himself.</p>
<p>And it was, as I expected, like listening to him doing cover versions of his own songs.  But there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.  It was quite a &lsquo;greatest hits&rsquo; kind of set, though, to my surprise.  I had gained the impression that he mainly did newer songs these days, but there was a strong focus on <cite>Blood on the Tracks</cite> and <cite>Highway 61 Revisited</cite>.  And you can&rsquo;t go far wrong with those.  <a href="http://www.examiner.com/bob-dylan-in-national/bob-dylan-set-list-london-feis-2011-finsbury-park-june-18-2011">Here&rsquo;s a full set list</a>.</p>
<p>The only possible singalong moment was the &lsquo;How does it feel?&rsquo; lines in &lsquo;Like Rolling Stone&rsquo;, and it made me wonder: maybe he started doing such changed versions of his songs because he doesn&rsquo;t like people singing along.</p>
<p>I thought this stall would do roaring trade, but the rain mostly stayed off.</p>

<br>
<p>Then Sunday was <a href="http://www.bl.uk/sciencefiction">Out of this World</a>, the Science Fiction thing at the British Library.  &lsquo;Science Fiction, but not as you know it&rsquo;, was the tag line.  In fact, it was pretty much exactly as i know it, but I guess I&rsquo;m part of some sort of rarefied elite, or something (or &lsquo;fans&rsquo; as we&rsquo;re known).</p>
<p>Anyway, it was very good, though perhaps it&rsquo;s limiting, being a library: much of the exhibition was books behind glass.  Which is fine, but sometimes you&rsquo;d like to pick them up and handle them.</p>
<p>There was a Tardis in a corner of the Time Travel section, and a robot that seemed to be modelled on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000">HAL 9000</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I saw him at a solo gig once, during the year I worked in Turin. He did a load of blues and rock standards, some of his own, and a couple of Springsteen songs. “Well what did you expect?” he said, “The Big Man wouldn’t be The Big Man without The Boss.”</p>
<p>And I saw the E-Street Band on the <cite>Born in the USA</cite> tour, where his sax, of course, tore the house down.  Always a neat trick at an outdoor gig.</p>
<p>Sad to see him go.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Prospective -- or actual -- writers are always given the advice, 'show, don't tell.'  It's considered to be more engaging as a storytelling technique to let your reader know what's happening by letting them experience it via the experiences of your characters, rather than merely informing them what happens to your characters.
<p>Good enough advice, in general.  But there are always counterexamples.</p>
<p>This morning on the way to work I read a story on Tor&rsquo;s website, which is almost entirely telling; and almost entirely wonderful.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This morning I heard John Humphrys haul the Prime Minister over the coals regarding the behaviour of the “No to AV” campaign.  Cameron tried to separate the “Conservative No” campaign from the rest of the No campaign, while failing to condemn the outright lies told by the broader campaign.  It was a remarkable piece of squirming, and decidedly unconvincing.</p>
<p>He then went on to use the “one person one vote” argument.  This asserts that under AV, some people’s votes are counted more than once.  It ignores the fact that <em>every</em> voter can specify a list of preferences, of course, but it also seems to take an over-literal interpretation of the word “count”.  True, if my first preference is eliminated (under AV), my second preference is counted, which means that in some sense my ballot paper (or the entries on it) must be counted again; but ultimately the preferences I state are only applied towards one candidate.  My paper only “counts” towards one person.</p>
<p>Alternatively, consider it a minor redefinition of what a “vote” is.  Instead of meaning a single “X” placed in a single box, it means a set of one or more preferences specified on a ballot paper.  “One person, one paper,” you could say.</p>
<p>And last night I heard a “Referendum Broadcast” by the No campaign.  It was incredibly stupid, too; and again by being over-literal.  It analogised an AV-based election as a horse race, in which horse A came first, but the victory was awarded to third-placed horse C.  Everyone was very confused.  Because AV is so complex that nobody can understand it.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/kk2lZ.jpg">Here’s a picture</a> that shows the complexities of the two systems.</p>
<p>Come on, say “Yes” on Thursday.</p>

			 <html><body><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Beukes">Lauren Beukes</a> has <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/04/congrats-to-2011-clarke-award-winner-lauren-beukes">just won the Clarke Award</a> with her <cite>Zoo City</cite>.  Congratulations to her, and all.</p>
<p>I just finished reading her <cite>Moxyland</cite>, which I was given at last year’s Eastercon, and… I’m not so impressed.</p>
<p><cite>Strange Horizons</cite> has a good <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2009/11/two_views_moxyl.shtml">dual review</a> of it.  I <em>kind of</em> enjoyed it, especially towards the end.  But in many ways I found it annoying, and I’ve been trying to work out exactly why that is.</p>
<p>Part of it is the characters, I think.  I don’t mind unsympathetic — even unpleasant — characters.  But I think the main problem with these ones is that it’s hard to tell their voices apart, and since the story is told from multiple first-person viewpoints, that’s a problem.</p>
<p>But I think the biggest point of disconnection for me was technological: there is one particular item that made my disbelief-suspension system collapse in despair.</p>
<p>Because I can easily believe in a near future where your phone takes the place of both credit cards and cash, where it is the heart and soul of your identity, and to be disconnected would make you an unperson.  But even supposing that phones could be engineered to give their owners a taser-like shock at the command of any police officer (what if your battery is low?); even supposing that a society would not rise up in protest at the madness of a government requiring its citizens to possess such a thing; and even supposing that it all worked: I <em>can’t</em> believe that nobody would carry them in thick rubber pockets.</p>
<p>So in the end, in a novel containing much about political activism, it’s the political acquiescence of its imagined society that crashed me out of the story too often.</p>
<p>Still, it was her first novel, and shows much promise, so I expect that <cite>Zoo City</cite> will be a worthy winner.</p>

			 <html><body><p>eMusic got back to me.  As <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/03/23/emusic-and-re-downloading/">I said</a>, I emailed them to complain about the disappearance of re-downloading.</p>
<p>Randall, from eMusic Customer Support, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It would be great if we could offer the privilege of re-downloading music for free to our members, but the truth of the matter is that our agreements with our labels prohibit us from doing so
</p></blockquote>
<p>which is not surprising.  But why the recent change?</p>
<blockquote><p>
  while we have not had the tracking systems in place to enforce it before, we do now.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I see.  He went on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
  we believe it is the best policy for everyone involved because ultimately it benefits the artists that we all love.
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not convinced.  It is in the sense that, if I want to get the albums I lost, I’ll have to buy them again, so the artists get paid again.  But I’d be surprised if many artists really want to get paid more because of something that could be seen as ripping off their fans.</p>
<p>Though I suppose the comparison would be that if I had broken or lost a CD (or scratched a record, for us old types) I wouldn’t get it replaced for free.</p>
<p>But digital files, being so ephemeral, just feel like they belong in a different category.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am 98.763% convinced that they used to let you re-download tracks that you had downloaded before.  So imagine my dismay, when taking, I thought, the final few steps in recovering from my <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/devilgate/status/46594393410506752">recent disk replacement</a>.  Just download the recent Emusic tracks that I hadn’t backed up, right?</p>
<p>Oh, no.  Not any more.  Re-downloading is <a href="http://www.emusic.com/contact/download_preamble.html#redownload">only for failed downloads</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve emailed them about it, but I’m not expecting much.  Not happy, Emusic.  Not happy.</p>

			 <html><body><p>It occurs to me that software companies, like the one I work for, are probably considered part of the 'service sector', in the kind of statistics that you hear on the news from time to time.  Like most such companies, we do provide services.  But at our core, we make and sell <em>things</em> -- computer programs.  The fact that the <em>things</em> are delivered by FTP rather than DHL does not make them any less things.
<p>In short, we should be considered as part of the &lsquo;manufacturing sector&rsquo;; or at least as some sort of hybrid.  The national statistics are therefore skewed, and the UK probably has a far larger manufacturing sector than we are generally told.</p>

			 <html><body><p>The day after New Year's Day we decided to go to the British Museum, to see the mummies.  So did half of London, it seemed.  I've never seen it so crowded.  Still, the mummies are always interesting.  I must go back another time and see some other sections.
<p>Home was via bookshop, Pizza Express, and <cite>Little Fockers</cite> at the cinema (ignore the critics: it&rsquo;s loadsa fun; unless you didn&rsquo;t like the first two, of course).</p>
<p>Oh, but before all that, we had tried to play basketball in Millfields Park.  But there was an annoying dog-owner who couldn&rsquo;t control her Alsatian.  The latter proceeded to bite our basketball till it burst.  When we remonstrated with the owner, she ran off.</p>
<p>At least it was only the basketball that got bitten.</p>
<p>The next day brought an early start.  Neither London&rsquo;s young skaters nor anybody else gets up very early on New Year&rsquo;s Bank Holiday Monday, it seems.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen London streets so empty.  The drive in to the Aldwych area for the start of skating at <a href="http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/">Somerset House</a> felt like driving through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Cornelius">Jerry Cornelius</a> novel: &ldquo;Martin tooled the big <strike><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.rpmgo.com/cars/d/4797-3/1935_duesenberg_sj.JPG&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.rpmgo.com/cars/main.php%3Fg2_view%3Dslideshow.Slideshow%26g2_itemId%3D4766&amp;usg=__M80BWONEN3ESa9u8It7K-8h8xl8=&amp;h=427&amp;w=640&amp;sz=60&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;sig2=CK79ZntbLssib-suI6Nugw&amp;zoom=1&amp;tbnid=9Ci3FGYeLjQKFM:&amp;tbnh=117&amp;tbnw=166&amp;ei=r7kjTaP4LI-DhQfF74S4Dg&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3DDuesenberg%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26sa%3DX%26rls%3Den%26biw%3D1004%26bih%3D536%26tbs%3Disch:1%26prmd%3Divns&amp;itbs=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=491&amp;oei=r7kjTaP4LI-DhQfF74S4Dg&amp;esq=1&amp;page=1&amp;ndsp=15&amp;ved=1t:429,r:9,s:0&amp;tx=71&amp;ty=62">Duesenberg</a></strike> Skoda down Roseberry Avenue&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t skate any more.  I did it twice when I was a student, and I think once since I had kids.  From the student times, I remember enjoying it, but getting very wet and very bruised.  With kids I didn&rsquo;t fall over so much, but only through caution, not because I had magically become able to skate.</p>
<p>Anyway, what with one thing and another, I didn&rsquo;t do it through all those intervening years, and by the time my kids were old enough to be interested and able, I had <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2004/06/11/post-election-injury-report/">broken my cruciate ligament</a> in a freak gardening accident.  I probably could do it now, but I&rsquo;m too scared of re-injuring my knee.</p>
<p>So I sat in the warmth of &ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s Skate Lounge&rdquo; and had a Cappuccino and a Danish, and took photographs and notes, while our party slowly, but with increasing confidence, circled the ice.  I loved the fact that the staff members who were on the ice had hi-viz vests saying &ldquo;Ice Marshall&rdquo;.  There&rsquo;s something very pleasing about that term.</p>
<p>After that we drove on out to South Kensington, and the <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/">Natural History Museum</a>.  Ostensibly to see the dinosaurs.  But of course, the other half of London had decided to do the same.  After queueing for maybe twenty minutes to get inside, we found a 45-minute queue for the dinosaurs.  So we elected for the blue whale, via the other mammals, instead.</p>
<p>Which was of course, fabulous.  Wonderful place, the Natural History Museum.  Actually, London&rsquo;s pretty wonderful.</p>

			 <html><body><p>On our recent drive south from the Highlands there was a song that briefly seemed to be following us.  First at an emergency food stop in a McDonald’s in Carlisle, and then the next day on XFM, as we rolled back into London.</p>
<p>Its key feature was the the refrain, which seemed to say, repeatedly: “You own a tank-top.”</p>
<p>While I can see the logic of outing someone for that particular crime against fashion, I was fairly sure it was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen">mondegreen</a>.</p>
<p>So when I was back at a computer, I searched for <strong>“you own a tank top” lyrics mondegreen</strong>.  No hits.</p>
<p>I removed the word “lyrics”, which gave me a single hit.  <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBkQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Firclogs.qmsk.net%2Fchannels%2Ftycoon%2Fdate%2F2010-02-16%3Fpage%3D2&amp;ei=TlnPTNPIOdH1sgbW2NjyAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHpjxwjwUMtxi0kOSDiWOABofT0qA&amp;sig2=HOIbnzQpPqd27ahT9aXJBA">Some IRC log</a>.  But it was enough.  The song is, apparently, ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5yQNpgeR8E">You Overdid it Doll</a>‘ by The Courteeners.</p>
<p>It’s kind of disappointing to know the truth.  I’m listening to it as I type, and I can’t hear it saying “you own a tank-top” any more.  Still, it has entered family lore, and will always be known that way to us.</p>
<p>In the interests of full disclosure, I should note that I once owned a tank-top.  In my defence, it was the seventies, and I was seven.<br>
<a href="http://petsoundsthemasterplan.wordpress.com/"><br>
Also, my nephew, Paul, who is travelling around Australia and other far-off places</a>, and blogging about it, once tried to introduce me to The Courteeners.  I wasn’t super-impressed, but I quite like this track.</p>
<p>On the same short drive Paul introduced me to <a href="http://www.vampireweekend.com/">Vampire Weekend</a>, who I love, and you should listen to.  And either way, you should read his <a href="http://petsoundsthemasterplan.wordpress.com/">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s not yet midnight as I type, and I&rsquo;ve just downloaded it.</li></p>
<li><p><a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> is about to start.  I'm having a go this year.  <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/658975">Wish me luck</a>.
<p>I last tried it in <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2004/12/07/writing-identity-and-voting/">2004</a>, which is much longer ago than I thought.  I sort of had a half-hearted poke at it last year, but soon stopped.  I&rsquo;m hoping that expressing my intention in public like this will help to keep me going.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see, of course.</p>
</p><p>I see that the approaching start has brought the NaNoWriMo site to its knees.  Oh well.  Hopefully they'll get things back together.</p></li>

			 <html><body><p>So, I've had this here new MacBook for a couple of weeks, and I've yet to post anything from it.  I am, not surprisingly, loving it.
<p>The initial weirdnesses (I&rsquo;ve never used a Mac before, apart from once very briefly, before OS/X) include the absence of a hash-key (though you can get the character using Alt+3: #); the plethora of modifier keys: Ctrl and Alt, of course, but also Cmd and Fn.  Though actually, most laptops have Fn, so it&rsquo;s really just one extra.  But they get a lot of use.</p>
<p>The nicest thing is probably the multitouch trackpad: scroll with two fingers, navigate with three, do some other weird navigation thing (Exposé, I think it&rsquo;s called) with four.  Pure dead brilliant, in the vernacular of my homeland.</p>
<p>Most annoying thing is the American positioning of the @ and &quot; keys.  I&rsquo;d like to remap those back to where my muscle-memory says they should be, but haven&rsquo;t worked out how to do that yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve installed various pieces of software on trial or demo options.  I&rsquo;m typing this entry using <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>.  I&rsquo;m gathering notes for the the thing I intend to write for <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> using <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html">Scrivener</a>.  And so on.</p>
<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s the beginning of a big adventure.</p>
<p>And now, let&rsquo;s see how this posts.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I've got out of the habit of writing about everything I read, but I've had such a good run of books over the summer that I want to at least make some notes on them all.
</p><h2><cite>Anathem</cite> by Neal Stephenson</h2>
<p>I tweeted as follows, while I was reading this:</p>
<!-- http://twitter.com/devilgate/status/20127684479 --> <style type="text/css">.bbpBox{background:url(http://s.twimg.com/a/1283555538/images/themes/theme5/bg.gif) #352726;padding:20px;}</style>
<div id="tweet_20127684479" class="bbpBox" style="background:url(http://s.twimg.com/a/1283555538/images/themes/theme5/bg.gif) #352726;padding:20px;"><p class="bbpTweet" style="background:#fff;padding:10px 12px 10px 12px;margin:0;min-height:48px;color:#000;font-size:16px !important;line-height:22px;-moz-border-radius:5px;-webkit-border-radius:5px;">I don't go in for having a 'favourite' book, but if I did, right now, it would be Neal Stephenson's _Anathem_. It made my brain sparkle.<span class="timestamp" style="font-size:12px;display:block;"><a title="Mon Aug 02 09:45:01 " href="http://twitter.com/devilgate/status/20127684479">Mon Aug 02 09:45:01 </a> via <a href="http://twitter.com/" rel="nofollow">Twitter for iPhone</a></span><span class="metadata" style="display:block;width:100%;clear:both;margin-top:8px;padding-top:12px;height:40px;border-top:1px solid #fff;border-top:1px solid #e6e6e6;"><span class="author" style="line-height:19px;"><a href="http://twitter.com/devilgate"><img src="http://a1.twimg.com/profile_images/53301097/Martin-shades-poster_normal.jpg" style="float:left;margin:0 7px 0 0px;width:38px;height:38px;"></a><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/devilgate">Martin McCallion</a></strong><br>devilgate</span></span></p></div>
<!-- end of tweet -->
<p>And making my brain sparkle is exactly the effect reading this had on me.  I absolutely loved every minute of it (except, perhaps, the long detour over the pole).  And the unusual thing about is this: it made me think, &ldquo;Come on, get the action out of the way, and get back to the talking and philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go in to any detail.  There are plenty of places you can <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAnathem&amp;ei=F7WGTP-FIpS24gbVxZHSBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXlIGBkRFCvrFr-IeMPAsptCHoOA&amp;sig2=891vnPdWHYksIPHQLSDFVw">read more about it</a>.  A wonderful, wonderful book.</p>
<h2><cite>The Time-Traveller's Wife</cite> by Audrey Niffenegger</h2>
<p>As is this one.  There has been a lot written about this, too.  I, of course, approached it with genre in mind, and was amused from the start by the review-quotes on the cover; notably The Observer&rsquo;s assertion that it is &ldquo;startlingly original&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about someone who randomly travels in time along their own timeline.   I kept thinking, &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five">Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.</a>&rdquo;.  I kept thinking, &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%94All_You_Zombies%E2%80%94">I know where I came from, but what about all you zombies?</a>&rdquo; (which quote I misremembered; it is actually &ldquo;<a href="http://ieng9.ucsd.edu/~mfedder/zombies.html">&hellip;but where did all you zombies come from?</a>&quot;)</p>
<p>I even thought, &ldquo;Spoilers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Song_%28Doctor_Who%29">Hello Sweetie.</a>&rdquo;, but a quick check of the publication date informs me that it actually pre-dates new <cite>Doctor Who</cite>, so maybe Moffat was influenced by this.</p>
<p>Anyway, all those touchpoints are largely irrelevant, as this is not a work of science fiction at all (it makes no attempt to explain the time-travel mechanism, though does assign it some genetic connection).  It is, rather, a love story with slightly unusual constraints.  And very well told, though I&rsquo;m a tad unhappy with the ending.</p>
<h2><cite>The Night Sessions</cite> by Ken MacLeod</h2>
<p>As I am with the ending of this one.  It&rsquo;s a fine story, though, set in a future Edinburgh where global warming has been partially turned back by technology, and there are space elevators and fully-conscious robots and other AIs.  It&rsquo;s a crime story, with the main character being a cop.</p>
<p>Edinburgh&rsquo;s SF writers seem to be trying to get a bit of Iain Rankine&rsquo;s territory these days.</p>
<h2><cite>The Clan Corporate</cite> by Charles Stross</h2>
<p>Charlie being the other of those I&rsquo;m alluding to there.  Here, though, we&rsquo;re back in his &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross#Merchant_Princes_series">Merchant Princes</a> series.  I&rsquo;ve reviewed the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2007/04/12/book-notes-25-the-family-trade-by-charles-stross/">first</a> and <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/03/16/the-hidden-family-by-charles-stross-books-2008-2/">second</a> volumes before.</p>
<p>I said before that it was hard to believe how successful Miriam Beckstein is, given the radical changes that have happened to her.  In this one she is much more circumscribed, by her odd family.</p>
<p>Relatively little happens here, really, but a lot is set in place for the following volumes.  The main thing is that her worlds are starting to collide.</p>
<h2><cite>Pandaemonium</cite> by Christopher Brookmyre</h2>
<p>Worlds colliding here, too.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read a Brookmyre since his first, <cite>Quite Ugly One Morning</cite>, which I remember thoroughly enjoying.  Not enough, though, to read any intervening ones.</p>
<p>This one is very different.  It has soldiers, scientists, priests, demons, and schoolkids.  It&rsquo;s great fun.</p>
<p>There is a wildly-glaring plot hole at the end.  My son read the book after me, and it was the first thing he said to me about it when he&rsquo;d finished.  We both hope it&rsquo;s deliberate, meaning that Brookmyre has a sequel planned.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Most, but not all of them at one event.
<h3 id="jamaica-and-senegal-make-music">Jamaica and Senegal Make Music</h3>
<p>A couple of weeks ago we went to the Barbican to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youssou_N%27Dour">Youssou N&rsquo;Dour</a>.  In support were an acoustic reggae band called <a href="http://www.makasound.com/ms_boutique.php?id_famille=2&amp;id_rubrique=45">Inna da Yard</a>.  They were fabulous fun, and reminded me that I&rsquo;ve been missing out on reggae since John Peel died.</p>
<p>Youssou and his band were amazing.  They had more percussionists on stage than most bands have members (five, counting the drummer), which amused me.</p>
<p>The total number of musicians on stage was about sixteen.  Plus they had a couple of amazing dancers.</p>
<p>And the professionals weren&rsquo;t the only ones dancing on the stage.  Several times members of the audience got up and joined in.  Yes, a veritable stage invasion in the Barbican.  The security people looked vaguely worried; I didn&rsquo;t know the Barbican even <em>had</em> security.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t try to <a href="http://www.paclink.com/~ascott/they/tamildaa.htm">dance about architecture</a> and describe the music, but let&rsquo;s just say it was the rockingest gig I&rsquo;ve been to at that venue.</p>
<h3 id="the-glass-eye">The Glass Eye</h3>
<p>A few days later it was off to the Hackney Empire, where we saw the original 1931 <cite>Dracula</cite>, with a live soundtrack.  Which was composed by <a href="http://www.philipglass.com/">Philip Glass</a>, and performed by him, Michael Riesman, and <a href="http://www.kronosquartet.org/">The Kronos Quartet</a>.  That&rsquo;s a pretty stellar lineup from the modern classical world.</p>
<p>I had at first thought that the film was silent, but it isn&rsquo;t (I think I was confusing it with <cite>Nosferatu</cite>).  Apparently it didn&rsquo;t originally have a musical soundtrack, though.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s clear that the film is the origin (or <em>an</em> origin) of many horror film clichés, and the story is of course very familiar, I don&rsquo;t think I had ever seen it before &ndash; though I thought I had.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing, though the film volume could have done with being louder, as the music drowned out the dialogue at times.  And on a related note, I&rsquo;m not convinced that the music was always only there to serve the film, as a true soundtrack should be.</p>
<p>But all in all a fascinating night.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I spelled Raoul Moat's name wrongly in my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2010/07/15/who-lays-flowers-for-a-murderer/">last post</a>.  Now corrected.
<p>I have to say that my sympathy for Moat was increased by reading an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jul/17/raoul-moat-brother-angus-moat">interview with his brother</a> in The Guardian.  A sad family story, there&rsquo;s no doubt.  But even Angus, the brother, condemns the Facebook page (which has now been removed by its creator).</p>
<p>Sympathy, yes; but he&rsquo;s still not a hero, or a &ldquo;legend&rdquo;.  Charlie Brooker <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jul/19/charlie-brooker-offensive-facebook-groups">talks sense</a> on the matter, as you might expect.</p></body></html></p>

<p>I was thinking about the literal, physical flowers that some misguided people had laid on the river bank where Raoul Moat died. Misguided, or possibly, grieving family members. Just because someone is a murderer, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that no-one grieves for their death.</p>
<p>But now, it seems, things have gone beyond that. Facebook tribute pages celebrating Moat&rsquo;s life, and especially his last few days in hiding from the police.</p>
<p>Go on the run, camp out for a bit, become a kind of hero: all very well (though I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;d recommend it as a career path) if the  crime were minor, or victimless.</p>
<p>But this guy murdered a man, and shot two other people. One of them has been left blind. The other is still in hospital.</p>
<p>This guy wasn&rsquo;t some Robin Hood figure. He was in no way a good guy. He was a grade &lsquo;A&rsquo; bampot, a fuckpig of the first water. And I&rsquo;m disgusted that anyone could think of celebrating his acts.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><h3>Betrayed?</h3>
<p>My initial reaction to the Liberal Democrats' decision to form a coalition with the Tories was a combination of disappointment and a sense of betrayal (with a side order of impending doom, of course).</p>
<p>I was, perhaps, naive.  <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2010/05/05/disappointment/">I said</a> that I was voting LibDem, and that I actively wanted Labour to lose (while stressing that I wanted the Tories to lose even more).  I was, I think, hoping for a hung parliament, which of course is what we got.  But I was labouring (heh!) under the delusion that the LibDems were ideologically relatively close to Labour, and far enough away from the Tories that siding with them would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>Clearly I was wrong.</p>
<p>I had convinced myself that the only reaction of the LibDems to a hung parliament would be to join with Labour; and that seemed like the best possible solution.</p>
<h3>Wasted?</h3>
<p>On election day my friend <a href="http://tonykeen.blogspot.com/">Tony</a> Facebooked to the effect that he had wasted his vote (and it&rsquo;s really annoying that, as far as I know, there&rsquo;s no way to link to an update or a comment in Facebook).  I answered:</p>
<blockquote>
  I don't agree. The only way you can waste a vote is to not
  use it. For example I voted LibDem in a safe Labour seat,
  but that isn't "wasted". In fact, it would have been more of
  a waste to vote Labour.
</blockquote>
<p>My son made the same point when I told him about that discussion.  Diane Abbott got 54% of the vote in Hackney North and Stoke Newington.  (That&rsquo;s a proper majority.)  My vote wouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference, though, would it?</p>
<p>But in the days immediately after the election, as Clegg took his party into talks with the hated Tories, I began to regret my decision.  It really felt like I had &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; my vote; or maybe misused is the better word.</p>
<h3>Things Can Maybe Get Better?</h3>
<p>However the <a href="http://www.libdems.org.uk/latest_news_detail.aspx?title=Conservative_Liberal_Democrat_coalition_agreements&amp;pPK=2697bcdc-7483-47a7-a517-7778979458ff">coalition document</a> that they published today is remarkable.  If you&rsquo;ve read any of my political posts over the years, you&rsquo;ll know that the biggest thing going on for me for some time has been ID cards, and all the associated post-9/11 terror-panic fallout.  So to read this, from the wordprocessor of the Tories (and LibDems) is remarkable:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Freedom or Great Repeal Bill.</li>
<li><p>The scrapping of ID card scheme, the National Identity register, the next generation of biometric passports and the Contact Point Database.</p></li>
<li><p>Outlawing the fingerprinting of children at school without parental permission.</p></li>
<li><p>The extension of the scope of the Freedom of Information Act to provide greater transparency.</p></li>
<li><p>Adopting the protections of the Scottish model for the DNA database.</p></li>
<li><p>The protection of historic freedoms through the defence of trial by jury.</p></li>
<li><p>The restoration of rights to non-violent protest.</p></li>
<li><p>The review of libel laws to protect freedom of speech.</p></li>
<li><p>Safeguards against the misuse of anti-terrorism legislation.</p></li>
<li><p>Further regulation of CCTV.</p></li>
<li><p>Ending of storage of internet and email records without good reason.</p></li>
<li><p>A new mechanism to prevent the proliferation of unnecessary new criminal offences.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, that's pretty much everything we could want on civil liberties, right there.
<p>And a few other points are good.  As my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/soapyfrogs">Stuart</a> said:</p>

<p>(Gotta keep  embedding those tweets, you know.)</p>
<h3>Dismal Science?</h3>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;m no economist; but as <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2010/05/05/disappointment/">I said before</a>, I don&rsquo;t trust right-wingers to run the economy.  And right now, I have a gut feeling that cutting back on public spending during a recession is exactly the wrong thing to do (cutting back on most public spending is nearly always the wrong thing to do, of course).</p>
<h3>Keep On Keeping On</h3>
<p>In conclusion, <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/05/meet-the-new-boss-same-as-the.html">I agree with Charlie</a>, pretty much.  I don&rsquo;t trust the Tories, but let&rsquo;s see whether Clegg &amp; co can keep this thing on track.  And let&rsquo;s keep a close eye on them all, and keep that list above in mind.</p>
<p>You never know: maybe this really is &ldquo;The New Politics&rdquo;.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><h3>The Boundaries of Voting</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been boundary-changed, and it&rsquo;s made it harder to decide who to vote for.</p>
<p>At the last election (and until a couple of weeks ago) We were in Hackney South and Shoreditch, which was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meg_Hillier">Meg Hillier&rsquo;s</a> constituency.  Meg wasn&rsquo;t a bad constituency MP, at least inasmuch as she answered my emails the few times I got in touch with her.  Not always in ways I agreed with, but still.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;ID Meg&rdquo;, as I liked to think of her, was the government minister for ID Cards and the Database state; the biggest issue at all recent elections for me.  Amusing, really, that she got into that role, if you consider <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2005/04/27/things-can-only-get-different/">my correspondence with her in 2005</a></p>
<p>If we had lived on the other side of our street back then, we&rsquo;d have been in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Abbott">Diane Abbott&rsquo;s</a> constituency.  She was opposed to the war, and to ID cards.  Plus I like her on the telly (though some, apparently, complain about her second job; at least it&rsquo;s a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/this_week/default.stm">political programme</a> she&rsquo;s on, even if it&rsquo;s lightweight to the point of triviality).</p>
<p>Five years ago I&rsquo;d have voted for Diane.  Today, with the boundary change, we&rsquo;re in Hackney North and Stoke Newington, so I can.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all gone too far.  Our electoral system is too fucked up; our Labour party is too fucked up, too corrupt.  They have developed an alarming reflexive response, it seems, to always do exactly the wrong thing.  A hung parliament &ndash; or, hey: a Liberal Democrat majority &ndash; might be just the change we need.</p>
<p>At least that way there&rsquo;s a chance we&rsquo;d get some taste of electoral reform.</p>
<h3>Houses.  Plagues.  You Know the Rest.</h3>
<p>Diane&rsquo;s leaflet came through the door today, and it tells me that she&rsquo;s still against ID cards and the Iraq war.  Why, then, I have to ask, does she still retain the Labour whip?  It would be more honourable to resign.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t honourably vote for the former Labour party any more (not that I did <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2005/05/06/the-afternoon-after-the-morning-after-the-night-before/">last time</a>, but remember, I was actively against the candidate then, too).  We&rsquo;ve come a long way now: we&rsquo;ve reached the stage where I <em>want</em> Labour to lose.  It&rsquo;s a strange place to find myself.</p>
<p>Maybe, I&rsquo;ve always been more of a natural LibDem voter anyway.  Any time I&rsquo;ve done those &ldquo;Political Compass&rdquo;-type questionnaires, they tell me that the LibDems most closely match my answers.</p>
<p>But even more than wanting Labour to lose, I want the <em>Tories</em> to lose.  I remain profoundly mistrustful of them; I lived through the Thatcher years, you know?  And It&rsquo;s clear that, no matter how shiny Cameron may be, lots of his members remain the same old bastards.  Witness this &ldquo;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8660214.stm">I cure gays</a>&rdquo; bollocks from Phlippa Stroud.  And Cameron has now backed her, I see.  And she has <a href="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/goldlist/2010/05/the-observers-attack-on-philippa-stroud.html">denied it</a>.</p>
<p>So much for that.  We know the Tories are the opposite of socially liberal; we know they take a reflexive antagonism to supporting public services; and we know we can&rsquo;t trust them with the economy (you never can trust right wingers, because they believe the market is guided by an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand">invisible hand</a>; I mean, come <em>on</em>).</p>
<h3>I Can't Do Both, Gordie</h3>
<p>So now Brown is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/may/05/gordon-brown-manchester-labour-poll-boost">saying</a>, &lsquo;Vote for the kind of country you believe in; and come home to Labour.&rsquo;  Sorry, mon: Labour no longer represents the kind of country I believe in.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keithangus.com/index.php">Keith Angus</a> will be getting my vote.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I don't get round to these things quickly, but this is, at least in part, a report on my family's visit to Eastercon.  This year the British National Science Fiction Convention was practically on our doorstep, just the other side of London, at Heathrow.
<p>As with <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/04/03/that-reporting-back-from-eastercon-business/" title="Eastercon 2008">two years ago</a>, my son wanted to come.  And since my daughter did as well, my beloved bit the bullet and came along too.  SF isn&rsquo;t totally her thing, but I think she may have enjoyed the weekend more than any of us.</p>
<p>The telling detail was this: there are lots of things to do.</p>
<p>I tend to use cons as a way of seeing friends that I haven&rsquo;t seen for a while &ndash; often not since the last con I was at.  So I mainly hang out in the bar.  Or that, at least, is the impression I gave &ndash; give &ndash; to people who don&rsquo;t go to cons.</p>
<p>In fact, I have always gone to programme items.  I guess I just never made a big thing of them when I got home.</p>
<p>This con &ndash; <a href="http://www.odyssey2010.org/">Odyssey 2010</a> &ndash; had a particularly good set of programme items for kids.  There were hands-on science workshops, making Dalek cakes, and building string-propelled robots (my son won a prize for the best ramp-mounting attempt).  And not least, a thrilling battle between various knights of the <a href="http://www.sca.org/">Society for Creative Anachronism</a> (SCA).</p>
<p>The programme was full of fascinating and fun things, many of which I wanted to see, but didn&rsquo;t manage to, as ever.</p>
<p>And of course, I saw a lot of old friends, and had a good time hanging out in the bar with them.</p>
<p>We only stayed for the Friday and Saturday nights, to keep costs down.  But after going home on the Sunday (and watching the new <cite>Doctor Who</cite> again), we went back on the Monday, and spent most of the day back at the <a href="http://www.radissonedwardian.com/londonuk_heathrow" title="The Eastercon 2010 Hotel">Radisson</a> <a href="http://www.radissonedwardian.com/londonuk_heathrow" title="The Eastercon 2010 Hotel">Radisson</a>.</p>
<p>Travelling all across London was a bit of drag, but it was a lot shorter than many people&rsquo;s journeys.  And of course, there was absolutely no chance of [ash-induced delays] <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/europe/2010/iceland_volcano/default.stm">volcano</a>.</p>
<p>Am I a bad person because I found all the volcanic disruption kind of amusing and quite fun, really?  The cloudless and contrail-free blue skies over London were gorgeous, and it was interesting to follow people&rsquo;s tweets of how they were striving to get home.  And a world with a lot fewer flights is something we&rsquo;re probably going to have to face in the future.</p>
<p>What annoyed me about it all were the idiots who blamed the government.  Marginally more sensible than blaming &lsquo;god&rsquo;, I suppose<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but even if anything other than sending in the Navy had been the government&rsquo;s decision, can you imagine the fuss if flights had been allowed to go ahead, and there <em>had</em> been a disaster?</p>
<p>Plus, the idea of getting a trip home on the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Ark_Royal" title="Not the original one, though">Ark Royal</a></em> is pretty cool.</p>
<hr>
</p><ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>As somebody said, if that's an act of god, then it's a pretty limited kind of omnipotent deity.

			 <html><body><p>Easter rolls around on its mad-god-inspired schedule, and so too does <a href="http://www.eastercon.org/index.php/Main_Page">Eastercon</a>, the British National Science-Fiction Convention.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.odyssey2010.org/">This year</a>, as it was <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/04/03/that-reporting-back-from-eastercon-business/">two years ago</a>, it’s in the Radisson Edwardian Hotel, near Heathrow.  Not the most pleasant or interesting of locations, but it does have the large advantage for me of being relatively close to home.  An hour and forty minutes by bus and tube, if <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/" title="Transport for London">TFL</a> is to be believed.  And curiously, not much less time overall if you take the crazily-expensive Heathrow Express.</p>
<p>Anyway, the whole family are coming with me this time, which should be fun. We’re just staying for the Saturday and Sunday nights, though some of us may pop back on Monday.</p>
<p>I don’t have any particular plans to see anything on the programme, except the big ones: Iain Banks’s guest of honour speech, and <cite>Doctor Who</cite>.  Looking forward to that one a lot.  And it’s going to be interesting watching it with a few hundred other people.</p>
<p>Speaking of guests of honour, the other one is Alastair Reynolds, and i’ve never read any of his stuff (well, maybe a short story or two).  So I thought I should do some homework.  I’ve been meaning to check him out for a while anyway.</p>
<p>I’ve started <cite>Revelation Space</cite>, but I’m having a hard time getting into it.  It’s just a bit slow to get going.  I hope it’ll pick up soon.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>On Monday I took my son to the Barbican to see <a href="http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/">The Magnetic Fields</a>.  It was his first proper gig.  And an experience quite unlike most gigs I've been to before.
<p>For a start it was entirely seated, and I&rsquo;ve not been to one of those in a long time - and not just the audience, the band too.  Secondly, it was in <a href="http://www.barbican.org.uk/">the Barbican Centre</a>.  We&rsquo;ve been there a few times in the last few months for classical concerts and a dance performance, but it&rsquo;s a strange venue for rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll.</p>
<p>But then, rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll isn&rsquo;t exactly what The Magnetic Fields play.</p>
<p>Their <cite>69 Love Songs</cite> is, <a href="http://twitter.com/devilgate/status/9632822832">as I was tweeting recently</a>, one of the finest albums ever.  It&rsquo;s from 1999, it turns out, but I&rsquo;ve only known it for a year or two.  The first half of Monday&rsquo;s show contained a good number of songs from it, and also some from the recent <cite>Distortion</cite>.</p>
<p>The highlight for my boy wasn&rsquo;t even a Magnetic Fields song at all, but rather one by <a href="http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/gothicarchies.php">The Gothic Archies</a>, one of their several alter egos.  It also featured the only instance in the evening of singing along with the band; and that was just him, quietly singing &lsquo;Shipwrecked&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We were right up at the back of the balcony, but despite the distance and low volume, we could still hear everything perfectly.  Well, except when they spoke between songs.  The vocal mix wasn&rsquo;t really designed for making that kind of thing audible at the back.</p>
<p>In fact Merritt&rsquo;s vocals were at their best during the final song, when he took the mike off the stand and walked about.  That got him closer to the mike, which suits his croonerish voice.</p>
<p>So they sent us off into the night with a fabulous &lsquo;Papa was a Rodeo&rsquo;.</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Last night I finished <cite>Living Next-Door to the God of Love</cite>, by Justina Robson.  I enjoyed much of it, but found it kind of frustrating and annoying, in ways that were hard to define.  The main one, though, was that some things were insufficiently explained.
<p>Now, as SF readers we are used to jumping into new worlds, not quite knowing what&rsquo;s going on, and picking it up as we go along.  Indeed, that&rsquo;s part of the <a href="http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=blog&amp;id=58637">toolkit for reading it (SF reading protocols at Tor.com)</a>.</p>
<p>But here, there was something just not quite right, I felt.  It was as if there was too much understanding assumed.  Had the writer spent too long with her world, I wondered?  So long that she could no longer tell what the reader would and wouldn&rsquo;t know, since she knew it so intimately?</p>
<p>When I finished it I went looking for reviews, to see whether others had the same feeling as me.  And what I found proved that, in a sense, I was right about her assuming too much knowledge.</p>
<p>It turns out the book is a <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2006/04/living_ne.shtml">sequel</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yes.  It&rsquo;s the sequel to her previous book, <cite>Natural History</cite>.</p>
<p>Which is fine.  But nowhere on the book itself does it tell you that.  Nowhere.  I&rsquo;ve checked again and again: it&rsquo;s not in the blurb, it&rsquo;s not on the title page, it&rsquo;s not in the front matter.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I would have liked to have known this little detail before I started reading.  Sure, you <em>can</em> pick things up as you go along; and now that I know it, I realise that she gave us the necessary backstory very well.  But really, Pan MacMillan: next time, let us know, OK?</p></body></html></p>

A fitting conclusion, I suppose, as the start of it was similarly low-key (I had a small kid at the time, and have two much bigger ones now); and I've spent much of the decade with a computer close at hand.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>The new Iain Banks book, <cite>Transition</cite>, is a science fiction novel. This is despite the fact that it is not published as by Iain <em>M</em> Banks.
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean the slightly-ambiguous, could-be-a-dream-or-somebody&rsquo;s-madness-if-you-don&rsquo;t-want-to-suspend-your-disbelief sort of thing you get in <cite>The Bridge</cite> Or <cite>Walking On Glass</cite>, either.  This is out-and-out SF, no  queries or discussion.  It is a tale of parallel universes, of an infinity of alternative Earths, and of people who can move between them, using a combination of drugs and native ability.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that ability that holds both one of the novel&rsquo;s unanswered moral questions, and its biggest flaw.</p>
<p>When adepts transition between the worlds, they do so in mind only.  That is, their mind occupies - possesses - the body of someone who already exists on the target parallel.</p>
<p>Ethically, this is a minefield, of course.  But that question is only vaguely touched on.</p>
<p>Other ethical issues are addressed, notably the use of torture by states.  There is passing character - just a walk-on, really - of a policeman who once tortured a terrorist suspect and had some success.  He was tortured in turn by his guilt for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>The big flaw, though, concerns the transition mechanism and its use, and to talk about it, I&rsquo;ll have to include some minor spoilers.  So, you know: you have been warned.</p>
<p>As I said, flitting between the parallel universes involves the mind, the personality of the transitionary jumping into the body of someone already existing on the target parallel.  This applies even when someone takes a &lsquo;passenger&rsquo; along, which some can do.  Each of them takes over a body in the new world.</p>
<p>But sometimes Banks has characters jumping to places where there really <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> be a body for them to take over (versions of the Earth that are uninhabited, for example).  Yet they seem to jump successfully.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind there being a &lsquo;bodiless&rsquo; and a &lsquo;bodiful&rsquo; version of the ability, for example: but it does need to be explained, or at least mentioned.  I can hardly believe that nobody picked this up in the revision and editing process.</p>
<p>That aside, though, it&rsquo;s damn fine, and probably his best &lsquo;non-M&rsquo; for quite a few years.</p>
<p>With the secret cabal that is trying to run the world(s) behind the scenes, it is sort of <cite>The Business 2.0</cite>.  Or maybe 10.0.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>If you had asked me a few months ago whether I had read this I'd have said yes.  I thought that I had read most, if not all, of Wilson's books that are in linked to the <cite>Illuminatus</cite> trilogy.  But I'd have been wrong.
<p>This one features James Joyce and Albert Einstein drinking in a bar in Zurich in 19??.  They meet one Sir John Babcock, who has been studying magick (though from a Christian perspective) under the guidance of the Society of the Rose Cross, or Rosicrucians.</p>
<p>Maybe.  Unless it&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>Stuff happens.  Magic and monsters ensue, or people are made to believe that they do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the best or most momentous of his works, but he makes the characters of Einstein and Joyce surprisingly compelling, and Babcock is an affecting innocent abroad, and it all keeps you reading.  Good stuff.</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Above all, this took me a <em>loooong</em> time to finish.  Even when I was reading it steadily and thought I would just carry straight on through, it was slow going.
<p>It&rsquo;s not that hated it; or even that I didn&rsquo;t like it.  Nor, indeed. was the prose hard or complex.  It just didn&rsquo;t grab me; didn&rsquo;t interest me that much.  I didn&rsquo;t, in the end, care that much about the characters or what happened to them.  The character, really, since it&rsquo;s mainly about the journalist and poet Ka.</p>
<p>In part, I think that&rsquo;s because of the overall structure, and one or two narrative devices.  It&rsquo;s a third-person limited-omniscient narrative, focalised on Ka.  Except it&rsquo;s not: there&rsquo;s a first-person narrator, a novelist called Pamuk, who is Ka&rsquo;s friend, and is telling his story.  He only appears directly in the novel twice, though.</p>
<p>So it starts out as Ka&rsquo;s story, and eventually becomes a fragment of &lsquo;Pamuk&rsquo;s&rsquo;.  Along the way, though, while we are in the middle of the story of Ka&rsquo;s few days in the Turkish border town of Kars, the end of his story is spoiled for us.  It is literally <em>spoilered</em>, with a chapter in which is four years later, and &lsquo;Pamuk&rsquo; is in Frankfurt, going through Ka&rsquo;s things after the latter has been murdered.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also told he doesn&rsquo;t get the girl.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s back to the main story.  And you expect me to <em>care</em>?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure you can call it a novel of character, for there, isn&rsquo;t the character supposed to grow, develop, learn something?  He certainly goes through various experiences, and probably does change; but I&rsquo;m not sure that we can tell whether he has developed or grown, not least because we are robbed of any final scene with him, of anything on how he leaves Kars, of anything on his life afterwards.  All that is only told to us as if second-hand, and in a very fragmentary, incomplete and unreliable form.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partly a novel about Turkey, of course, about its stresses: the &lsquo;headscarf girls&rsquo;, who want to wear the Islamic garment to college, where it is banned; the epidemic of suicides of girls and young women which plagues Kars; the tension between the urges to democratic, religious and military rule.  I certainly know more about (one person&rsquo;s vision of) contemporary Turkey now than I did before I started.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t help but wonder: what was the point of it, really?  Plot, character, great prose: two of them can sustain a novel; even any one of them, if it&rsquo;s good enough.  But this didn&rsquo;t really have much of any of them.</p>
<p>Yet this guy has won the Nobel Prize for Literature, so he must be doing something right.</p>
<p>I just wish I knew what.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>This has been the third year in which I have read a volume of <cite>The Baroque Cycle</cite> over the summer.  <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2007/01/21/book-notes-23-quicksilver-by-neal-stephenson/">I loved the first</a>, despite its dip after the first book.  <a href="/pages/books-2007/the-confusion-by-neal-stephenson-books-2007-16/">The second was slower</a> - in fact suffering from classic middle-volume <em>longeurs</em>.  I thoroughly enjoyed them both, though.
<p>This third volume is the best of the three.  I enjoyed it so much that, towards the end (that is, in the last two-hundred-or-so pages) I found myself sometimes avoiding reading it, because I didn&rsquo;t want it to be over.</p>
<p>The focus is very much back with Daniel Waterhouse, where it started, which is good from my point of view.  Jack Shaftoe and Eliza (Duchess of the preposterously named Qwghlm) are in there too, of course.</p>
<p>And, it&rsquo;s too damn <em>long</em> for me to write much more about it.  If you&rsquo;ve read the first two, you will, of course, want to read this.  If you haven&rsquo;t read any of them, you should.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Cayce Pollard has a strange kind of allergy: certain brands make her ill.
<p>Or at least, their logos do; seeing the Michelin Man, for instance, sets her off in a particularly bad way. She has a corresponding - and possibly linked - talent, which is that she can reliably tell whether a new logo, for example, is going to work; and she can spot trends that are developing on the street. Using these abilities she is able to make a pretty good living by acting as a freelance consultant to marketing people, advertisers, and so on.</p>
<p>It sounds like a pretty shallow kind of life, but she&rsquo;s an engaging character, and Gibson manages both to make her role seem interesting, and to enmesh her in an international plot that keeps the pages turning.</p>
<p>The main weakness, perhaps, is that you never get the sense that she&rsquo;s in any real danger. And the mysteries that she ends up investigating find their solutions too easily.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Gibson has written anything really startling since his debut, but this is a fun enough read.</p>
<p>I always tend to touch on genre here, but I make no apologies for it. The odd thing here is that, while is clearly <em>not</em> SF in terms of setting and content (it&rsquo;s the very near future of the time it was written, which makes it our very near past, and has some already-surprising spots that feel like anachronisms, but aren&rsquo;t: like connecting a new laptop to a new phone by wire, rather than Bluetooth; and the only speculative content is Cayce&rsquo;s curious affliction/ability), it still <em>feels</em> like SF. And I&rsquo;m not sure entirely why that is. Gibson&rsquo;s style is no doubt part of it, and the rest must be theme: it does, after all, address the way the world is changing, and the effect those changes are having on the people that live through them.</p>
<p>The curious thing, really, is that such themes should trigger an <em>SF</em> response in the reader (or writer) What does it say about &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; literature if that genre <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> address the world today?</p>

			 <html><body><p>Mr Handler operating under his own name, here, rather than his <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/08/26/a-series-of-unfortunate-events-by-lemony-snicket-books-2008-10/">Snicket</a> <em>nom de plume</em>.  As such, this is a novel for adults, rather than children.
<p>Though in fact, is it even a novel at all?  It is in fact more of series of short stories, or even vignettes.  They are linked, or at least related to each other, but it&rsquo;s not always obvious how.</p>
<p>The same characters recur throughout, though in different combinations.  Or at least, the same character <em>names</em>.  It&rsquo;s not at all clear that, where a name recurs, it is meant to be the same person.  Indeed, the author says as much in his blurb.</p>
<p>The main link between them all is that they are all in some way or another about love.  In fact, a better title might be something like, &lsquo;A Series of Tales About Love&rsquo;, or even, &lsquo;A Series of Loving Events&rsquo;.  The title comes from Handler&rsquo;s assertion that, essentially, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what we do, it&rsquo;s how we do it&rdquo;, and the fact that each of the stories (or chapters) has an adverbal title: &lsquo;Particularly&rsquo;, &lsquo;Briefly&rsquo;, &lsquo;Not Particularly&rsquo;, and so on.</p>
<p>It all gets a bit meta in the middle, where Handler breaks the fourth wall and addresses the reader directly.</p>
<p>And it has a soundtrack album, in two senses: throughout the book, there are references to bands and songs, so you could construct a suitable playlist from that.  But given Handler&rsquo;s alternative career as a musician and member of <a href="http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/">The Magnetic Fields</a>, the album to play while reading it is undoubtedly their <cite>69 Love Songs</cite>.  You&rsquo;ll find many themes in common and overlap between book and album.</p>
<p>All in all it&rsquo;s thoroughly enjoyable, but doesn&rsquo;t really go anywhere - it doesn&rsquo;t have a plot, after all - and is kind of inconclusive.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I came upon these when I was digging out some old comics for my son.  These are <em>not</em> for eleven-year-olds, but I realised I hadn't read them in years, and I thought I'd see how they had aged (plus, I remembered next to nothing about the story).
<p>The story is not bad, but not that great.  In a post-collapse America, corruption and gang violence are rife, and the government (perhaps all the governments of the world) have left Earth, and are still ruling (or trying to) from Mars.  On Earth the law - and to some extent, the peace - is kept by the Plexus Rangers.  Or rather, as you eventually realise, the PlexUS Rangers, since there are also PlexUSSR Rangers.  The Plex is the overall world government.  Or something.</p>
<p>Reuben Flagg was a video star (ie TV or movie: there&rsquo;s a lot about &lsquo;video&rsquo; here, but it&rsquo;s pretty much all broadcast stuff) on Mars.  He played the eponymous &lsquo;Mark Thrust, Sexus Ranger&rsquo;.  But new technology has made actors unnecessary, and he has volunteered as a Plexus Ranger and been sent to Earth, to Chicago.</p>
<p>He is the one (relatively) good man in a corrupt environment, and with the help of a clumsy android, a talking cat, and various women in their underwear, he tries to keep things under control.</p>
<p>Oh yes, the underwear thing: Chaykin is unable, it seems to draw women wearing anything other than basques, stockings and suspenders.  No matter what they&rsquo;re doing, pretty much.  There&rsquo;s nothing like wearing your fetishes on your sleeve, I suppose.  Or, you know, lower down.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Posted out of sequence, for reasons unknown even to me.
<p>Writing about this novel is kind of embarassing for me, because I had the chance to make it better than it is, and I, er, blew it because I read too slowly.</p>
<p>See, I was on quite a large list of people who saw a draft version of this, a year or two ago.  I read most of it (or all of it, but it was incomplete, I can&rsquo;t quite remember) and noted some mistakes and flaws.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t get them all recorded properly and submitted to Charlie before the deadline.  And now, when I read the published version, I find they&rsquo;re all still there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing  dramatic, nothing plot-shattering (although there are one or two places where things could be clearer, and where the cracks aren&rsquo;t fully papered over: you can see where a section has been moved for dramatic purposes, but the knowledge of the protagonists hasn&rsquo;t been adjusted to mark the events' new location in the overall plot, for example).  It&rsquo;s mainly just niggles, misuses of terminology (school years called &lsquo;primary third&rsquo;, and &lsquo;secondary two&rsquo;, instead of &lsquo;primary three&rsquo; and &lsquo;second year&rsquo;, respectively, for example).  So, just some minor distractions.  And the spelling of &lsquo;dreich&rsquo; as &lsquo;dreicht&rsquo; throughout is curious.</p>
<p>But no matter.  Much more interesting are the questions of how well the multiple-viewpoint second person narration works; and is the story any good?</p>
<p>On the first point, I had no trouble with the second-person narrative at all, and it being multiple-person is effectively no different from any other book that does that.  There is rarely any confusion, not least because each chapter includes the VP character&rsquo;s name as part of its title.</p>
<p>The story is interesting, and it investigates an area - that of security in our increasingly-networked world - that is very important, and will only get more so in the near future.  But I&rsquo;m not, in all honesty, sure that it really works.  The various parts don&rsquo;t quite gel.</p>
<p>And yet, I enjoyed reading it.  I enjoyed being on the trip, I just look back at it and think, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that great.&quot;</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Hmmm, once again I try a Warren Ellis, and find that it's not as good as I expected, or hoped.  'Good', that is, in the sense of 'exciting, dramatic, interesting'.  I didn't dislike it, and the story was OK; but it never really caught fire, you know?
<p>Still, it was his debut, so maybe the thing is to try some of his later work (I should also add that, at the time of publishing, if not the time of reading or writing, I am regularly reading and enjoying <a href="http://freakangels.com/">FreakAngels</a>).</p>
<p>I should probably mention the artwork, not least since I met the artist at Eastercon.  It&rsquo;s similar, actually, in that, while it&rsquo;s perfectly fine, I kind of hoped it would be better.  I couldn&rsquo;t say that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with it: you can always tell what&rsquo;s going on, for example.  I think maybe it&rsquo;s that the style is a bit too cartoonish for the material.</p>
<p>The eponymous Lazarus is four hundred years old, and as far as he knows, immortal and indestructible, by virtue of some large percentage of his body having been replaced with smart plastics.  He&rsquo;s the only one in this condition, though, and he&rsquo;s not happy about it.  The main driver of the plot is his desire to die; or at least, we are led to understand that this will be the main driver.  In fact it&rsquo;s not, and each episode within the overall work has its own antagonism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of extreme violence and brutality, some interesting ideas, but it&rsquo;s sadly unmemorable.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I bought this in a second-hand bookshop, and tucked into the back there was a cutting from <cite>The Guardian</cite> of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/nov/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview22">this review</a> by Michael Moorcock.  So go and look there if you want a plot summary: he does it much better then I could.
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting, dark story, and I&rsquo;m not totally sure how I feel about it.  It straddles the SF/fantasy divide, at least in the sense that it is set in the far future, there are hints of spaceflight being common, and there is much genetic and somatic manipulation; but there are also talking animals.</p>
<p>Of course, the talking animals (mainly meerkats) are enabled by the genetic engineering, so really it&rsquo;s unabashedly SF.  However, Shadrach&rsquo;s descent into the literal underworld of the levels below the city are straight out of mythology.  And the description of the organ bank, while striking, are just fanciful to the point of unbelievability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first thing I&rsquo;ve read by Vandermeer, and while I enjoyed it, it doesn&rsquo;t immediately make me want to go out and read more.  That said, his <cite>City of Saints and Madmen</cite> does attract me, if only because it&rsquo;s such a great title.  I keep hearing (well, reading) people referring to him recently, so I don&rsquo;t doubt that he&rsquo;s got a lot to offer.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>My friend Paul writes about <a href="http://paulfcockburn.blogspot.com/2008/12/hallelujah.html">the winner of <em>The X-Factor</em>'s shot at the Christmas number one</a> with a cover of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'.  Since the original is one of my favourite songs of all time, I have opinions on the matter.
<p>Not least about the assertion that Paul quotes (without holding that opinion himself) that Jeff Buckley&rsquo;s version is &ldquo;often described as definitive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I had heard Buckley&rsquo;s version before today, but definitive?  <em>Definitive</em>?  How could anyone say that?  The definitive version is, by definition, Cohen&rsquo;s.  And the only cover that matters is John Cale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I <em>had</em> heard Rufus Wainright&rsquo;s version.  In my opinion it is too respectful.  And too slow.  I like a cover version that does something new with a song, that grabs it by the throat and make&rsquo;s it the coverer&rsquo;s own.  Think of Hendrix&rsquo;s version of &lsquo;All Along the Watchtower&rsquo;, or the Clash&rsquo;s of  &lsquo;Police and Thieves&rsquo;  Or &lsquo;I Fought the Law&rsquo;, for that matter; there are those who don&rsquo;t realise that&rsquo;s a cover.  You could say that the Clashified version is - I don&rsquo;t know: <em>definitive</em>, maybe.</p>
<p>I maybe be in danger of self-contradiction here, but I don&rsquo;t think so: I fully accept that it&rsquo;s possible for someone to improve on the original version of a song.  I just don&rsquo;t think that anyone I&rsquo;ve heard has done that for &lsquo;Hallelujah&rsquo;.  Except <em>maybe</em> John Cale.</p>
<p>Having done some research into the matter (Last FM and YouTube are really <em>astonishingly</em> cool things) Buckley&rsquo;s currently stands at second-best cover version/third-best version I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard Alexandra Burke&rsquo;s version, except for a fragment in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7783704.stm">a BBC quiz</a> (7 out of 8, by the way), but I fully expect to cringe when I do.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when looking for Buckley&rsquo;s version on Last FM, I saw a comment to the effect that the version in <cite>Shrek</cite> is Wainright.  Well, (I thought) either Rufus has become Welsh; or they redubbed the film for the UK market; or some people can&rsquo;t tell the difference between two very different singers.  But it turns out (at least according to that same BBC quiz) that while the version in the <em>film</em> of <cite>Shrek</cite> is Cale&rsquo;s as anyone with an ear can hear, the version on the <em>soundtrack album</em> is Wainwright.  Strange, but doubtless to do with licensing issues.</p>
<p>I wonder if they replaced that terrible version of &lsquo;Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn&rsquo;t Have Fallen in Love With)?&rsquo; from the film with the proper version for the soundtrack album?</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>This is, in effect, a [Singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) story, though a rather gentle, slightly comic one.
<p>The AIs that gain self-awareness and seek to achieve independence and change the world, start out as part of an educational project called the Museum of the Mind.  In this construct there are a number of simulations of figures from history (mostly fictional, like the  victorian prostitute).  School pupils, students, researchers and others can interrogate them about life in their time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that Byrne has them start to gain self-awareness after their systems get infected with a religious program: a virus that tries to &lsquo;convert&rsquo; them to Mormonism.  I don&rsquo;t know whether Byrne is trying to tell us that religion is necessary for self-awareness, or if it just seems like a useful trigger to give the programs some extra input and start them asking questions.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the erams, as they are called (electronic recreation of a mindstate) is based on an early-20th-century socialist activist.  Shocked at the apparent absence of socialism in the world he sees outside the computer networks, he organises his fellow erams, and sets out to change the world (and protect their very existence along the way).  The title stands for &ldquo;This Great Movement Of Ours&rdquo;, which was once a common phrase in speeches by Labour activists, apparently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good fun, if lightweight.  It was published in 1999; I wonder what&rsquo;s happened to Eugene Byrne since then?</p>

			 <html><body><p>So, I've got an iPhone. I walked into the O2 shop near work the other day, and came out half an hour later with an 8 GB phone and a £30-a-month contract.
<p>The device itself is a thing of beauty, in both hardware and software terms.</p>
<p>iTunes, however, is an ugly piece of dingbat&rsquo;s kidneys.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: it does its thing well, from playing music, through purchases, to synchronisation. But my <em>god</em>, it looks ugly.</p>
<p>And nor do I like the way it presents the music it knows about; but then, I&rsquo;ve never seen an application that does that very well.</p>
<p>As to typing with the on-screen keyboard, well, it&rsquo;s actually not that bad; it&rsquo;s never going to. Be fast, bit there are some smart optimisations, like automatically switching back from the symbol keyboard to the letter one when you hit space after a comma, or immediately after you type an apostrophe.</p>
<p>And I almost cry with happiness every time I see the transition from one app to another.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Went to see <cite><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155592/">Man on Wire</a></cite> last night, the documentary about Philippe Petit's 1974 high-wire walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. It's a great film. I was a bit worried that it would be kind of dull, since we already knew the story. But it's paced like a thriller, complete with starting near the climax and then flashing back to fill in the back story.
<p>I did have a few moments of gut-wrenching horror (I&rsquo;m not good with ridiculous heights, even when it&rsquo;s just images of other people experiencing them), but overall found it absolutely amazing, and touching. Great music, too.</p>
<p>There was a poignant moment when they showed documentary footage of the construction of the twin towers. Seeing pre-formed steel sections being lifted into place; sections that I last saw white-hot and crashing to the ground.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>These are exciting times in Hackney.  Not only has my son just started secondary school today (where did <em>those</em> eleven years go?) but it seems that we are getting a new bookshop near the top of our road.
<p>This is big news indeed.  Our little corner of Lower Clapton is characterised more by chicken-based fast-food joints and kebab shops.  <a href="http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1278/50497.php">A children&rsquo;s bookshop</a> opened on nearby Chatsworth Road a year or two ago (my daughter was their first customer).  There was a brief, exciting moment last year when something that looked like a bookshop opened up on Lower Clapton Road, but it turned out to be a religious booksop, specialising the the Christian field.</p>
<p>But today I went up to get my hair cut, and I noticed a new sign up: <strong>Pages of Hackney</strong>.  A new bookshop on the Lower Clapton Road, opening on Saturday 13th September.  <em>Excellent</em> news.</p>
<p>Not so good is that <a href="http://davehill.typepad.com/claptonian/2007/05/saf_top_barber.html">Saf&rsquo;s Barbers</a> is &ldquo;closed until further notice&rdquo;.

			 <html><body><p>This is actually thirteen books, not just one.  I've been reading it with my son over a period of several months.  He, of course, had already read it, but we like reading together, and I was keen to know the rest of the story, after seeing the film (which is based on the events of the first three books).
<p>Anyway, we finally got to the end, and, while I enjoyed it, I think that Mr Snicket has the not uncommon problem of difficulty with endings.</p>
<p>Or maybe not: he left lots (and lots, and lots) of loose ends flying.  But that might be deliberate, and isn&rsquo;t <em>necessarily</em> a bad thing.  But he seeds <em>so</em> many clues and events throughout the first twelve books that, starting the thirteenth, you wonder how he&rsquo;s going to bring them all together, and then - he just <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>.</p>
<p>Part of the narrative concerns the fact that  stories don&rsquo;t really have starts and finishes, and that a relatively inconsequential moment in your life could be the start or end of someone else&rsquo;s story, and so on. All very well, but I get the sense that he rather tacked that on to excuse the lack of an ending.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s a great story if you&rsquo;re reading to kids who love language (or if you&rsquo;re reading it yourself and do); though some, I&rsquo;m sure, would get annoyed with his repeated &ldquo;&hellip; which is a phrase which here means&hellip;&rdquo; riff, or some of his other running gags.  Me, I loved it.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the three Baudelaire orphans are engaging characters: smart, kind, wise (and noble <em>enough</em>) children, caught up in a world of sadness and madness, where almost all the adults who aren&rsquo;t out to get them are too stupid to help them.</p>
<p>Adults don&rsquo;t come out of </cite>A Series of Unfortunate Events</cite> at all well, in fact.  Those that aren&rsquo;t stupid are evil.  Those that are neither tend to end up  dead, or disappeared.  And everyone gets betrayed, and their hearts broken.</p>
<p>Am I telling too much, here?  Probably not: Lemony warns us, right from the blurb on <cite>The Bad Beginning</cite>: if you&rsquo;re looking for a happy tale, there are plenty of others on the shelves.</p>
<p>While Mr Snicket tries to discourage reading these terrible books at every turn, though, they come highly recommended by me.</p>

			 <html><body><p>We experienced the best and worst of the London cabbie last night: from not taking a fare because to do so would have been a rip-off, to attempted murder.
<p>We were going to an <a href="http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2008/08/21/35158.html">exhibition opening</a>, and had got off the bus wildly too early.  We were walking in the right direction, but weren&rsquo;t quite sure where the gallery was, and we were running late.  So we flagged down a passing cab and asked for the street.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just over there,&rdquo; he said, pointing,  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, indeed, just over there.  Admirable behaviour, I thought, as he could easily have made a few quid taking us there.</p>
<p>After we left and were walking to the bus stop, there was an altercation between a cab driver and a cyclist.  I didn&rsquo;t see how it started, but there was shouting and gesticulation, and the cabbie started to get out of his cab.</p>
<p>The cyclist headed off up the road, and suddenly the cabbie roared off after him.  It looked like nothing less than an attempt to run the cyclist down.</p>
<p>I guess the cabbie came to his senses, because I don&rsquo;t think he actually hit the guy.  The cyclist very sensibly got off the road and cycled down the pavement in the opposite direction.  The cab zoomed off up the road, to fast and  too far away for me to get its number, unfortunately.  I had my phone out ready to call the cops.</p>
<p>The cyclist seemed to be OK, physically at least.  We saw him back on the road and heading in the direction he had been going.  It&rsquo;s scary to think, though, that you could either be that cyclist, or get into that guy&rsquo;s cab.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>This is the motherlode of all brains-in-jars/life-is-a-computer-simulation-type stories.  Gibson's and the Wachowskis' Matrixes can both trace their origins back to here - or at least, they should be able to.  I'm not aware of anything older than this that quite deals with this idea.
<p>At Maiden Castle in Dorchester in the near future (of the time the book was written; it&rsquo;s now our near past) a scientific research project has been under way for several years.  It involves &lsquo;projection&rsquo;, in which the particpants, their bodies unconscious, enter into a shared, simulated fantasy world.  This consensus hallucination was intended to examine a possible future, with a view to suggesting answers to some of the problems of today.</p>
<p>But one of the participants has been stuck in the projection for two years (when the normal period is measured in weeks or a few months at the most); the trustees are getting worried about the costs; and a new participant is about to arrive and change everything.</p>
<p>It is <em>excellent</em>, and (of course) leaves you wondering how many levels of fantasy there are to reality - both the book&rsquo;s, and ours.</p>

			 <html><body><p>What a fine conceit.  Take the two great science fiction works by one of the genre's defining masters, mash them up together, and use the result to tell the 'inside' story of both of them.
<p>It&rsquo;s title is an obvious allusion to <cite>The Time Machine</cite>, but this is actually much more rooted in <cite>The War of the Worlds</cite>.  And why shouldn&rsquo;t those two novels take place in the same fictive universe?  And why shouldn&rsquo;t they be linked?  After all, Mr Wells wrote both the stories down, so he must have experienced some of the events of both, right?</p>
<p>Priest sustains the tone and style of a late-nineteenth/early-twentieth century novel admirably well, and there&rsquo;s not much to fault in this novel.</p>
<p>Except, perhaps, for the ending.  The actual climax and conclusion of the story is well expected if you know <cite>The War of the Worlds</cite>.  It&rsquo;s just the last page or two; the rationale for the behaviour of one of the characters (a Mr Wells, in fact) in particular is, to my mind, inexplicable.  Not that it matters, that late in the story, I suppose, but it does bother me.</p>
<p>I wish I had known about this novel a few years back, when I read both <cite>The Time Machine</cite> and Stephen Baxter&rsquo;s <cite>The Time Ships</cite>.  It would have sat very well in company with them.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I can't decide on this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7450627.stm">David Davis thing</a>. Is it just a stunt?  Is he genuinely concerned enough about civil liberties to take the chance (small though it is) of losing his seat?  Certainly he sounds sincere when he talks about his concerns about the growth of state power; and Shami Chakrabarti of <a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/">Liberty</a> counts him as a friend, it seems.
<p>But as <a href="http://ciphergoth.livejournal.com/313052.html">others have pointed out</a> he has a bad reputation on <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-7936.html">some other rights votes</a>.</p>
<p>Still, there&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that he&rsquo;d be better than &ldquo;Kelvin Mc-bloody-Kenzie&rdquo;:&hellip; (as backed by Rupert Murdoch, of course).</p>
<p>The most concerning thing, though, is the talk to the effect that the public is in favour of 42-day detention without trial.  <em>This</em> member of the public most certainly is not, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m by no means alone.  And honestly: would people who&rsquo;ve really thought it through be in favour of this kind of thing?  I find it hard to believe.  What happened, if it&rsquo;s true, to the great British sense of fair play, of support for the underdog, even of disrespect for authority?  Is this another facet of the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/02/15/human-rights-and-human-gains/">grumbling about human rights</a> that I wrote about before?</p>
<p>Maybe we need to re-educate people about what is good and right.  But how?</p>
<p>And then Ireland have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7453560.stm">voted &lsquo;No&rsquo; to the EU treaty</a>.  I can&rsquo;t help but think that this is a bad thing.  The EU itself has been a net good for Europe and the world, as I&rsquo;ve probably said here before.  Whether these reforms will really make it better and more democratic, or not, I can&rsquo;t say: I haven&rsquo;t studied it.</p>
<p>Thing is, though, I would probably have been in favour of the EU constitution; if only because we could do with one in the UK.  Admittedly, I&rsquo;d want one that got rid of the monarchy and introduced an elected upper chamber in parliament, but one that further enshrined the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> would be a good start.</p>
<p>It would be quite difficult to amend it, mind you, since you&rsquo;d need a Europe-wide referendum.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m havering fancifully here: it was never meant to be that kind of constitution.</p>
<p>What now, then?  Who knows, really.  I expect they&rsquo;ll either re-work it slightly and try again, or just apply various components of it without the treaty.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>A scorching, searing cyberpunk space opera.  It has _everything_ in it: FTL starships, uploaded minds, nanotech, the Singularity, wormhole gateways...  Absolutely stunning stuff.
<p>Though on the downside, I did find it bit hard to follow some of the plot twists and turns.  Specifically, it wasn&rsquo;t always immediately obvious to me why some of the alliances and disputes between the various factions happened.  I expect a more careful reading, or retracing of my steps, would have resolved those difficulties.  But such was the pace of the plot that I didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>I loved some of the terminology.  Travelling faster than light, for example, is called &lsquo;fittling&rsquo; (from FTL).  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">technological singularity</a>  is called the &lsquo;hard rapture&rsquo;.  I especially like that Ken has grabbed the term &lsquo;Rapture&rsquo; from the weirdo fundamentalists christians who believe Jesus is going to come back and sweep them all up to heaven.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex">Googleplex</a> (for example) becoming self-aware and sucking up everyone&rsquo;s mindstate is far more likely, if you ask me.  Which is not saying a lot about its likelihood&hellip;</p>
<p>One of the groupings of humanity that have survived through the hard rapture, and remain players on galactic stage, are called the Carlyles.  They started out as a Glasgow gang, basically.  They were based in something called &lsquo;The Castle on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Clyde">Clyde</a>&rsquo;, which I&rsquo;d like to hear more about.  Then there&rsquo;s AO: America Offline.  They didn&rsquo;t get uploaded because they weren&rsquo;t connected to the net.</p>
<p>This means that the two main dialects of the language everyone speaks are called &lsquo;American&rsquo; and &lsquo;English&rsquo;; but the &lsquo;English&rsquo; is rendered partly in Scots.  Good fun.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read any of Ken&rsquo;s stuff for a while (aside from <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/">his blog</a>, obviously). That&rsquo;s a situation I need to put right forthwith.  But first I think I should go back to the start, and dig <cite>The Star Fraction</cite> out of the attic.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Eric Sanderson wakes without his memories.  In short order he starts receiving messages apparently sent by his former self, is told by his psychiatrist not to read any such messages, and starts reading them - in the wrong order, which leaves him unready for the trouble that is about to assail him.
<p>He is attacked by a &lsquo;conceptual shark&rsquo;: a living, sentient creature that is composed of ideas, of thoughts, of words; and that swims in the sea of information that surrounds us.  This is the creature that took his memories.  It eats such information, and fixates on a victim, and will keep coming back to attack them again and again.</p>
<p>So the messages from &ldquo;the first Eric Sanderson&rdquo; tell him.  Fortunately they also give him some tools and techniques to protect himself, and information about someone who might be able to help him.</p>
<p>So eventually he sets out on a quest to find the mysterious Trey Fidorous.  That&rsquo;s as far as I&rsquo;m going to go with the plot summary (it covers probably a quarter of the book).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting idea, that creatures composed of pure information, of ideas, can exist and can do us harm.  We&rsquo;re well into SF territory here, without wanting to <a href="http://www.chrononaut.org/log/?p=295">hegemonise</a>, and irrespective of the fact that it&rsquo;s marketed as mainstream literary fiction (why, I&rsquo;ve often wondered, don&rsquo;t people talk about &ldquo;li-fi&rdquo;, or &ldquo;cri-fi&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;hi-fi&rdquo;?  Why is SF so special that it gets its own disparaging abbreviation?)  There was real justification for including this work in the <a href="http://www.clarkeaward.com/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=1%3Alatest-news&amp;id=79%3A2008+Shortlist+Announced&amp;tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;page=&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=50">Clarke Awards shortlist</a> (sadly I haven&rsquo;t read any of the others on the list).  We are plunged into a world of infinite strangeness and difference (even though it stands alongside the world we are familiar with).  We have to hang on for the ride and pick things up as we go along.  These are standard, recognised characteristics of much SF.</p>
<p>Which may be neither here nor there, really; unless how we classify a work affects how we approach it, how we read it.  And I think it&rsquo;s true that it does: if you approach Iain Banks&rsquo;s <cite>The Bridge</cite>, for example, as SF (it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;non-M&rsquo;, so it was marketed as mainstream), then you&rsquo;ll get quite a different effect from the scenes on the bridge, and with the barbarian; at least allowing for the possibility that those events actually happened in some sense, in some reality.  As opposed to the assumption that they were &lsquo;only&rsquo; the deranged fantasy of a mind in a coma, which is of course the only &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; reading.</p>
<p>We are in a similar situation here.  Eric&rsquo;s psychiatrist thinks that he might be going into a fugue state; and clearly <em>something</em> has happened to his mind.  But Eric has experienced the attack of the Ludovician (the name of the particular type of conceptual fish that attacked him) and he believes throughout that what is happening is real.  And all through the quest, and the love story and the fight scenes, he believes it.  And so does the author, apparently.</p>
<p>And so do we.</p>
<p>Except.</p>
<p>Except, except.</p>
<p>Right on the second last page, Hall undermines it all.  After the narrative has finished there are a couple of pages of extra material before the &lsquo;undex&rsquo; (the point of which I&rsquo;m not sure about).</p>
<p>The first of these pulls the rug out from under us, and dumps us more or less into &ldquo;he woke up and it was all a dream&rdquo; territory.  Or didn&rsquo;t wake up.  It&rsquo;s a bit like Sam Tyler at the  end of <cite>Life on Mars</cite>, except there it was more or less clearly stated all the way through that he was in a coma: you just didn&rsquo;t want it to be so.</p>
<p>The present work is less honest, in a way, since there really is no suggestion that what Eric is experiencing might not be &lsquo;real&rsquo;.  Sure, it&rsquo;s always there as a possibility, but I&rsquo;d have to say,&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;, really.  Why would you bother to write a story that, in the internal logic of that story, all took place in the head of its protagonist, <em>and didn&rsquo;t do anything to help the protagonist</em>, or illuminate his life, or help him to come to terms with something?</p>
<p>As such, this is ultimately disappointing: it&rsquo;s a great ride, spoiled by the ending.</p>
<p>Although, a further twist occurs to me, a couple of months after reading it.  If the rug-pulling element were <em>not</em> there, you could say, then we would have a fantasy-happy ending, like the fake ending in <cite>Brazil</cite>.  That&rsquo;s never a good thing, of course, but the difference remains this: in <cite>Brazil</cite>, the false ending was tacked on (or it would have been if the &lsquo;real&rsquo; ending hadn&rsquo;t superseded it).  Here, the ending grows naturally out of all that has gone before.  If everything was in his imagination, then fine, so was the ending.  But if everything was &lsquo;really&rsquo; happening to him, then the ending is legitimate in that context, and the additional material subverts it for no good reason.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Or, 'A Fabulous, Formless Darkness', which was Delany's original preferred title, according to Neil Gaiman (him <em>again</em>?) in his introduction to this edition.
<p>Delany writes twisty puzzle-stories, where it&rsquo;s not always clear what&rsquo;s going on, or why. I&rsquo;m a big fan of his later masterpiece, <cite>Dhalgren</cite>, which matches that description, for example.</p>
<p>This one is more straightforward by comparison.  It is Earth&rsquo;s far future.  Humans have gone, and the world is instead inhabited by an alien race.  They have taken over, not just the planet, but humanity&rsquo;s identity, its myths, even its genetics.  And they are struggling to be human.</p>
<p>Or that, at least, is what we are told.  That is what our hero, Lo Lobey, believes, what the elders of his village have taught him.  But personally, I&rsquo;m not convinced.</p>
<p>See, there&rsquo;s nothing here that <em>requires</em> that the characters be aliens; they behave just as humans would, in most cases.  Far-future, post-fall humans, yes, but still they <em>could</em> be humans.  Sure, Lobey has prehensile toes, there are various other physical differences, and there is a neuter (or hermaphrodite, it&rsquo;s not clear) &lsquo;third sex&rsquo;; but none of that is anything that a bit of genetic manipulation - deliberate, accidental, or a combination of the two - couldn&rsquo;t cause.  And there are some psychic abilities, but that is well within humanity&rsquo;s capabilities in thousands of stories, of course.</p>
<p>More importantly, they <em>feel</em> like humans.  As Gaiman says, &ldquo;they are us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is one element that is more alien, though.  That is the curious character of Kid Death, and his (and perhaps some other characters') apparent ability to bring back the dead at will.  The latter could be illusion, of course, and would then be in keeping with the psychic powers I mentioned above.</p>
<p>Why does this matter, you might ask?  Why do I care whether these people are aliens or advanced-and-fallen humans?  In one sense it doesn&rsquo;t matter, of course.  You can enjoy the story while taking the explanation for its background at face value.  But there is, to me, something unsatisfying about the &ldquo;aliens who have taken on the characteristics of humans&rdquo; explanation.  It is too <em>unexplained</em>.</p>
<p>Not that we can or should expect everything to be explained in SF (or not at first, at least); and in Delany&rsquo;s work this low expectation is perhaps lower than in most.  Certainly <cite>Dhalgren</cite>, for example, gives few clues as to what is going on, or how things have got to where they are (it occurs to me, in fact, that it could be set in the same world as the present story).</p>
<p>To have a story about such an alien race, with no examination of what they were like before they took on the role of humanity, or why they did it, seems a curious choice.  But I suppose we could see it as a demonstration of true alienness: there is no explanation of why they behave as they do because we simply <em>could not</em> understand their rationale.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the explanation I like best.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>So <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/may/23/crewebyelection08.byelections3">the Tories took Crewe and Nantwich</a> in the by-election.
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand (never have) the mentality, the mindset, the <em>brains</em> of <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/floating+voter">floating voters</a>.  I&rsquo;m not saying that no-one should ever change their mind, in politics or anything else; nor do I think that people can&rsquo;t be convinced by the arguments over issues - nor, for that matter, swayed by the force of a candidate&rsquo;s personality.  Furthermore, I speak as one who has <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/27082.html">voted <em>against</em></a> Labour, my lifetime-favoured party, in recent years.</p>
<p>But floating voters - and in particular ones who&rsquo;ll switch all the way between Labour and Tory - I just don&rsquo;t understand them.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s possible - even likely - that no-one actually <em>describes</em> themself as a floating voter.  They might all say, &ldquo;I decide on the issues each time,&rdquo; or even, &ldquo;&hellip; by who I like&hellip;&rdquo;  That would be OK, y&rsquo;know?  I could get behind that, sort of.  I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t sound very <em>committed</em>; but it could be.  On each occasion you could examine the candidates' and/or their parties' positions on human rights/the environment/tax cuts/hanging and flogging (or whatever your particular concerns may be).  Match them against your own position and preferences, and see who suits you best.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not convinced that&rsquo;s what the bulk of these &lsquo;floaters&rsquo; do.</p>
<p>See, I suspect that they mostly take little to no interest in politics (which is to say, little to no interest in <em>the world</em>) between elections.  Then when one does roll round they vote whatever way their stupid, dumbfuck tabloid paper tells them to.</p>
<p>Though I may be doing many people a great disservice there.  And at least they do get out and vote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that sometimes the world might be a better place if they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hardy obviously feels similarly to me: on <cite>The News Quiz</cite> the other night he said that floating voters who switched all the way from Labour to Tory (rather than voting, say, Green or LibDem) were like someone saying, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve always had my hair cut at the barbers in the High Street, but this time I&rsquo;m just going to set my head on fire!&quot;</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Paul Cornell wrote some of my favourite episodes of <cite>Doctor Who</cite>'s recent years: 'Father's Day', and the 'Human Nature'/'Family of Blood' two-parter.  After the latter, I downloaded and read the ebook of his original novel (on which the episodes were based).  So I came to this with some knowledge of his writing.
<p>But not with so much knowledge of his religious beliefs.  I had some sense &ndash; from reading <a href="http://paulcornell.blogspot.com/" title="Paul Cornell's blog">his blog</a>, presumably &ndash; that he <em>was</em> religious, at least in a vague, Church-of-Englandy sort of way; but I didn&rsquo;t expect, on picking this up, that it would have such a religious heart (or maybe &lsquo;soul&rsquo; would be more appropriate).</p>
<p>Though I&rsquo;m not sure that the Archbishop of Canterbury would quite approve &ndash; and I&rsquo;m absolutely sure the Pope would not &ndash; of the theology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fine story of a woman who can read the patterns of the world around her, a space pilot from the future (but is it &lsquo;our&rsquo; future?), a disembodied head, and four mysterious &lsquo;golden men&rsquo;, who might be angels, might be the biblical four horsemen of the apocalypse, or might be something else.  It&rsquo;s an easy read, and I recommend it.</p>
<p>But does the religion get in the way of the story?  No, not really; though it was something of a distraction at times for this atheist.  It&rsquo;s by no means preachy; indeed, you could argue that the religious interpretation of the events in the story is a <em>mis</em>interpretation.  Though since that interpretation is the author&rsquo;s, that would depend on where you stand on the whole postmodern thing about the author being irrelevant, and the reader entering into a dialogue with the text.</p>
<p>The question for me on a personal note is, would I have approached it differently - or read it at all - if I had known about the religious content before I started it?</p>
<p>The answer is, I would have approached it differently.  And, if I hadn&rsquo;t known the author&rsquo;s work, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have picked it up at all.</p>
<p>By saying that, I&rsquo;m convicting myself of being likely to prejudge religiously-inspired fiction; well, yes, guilty as charged.  Just as I&rsquo;m likely to prejudge romantic fiction, literary fiction, heroic fantasy, and so on.  We don&rsquo;t approach anything in a vacuum, after all.  Our past experiences, our expectations, colour our understanding and appreciation of any art.  And we all have our preferences.</p>
<p>Still, if I <em>had</em> known, and rejected this, I&rsquo;d have missed out on something worthwhile.  So that&rsquo;s worth bearing in mind.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>You know what's coming.  It's nearly the 1st of May, and that means elections.  An all-too-infrequent chance to exercise our fundamental democratic right and duty.  Always important, even when you're quite happy with how things are.  Somebody else won't be, and you don't want them to change things.
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not what gets people out to vote: a desire for change is much more likely to bring crowds to the local schools, village halls, and other little nooks and crannies of public space that experience a kind of sovereignty for a day.</p>
<p>Either way, there&rsquo;s no better or nobler duty that you can do in a few minutes in a small cubicle with a pencil and a piece of paper.</p>
<p>And if you live in London, and have a vote, please, please, <em>please</em> get out and use it <em>against</em> Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care who you vote for (well, the BNP are standing, but I&rsquo;m sure anyone reading this is much too decent and right-thinking to go there).  Though it&rsquo;s clear that only Ken has a serious chance of keeping the bumbling buffoon out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced, by the way, that the Tories put him up to it as a joke.  The thinking probably went something like, &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s going to beat Livingstone, so let&rsquo;s put comedy candidate up, and make a mockery of the whole thing.&rdquo;  Then somehow, thanks largely to the vile rag that is ??The Evening Standard??, and the lack of seriousness with which some people treat politics, Boris climbed up the polls, and now looks like a serious contender for the Mayorship.</p>
<p>It will be a disaster for London if he gets elected, of course.  We can only hope that it will backfire on the Tories: that he fails fast enough that it seriously harms them in the general election.</p>
<p>Putting your hopes for the country on disaster for your city is no position to be in, though.  So I can only reiterate: get out and vote, and stop Boris.  Give at least your <em>second</em> vote to Ken.  He has his faults, but he&rsquo;s done a pretty good job of running the city this last eight years.</p>
<p>Vote!</p>

			 <html><body><p>I realise that I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/03/20/easter-weekend-plans/">said</a> I would report back from <a href="http://www.orbital2008.org/">Eastercon</a>.  It already seems like quite a long time ago.  I had a great time, though I missed out on the Saturday night and Sunday morning and early afternoon, as I went to collect my son from his grandparents'.
<p>It was his first convention, and I think he quite enjoyed it; though the next time we&rsquo;ll need to ensure that there are some other kids there who like <a href="http://www.yugioh-card.com/">Yu-Gi-Oh! (mental trading card game beloved of ten-year-old boys)</a>.</p>
<p>I saw some old friends and had a fine time.  I was very restrained in comparison with my old conventioneering days.  Early(ish) nights, the lot.  It was quite refreshing to come home on the Monday and not feel at all rough.</p>
<p>The guests of honour were great, those of them that I saw, at least.  I missed &ldquo;Charlie Stross&rsquo;s&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/index.html">www.antipope.org/charlie/b&hellip;</a> speech because of being away for a while, but he was by far the most visible of them all around  the con.   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Mi%C3%A9ville">China Miéville</a> gave a great speech about how it doesn&rsquo;t spoil stories to read more into them than the author consciously intended; or than our interlocutor might say we should (you know, the kind who say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re reading too much into it!  It&rsquo;s just a <em>story</em>!&quot;).</p>
<p>And <a href="http://journal.neilgaiman.com/">Neil Gaiman (the net&rsquo;s no. 1 Neil)</a> was lovely.  He read a short story, and talked for a bit, and then read the start of his new novel <cite>The Graveyard Book</cite>.  Later on, he did a kids-only reading of <cite>The Wolves in the Walls</cite>.  The best part of that was that parents and carers were allowed in too.  He really knows how to handle an audience; even one of the most demanding kind, such as this.</p>
<p>And my boy got his books signed without having to join the apparently-mad queues for the official signing sessions.</p>
<p>Then there was a performance of my friend <a href="http://www.writers-bloc.org.uk/comrades/ajw/">Andrew&rsquo;s</a> play, <cite>The Terminal Zone</cite>, which I wrote about when I read the <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2007/06/14/the-last-of-the-2006-book-notes-posts/">chapbook</a>, It&rsquo;s a fine work.  This particular performance could have done with more rehearsal, but of course, these are amateurs, fitting it all into the rest of their lives, and doing a damn fine job.</p>
<p>That was followed by a live set from <a href="http://www.mitchbenn.com/">Mitch Benn</a>, who I&rsquo;ve been a fan of for some time from his performances on Radio 4&rsquo;s  <cite>The Now Show</cite>, and live, he was absolutely fantastic, especially, I think, since the audience got all his SF references (you don&rsquo;t say) without any prompting.</p>
<p>All in all, a great weekend, in a fine hotel (pity it&rsquo;s lost its swimming pool, though).</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>I've been reading Scalzi's [blog (Whatever...)](http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/) on and off for  a few years, and he comes across as one of the good guys: certainly on the side of light, a good laugh, and someone you imagine would be fun to meet.  So I've been meaning to read his SF for a while.
<p>My thanks to his publishers, Tor, then, for making his debut available via their free ebooks programme.  I read most of it on the Eee PC, with some bits on my phone (when I was standing up on the  tube).</p>
<p>In short, I loved it; though I have some doubts, or reservations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a curious universe (or at least, galaxy) that he describes: it is <em>teeming</em> with life, intelligent life; but nearly all of it is antithetical to nearly all of the rest of it.  Certainly, it is a book about war (the clue&rsquo;s in the title); but it&rsquo;s not one war between humanity and another alien race.  Instead it&rsquo;s a series of small wars to defend human colonies from alien attackers, and to attack alien colonies and capture the planets for humans.  And once our hero joins up, he is <em>constantly</em> at war; there is no respite, at least that we hear of.</p>
<p>And only one, minor, character questions this state of affairs (though others do express their doubts).</p>
<p>I have a feeling, though, that these questions may be addressed in the sequels, which I&rsquo;m keen to read (more proof, were it needed, that giving things away can be a good thing for authors and publishers alike).</p>
<p>The &lsquo;old-man&rsquo;s&rsquo; bit is that you can only join up when you reach 75 years of age.  You relinquish your Earth-nation&rsquo;s citizenship and are legally considered dead.  Members of the Colonial Defense Force can <em>never</em> return to Earth.</p>
<p>But to make up for that, you get a new youthful body, and (if you make it through your tour of duty) the opportunity to have a new life on a colony planet.  The Colonial powers being technologically far in advance of Earth (which has become a bit of a backwater), there is not similar life-extension technology available to those on Earth.</p>
<p>So you can see the temptation.  Peaceful soul that I am, I can imagine that I might take up the offer.  Life is better than the alternative, you know?</p>

<p>When I was last at the <a href="http://www.radissonedwardian.com/londonuk_heathrow">hotel in question</a>, it had a swimming pool.  That has since been filled in, sadly.  Then again, when I was last there, I don&rsquo;t think that I actually used the pool, so perhaps it&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll report back here on how it was (unless, you know, I don&rsquo;t). Actually, come to think of it, there&rsquo;s said to be free wifi in the hotel, so I&rsquo;ll probably report back <em>from</em> it.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Volume 2 (or the second half of volume 1, depending on how you look at it) of Charlie's 'Merchant Princes' series.
<p>It continues the story of Miriam Beckstein and her recently-discovered alternative-universe family of &lsquo;world-walkers&rsquo;.  In this one, Miriam discovers that (not surprisingly) there is more than one alternative Earth, and takes advantage of that fact.</p>
<p>Two things bother me about all this, though. One is that at no point, it seems, does she or anyone else do any investigation into the world-walking ability, or the designs of the talismans that make it work.  Though I have reason to believe that that point gets addressed in a later book.</p>
<p>The other problem I have is just how <em>capable</em> Miriam is.  She&rsquo;s a can-do hero in the Heinlein &ndash; even in the Doc Smith &ndash; mold.  Which is all very well, and all kudos to Charlie for making such a figure a woman, rather than the ubiquitous men created by those illustrious earlier writers.  But those characters were never very believable, and we live in more sophisticated times now, do we not?  So it&rsquo;s hard to believe in someone relatively ordinary who finds themself in another universe, and who just copes.  Indeed, not <em>just</em> copes, but prospers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve said elsewhere that we don&rsquo;t read SF for the characters, but for the stories (and the ideas, of course).  And this is a great story that I sat up late to finish.  And you can&rsquo;t argue with that.</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>My son will be starting secondary school in September this year.  So towards the end of last year we spent a lot of time reading up on the policies of our and adjoining London boroughs, visiting schools, and finally applying.
<p>The application works like this.  You can name up to six &ldquo;preferences&rdquo; (not &ldquo;choices&rdquo;, note).  A central (London-wide, but I&rsquo;m not sure under what body &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think the GLA handles education) body assesses your application against the entry conditions of your first preference.  If you meet those conditions, you get a place in that school; if not, they go on to your second preference; if you meet that school&rsquo;s conditions, you get a place there, and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite as simple as that, of course, because schools' entry conditions don&rsquo;t just apply to your child in isolation; they have to take account of how many people are applying, and how many of those fall into each of the entry conditions, and so on.  As well as that, not only do different boroughs have different conditions, but so do different schools within a borough.</p>
<p>The entry conditions of most state schools, including the new academies, depend primarily on distance from the school.  There are special conditions for children with special needs, but that&rsquo;s a small minority.</p>
<p>Now, all of this raises a number of problems &ndash; or contributes to them, at least.</p>
<p>First is the fact that different schools have different entry conditions.  This applies in particular to the new academies.  Our closest, non-denominational, mixed-gender, state secondary, is Mossbourne, the much-cited flagship of the government&rsquo;s new academies programme.  We live about 900 metres from it, according to Google Maps.  Close enough, you&rsquo;d think.  But their admissions policy goes something like this:</p>
</p><ul>
<li> the first 10% if the year's intake goes to kids with special needs;</li>
<li> next, you get priority if you have a sibling already at the school;</li>
<li> about 60% of the remaining places go to the nearest kids within a 1km "inner zone";</li>
<li> the rest go to kids outside the 1km zone, but not by simple  proximity; it now depends on how far away the  next-nearest non-denominational, mixed, state school is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Confused?  Most parents who have kids going up were.  And it&rsquo;s further complicated by the fact that there&rsquo;s a test.  Not a pass -or-fail test, of course: this is still a comprehensive school, so there&rsquo;s no selection by ability allowed.  Rather, this test is used to split the kids into ability bands.  The entry conditions then ensure that an equal proportion of kids from each band is offered a place.  This is to ensure that the school  has kids of a range of abilities; to ensure that it is truly comprehensive, if you will.</p>
<p>None of that is inherently bad: a school can&rsquo;t take every kid, if more want in than it has places, so it has to have some conditions by which to decide which ones to take.  And ensuring that you take on kids with the full range of abilities is egalitarian and in keeping with the comprehensive principle.</p>
<p>The problem comes when the school is oversubscribed, and so is the next one in the area, and the next; and when <em>they all have different entry criteria</em>.</p>
<p>Such is the situation in our corner of Hackney.  Well, across Hackney as a whole, but we happen to be in one of the more problematic corners, since we&rsquo;re right at the edge of the borough.  That wouldn&rsquo;t matter if the Hackney schools gave priority to Hackney kids, but they don&rsquo;t: their distance criteria are based on pure straight-line measurements, ignoring borough boundaries.</p>
<p>Again, <em>that</em> wouldn&rsquo;t matter so much if all the other boroughs did the same.  But they don&rsquo;t.  Our neighbours Tower Hamlets, for example, not only give priority to Tower Hamlets residents, they also have tied primary schools.  If your kid goes to one of these, then they are <em>guaranteed</em> a place in the associated secondary school, if they (you) want it.</p>
<p>But this is not intended to be a big bowl of sour grapes.  Our boy almost certainly won&rsquo;t get into any of the Hackney schools, but he should get into the next-nearest one, which is just over the border into Waltham Forest.  And all of this may be moot, anyway.  But more of that later.</p>
<p>I referred in my title to &ldquo;the myth of choice&rdquo;, and I was careful to stress above that the application process allows parents and children to specify their <em>preferences</em>, rather than choices.  That&rsquo;s because of what happens next, after the application process has come up with a school for your kid.</p>
<p>You get an offer.  One offer.  That&rsquo;s it.  (Or maybe none, in which you have to run around frantically making further applications.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it was when I applied to university (and probably still is for university applications today).  There, you could apply to five (or was it six?) institutions using the UCCA (now UCAS) form.  They all assessed your application, and up to <em>all</em> of them made you an offer.  You could then choose among your offers and decide  which place would suit you best.</p>
<p>That was choice.  For secondary schools. despite what the government might tell you, there is no choice.  All you can do is state your preferences.</p>
<p>Our particular dilemma had another wrinkle, though.</p>
<p>See, he and some of his friends decided that they wanted to go to something called The Latymer School, in Edmonton.  I was surprised when I found out that this is a grammar school.  Now, some years ago I was surprised to discover that these things still exist in England.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that when the comprehensive system started in Scotland, it was done properly: we got rid of <em>all</em> the grammar schools and Secondary Moderns, as far as I understand it.  So as I say, it was a surprise when I realised they still had some in England.</p>
<p>But even then, I thought they were restricted to Kent and a few other places.  I had no idea there were any in London.</p>
<p>Still, there we were.  We weren&rsquo;t about to forbid him to look at a particular school, despite our natural left-wing reaction to the idea of a selective school.  Perhaps of more concern is that he would be going out of the borough, with both a long journey to get there, and a less ethnically diverse mix than he&rsquo;s used to from primary.</p>
<p>When it came time to stating our preferences, we let him have the final word.  Which is a lot of weight to put on the shoulders of a ten-year-old, perhaps, but it&rsquo;s better than pressuring him into going somewhere he&rsquo;d rather not go, and driving him away from us.</p>
<p>One thing I can say: selection by ability is obviously better than selection by ability to pay.</p>
<p>And another: we&rsquo;ll be incredibly proud of him wherever he goes.</p>
<p>He got through the first battery of tests, and took the second; and we&rsquo;ve been waiting since then.  And tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll know.</p>

			 <html><body><p>So, the latest Banksie.  Always a treat, of course, and especially so when it's a novel of The Culture.  This one, though, is slightly disappointing.
<p>It&rsquo;s not actually <em>bad</em> &ndash; certainly not badly written (though he does overuse the phrases &ldquo;appeared to be&rdquo;, and &ldquo;looked like&rdquo;, when describing things; I was told off years ago (by Lisa Tuttle, no less) for  using &ldquo;seemed&rdquo; when describing something: &ldquo;it either is, or it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;ve been painfully aware of that word, and phrases that take its place, ever since).  It&rsquo;s just not as <em>good</em> as we&rsquo;ve come to expect, which is  a disappointment.</p>
<p>The main fault is that he describes too much of the scenery, to the point where it all starts to get a bit much.  He didn&rsquo;t always do that, I don&rsquo;t think.  Or maybe he did, but it was better executed, and so not so noticeable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the tale of some of the inhabitants of a level on a ShellWorld, and how they come into contact with The Culture, and why, and what follows.  All good stuff, with plenty of fabulous tech.</p>
<p>But you know what was the most annoying thing about it?  The cover.  It shows a human figure in silhouette, walking away from (or it could be toward) our PoV.  On the horizon a city is burning.  Overhead there are stars.  It&rsquo;s not annoying because no scene remotely like it happens in the book (well, there is one scene a bit like it, but she isn&rsquo;t on foot).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s annoying because of the shadows.</p>
<p>The figure&rsquo;s shadow shoots out to its left, implying that there&rsquo;s a strong light source to the right; a rising or setting star.  But the burning city is giving off  lot of light, too.

<p>A photo of one of my recent technological acquisitions, as taken by the other.  It&rsquo;s hard to take a photo of a new camera, unless you have another.  And since this <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0708/07082005canong9.asp">Canon Powershot G9</a> is the first digital camera I&rsquo;ve had&hellip;</p>
<p>Both of them are fabulous.  The Eee is finally an almost perfect replacement for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_5">Psion 5</a> as mobile writing platform (much more powerful, but not as pocketable).  And I&rsquo;m taking the camera everywhere and filling up hard drives with the results.  So expect to see more pictures appearing here.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I'm trying out a different theme on here for a while, along with a  Wordpress Plugin called <a href="http://web.twelvehorses.com/projects/quickpost/">QuickPost </a>.
<p>Both the plugin and the theme are supposed to make WordPress be usable a bit like <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>.  There are a number of flaws, though.  The theme (<a href="http://www.lofitribe.com/2007/09/25/tumble-hybrid-sandbox-port-theme/">Tumble-Hybrid</a> by <a href="http://www.lofitribe.com/">Tribe</a>) is perhaps a bit too simple.  I&rsquo;m all for a clean, simple look, but this might have gone too far.</p>
<p>And the plugin doesn&rsquo;t allow for a preview before posting (as well as not working properly with Flickr, though presumably that will be fixed in due course).</p>
<p><em>Edit</em>: No, that won&rsquo;t do at all.  One or other of them disabled comments and lost the title (even though &ldquo;Allow Comments&rdquo; is ticked, and the title appears, in the main editor.</p>
<p>I suppose the thinking is that, for something quick and dirty you don&rsquo;t want comments or titles, but I do.  Even <a href="http://devilgate.tumblr.com/">Tumblr has titles</a>, if not comments.</p>
<p><em>Edit 2</em>: Well, a bit of CSS hacking sorted that out.  But posting photos isn&rsquo;t working at all as I would expect.  That may be to do with the fact that I&rsquo;ve never really dealt with posting images before, though, rather than the plugin or theme.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>It is a <em>tragedy</em> that a member of the public, when interviewed on the radio, should say, when the phrase "human rights" comes up, "Oh, bloody hell, human rights, suffin fussin wussin mumble grumble," in a tone of disgust.
<p>The subject being discussed was the <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Children39s-chief-calls-for-ban.3768795.jp">call to ban</a> this &ldquo;Mosquito&rdquo; device, which is intended to stop kids and teenagers from hanging around shops or elsewhere by emitting an annoying noise which is too high for older ears to hear.  But it could as easily have been the <a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article3426814.ece">bugging of prisoner-lawyer conversations</a>, or one of a dozen other triggers for what <a href="http://davehill.typepad.com/bigbritain/">Dave Hill</a> calls the <q><a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/dave_hill/2007/11/this_dying_breed.html">seething classes</a></q>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, people: human rights are a <em>good thing</em>.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quite believe I&rsquo;m having to write that.  Again: human rights, and governments upholding them, are <em>good</em>.  An unequivocal good.  There&rsquo;s no question here; we&rsquo;re not in any kind of moral grey area.  Some things are as stark and as plain as the type and the paper on some of the entities I&rsquo;m about to blame: treating people with equality before the law, with respect; acknowledging a basic set of rights to which every human being is entitled, and striving to make those rights available to everyone: these things are an unequivocal good.</p>
<p>Let me spell this out in words of one syllable:</p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s what our parents and grandparents fought the fucking <strong>war</strong> for!</em></p>
<p>OK, went a bit over my syllable count there.</p>
<p>It is just a few  years since the incoming Labour government passed the Human Rights Act, incorporating into UK law the European Convention on Human Rights; how has our country got to the position, since then, that &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; has become a swear word?</p>
<p>I blame the tabloids.  Specifically, I blame the right-wing, ranting, seething, whinging rags of the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>, and the Murdoch-owned scumsheets.  I blame big business and the CBI; I blame the petty little-Englander mentality of a disturbingly vocal minority of the citizens of our great, multicultural nation.</p>
<p>What is to be done about it?  How do we regain the natural state of the British psyche, where we stick up for the underdog, as well as have a respect for natural justice?  Or, if not  regain it (since it hasn&rsquo;t really gone anywhere) at least make its voice audible again?  How are we to make the complainers tone down, or better, teach them, show them, that human rights are for  everybody (even the complainers), not just for the tiny minorities whose stories get wildly inflated in the tabloids; and that even those tiny minorities (where they actually exist) deserve the protection of those rights; and perhaps above all, that our society, our nation, is enriched and improved by our granting and acknowledging those rights?</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>I hadn't read any Amis before (either of them), but I've wanted to try Kingsley for a while; mainly for his SF connections, but when I saw this in a second-hand bookshop I thought it might be a good place to start.
<p>This one isn&rsquo;t SF, of course.  Instead, it&rsquo;s described as a &ldquo;comic novel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have to say that I found very little in it to laugh at.</p>
<p>Oh, the odd chortle, or wry grin, certainly; in particular there is a description of a hangover that has been quoted often enough that I recognised it in its entirety.</p>
<p>But our national sense of humour must have changed since 1954, or something.  Not to mention a great deal more about our society and the way we interact.  At times in this novel I found it harder to understand the motivations of the characters than of the  most alien of characters in SF (well, ok, not to the extent of <a href="https://www.lexal.net/scifi/scifiction/classics/classics_archive/carr/carr1.html">&lsquo;The Dance of the Changer and the Three&rsquo;</a>, say, but anything less than that).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no bad thing, but since it wasn&rsquo;t the intent of the author, that sense of confusion or dislocation can leave you feeling lost.  This is quite different from the effect you can get in good SF, where you&rsquo;re thrown in at the deep end, not quite knowing what&rsquo;s going on.  There, you just hang on and enjoy the ride, trusting in the knowledge that it&rsquo;ll become clear in time.</p>
<p>In this case there&rsquo;s no hope of an explanation, because Amis didn&rsquo;t realise that the behaviour of his sexually stilted 1950s academics would be quite so opaque and mysterious to a reader in the zero-years of the 21st century (why didn&rsquo;t they just go to bed, already?)</p>
<p>Still, as a gentle rom-com, it wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>... for now, at least
<p>(What, you think that&rsquo;s a spoiler?  You saw the future world when Sylar had healing powers: <em>obviously</em> that one wasn&rsquo;t going to come true).</p>
<p>You know, some things shouldn&rsquo;t have a second series.  They are perfect bite-sized little vignettes as they are (OK, pretty big bites, and not so much of the &ldquo;ette&rdquo;, in this case).  Their story is told, and while it may not have a tidy conclusion to every thread, it has at least reached a satisfying point at which to stop; there are no downright cliffhangers left.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like life: there are no beginnings, no endings; not really.  Only a continuing narrative that we pay more or less attention to; and that we eventually have to stop reading (or writing), and put away forever (which last fact is intensely annoying, and the sooner we can <a href="http://www.singinst.org/blog/2007/06/16/transhumanism-as-simplified-humanism/">edit it out of our reality</a>, the better).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad that <cite>Heroes</cite> is over; but in a way I&rsquo;m sadder that it&rsquo;s going to go on.  Because there will be inevitable deterioration &ndash; I read recently that Tim Kring has <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20158840,00.html">apologised about the quality</a> of some Season 2 eps (oh, there are a few mild spoilers for Season 2 at that link; or not so mild, depending on how you feel about them) &ndash; there will be <a href="http://jumptheshark.com/">shark-jumping</a>.  And eventually it may fall to the lowest common denominator of all serial drama: soap opera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at <em>you</em>, <cite>Desperate Housewives</cite>.</p>
<p>And things that <em>should</em> go on, that <em>need</em> to go on, don&rsquo;t get to.  One of these days &ndash; and it must be soon, I think &ndash; <cite>Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip</cite> is going to finish, and then it&rsquo;ll be gone forever, irrespective of what plot threads are dangling.  Bummer.</p>
<p>I fully support the WGA writers' strike, by the way.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I just heard John Bell of the Iona Community on 'Thought for the Day'.  He was talking, since it's St Andrew's day, about the old Scottish saying, or toast, "Here's tae us, wha's like us?  Damn few, and they're a' deid."  That's, "Here's to us, who's like us?  Damn few, and they're all dead," in case you have trouble with Scots.
<p>Thing is, Bell was bemoaning the attitude he thinks it represents.  He thinks it means, &ldquo;The only people we can emulate are dead.&rdquo;  He thinks it epitomises a &lsquo;national inferiority complex.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how I ever understood it.</p>
<p>Rather than looking back wistfully on past glories, to me it was triumphal, celebratory, even arrogant, if you need a negative adjective.  It said &ndash; it says &ndash; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here, and we&rsquo;re great; there&rsquo;s no-one like us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So happy St Andrew&rsquo;s day: we <em>rock</em>.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>.A mindfucking mindfuck of all mindfucks.  A great, big, sprawling book, and yet one which can have a curious sense of claustrophobia at times.
<p>That&rsquo;s because nearly all the action takes place on the floating city of Armada.  It&rsquo;s a <em>big</em> floating city, but it is, nonetheless, essentially a big ship, in the middle of a great ocean, and there&rsquo;s nowhere for the characters to go.</p>
<p>What they do while stuck there, is where the fun lies.</p>
<p>While I was reading this, my beloved got our son a copy of China&rsquo;s first book &ldquo;for younger readers&rdquo;, <cite>Un Lun Dun</cite>.  He finished it over a long  weekend&rsquo;s trip to Cornwall, and I read the review of it in that Saturday&rsquo;s <cite>Guardian</cite> (yes, we buy our kids books in their week of release, why do you ask? Like much of the country, we did the same in July (though to be fair, that wasn&rsquo;t just for the kids.))</p>
<p>The review ended with a statement of the old canard about SF&amp;F having no characters, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s why some readers like them&rdquo;, to paraphrase.  And while that&rsquo;s kind of insulting (and not even true for  <cite>Un Lun Dun</cite>), there is some truth in it.  But then, that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re here for: you don&rsquo;t come to a book like this to read about the inner turmoil of a North London writer (I can get that by <em>not</em> reading.  OK, East rather than North, and would-be, but still.)  You read books like this to take you somewhere <em>else</em>; to experience something <em>other</em>; to see something you <em>can&rsquo;t</em> see down your street.</p>
<p>And you certainly get your money&rsquo;s worth with this one.</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>I had a slightly weird experience with train bookings a while back.  Twice I've booked tickets via <a href="http://thetrainline.com/">The Trainline</a> between London and Glasgow (once on my own, once for the whole family).  On both cases the tickets arrived with the legend "No Seat" printed in the spaces for the seat details.  In both cases I phoned the company and was able to arrange seats (with greater or lesser difficulty and need to switch services)
<p>But the weirdness to my mind is that on The Trainline&rsquo;s website, you have to select specific trains when you&rsquo;re booking (even if the ticket you are buying is flexible enough that you can travel on a different service in the end).  So you&rsquo;re always &ldquo;booking&rdquo; a particular train; but not, automatically, booking a seat.  What, exactly, does it mean to do that?</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s assume that all seats on the train are full when you get on, as they usually are on routes like London to Glasgow; is there a particular circle of floor space that is yours?  You have a booking on that service, after all: it must mean <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>I recall, years ago, when I used to travel up and down these lines a lot, that there were a lot of services, especially at weekend peak times, on which seat bookings were &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo;.  There were still people without bookings who got on and crammed in between the carriages, so I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what that meant, either.  But at least it meant that when you booked a ticket (at a station or a travel agent: no web in those days), you also booked a seat.</p>
<p>And having booked it, you nearly always got it; British Rail had its problems, but incompatible systems between the booking agents and the different train operating companies wasn&rsquo;t one of them, as it seems to be now.  The Trainline&rsquo;s other strangeness was that, after phoning to add the seat bookings, I was sent the details for the outgoing service (on Virgin Trains), but not those for the return (on GNER).  When that happened on the first of those trips, I assumed it was a mistake, so I mentioned it when I phoned for the second one.  I was told that it was unavoidable because GNER use a different system, and they (The Trainline) were only able to book on paper (and then, what, <em>post</em> the details to GNER?)</p>
<p>I blame the Tories, of course: privatisation was always an appalling idea.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I flew up to Scotland the other weekend, by RyanAir.  On the way back the plane was a 737-800.  It was the same kind of plane as on the flight up, but the inside was dramatically different.
<p>Flying north we had standard velour-covered (or whatever you&rsquo;d call it: fuzzy cloth) seats, and standard seat-back pockets  made of criss-crossed bungee cord.</p>
<p>But southbound we had nasty vinyl-covered seats.  Vinyl!  Who&rsquo;d have thought you could still cover seats in such a thing?  It looked like the inside of a 1970s Vauxhall Viva!</p>
<p>Worse than that, though: there were no seat-back pockets at all!  None!</p>
<p>This arrangement means that the little bits and pieces you want to have to hand &ndash; bottle of water, MP3 player, book or magazine, notebook &ndash; all have to go on the floor under the seat in front when you&rsquo;re not holding them.</p>
<p>As well as being inconvenient, those things on the floor all now constitute an added safety risk: if there was some kind of problem before takeoff or after landing, they&rsquo;d all be sliding about, just perfect for people to trip over or slip on.</p>
<p>So, reduced comfort, convenience <em>and</em> safety.  Nice one, RyanAir.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Spoilers ahead.
<p>I watched <cite><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398808/">Bridge to Terabithia</a></cite> last weekend.  It is probably the saddest film I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and despite <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2007/04/30/bridge_to_terabithia_2007_review.shtml">all</a> the <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/review/Bridge_to_Terabithia/3658296">plaudits</a> it has received, it has at its core, I think, a heart of darkness.  It is not a bad film, but it has a dark soul.</p>
<p>I came to the film cold.  I&rsquo;ve not read the book; indeed, I&rsquo;d never even <em>heard</em> of it when the film came out.  The book is described in terms of being &lsquo;<a href="http://www.realmovienews.com/dvd/reviews/1667">much-loved</a>&rsquo; and a &lsquo;<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2160370/">classic</a>&rsquo;.  It was published in 1977, when I was 12 or 13.  So I expect I missed it because I was &lsquo;too old&rsquo; for children&rsquo;s books, and not yet old enough again for them.  And I had <a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/">other concerns</a> in that year.</p>
<p>So all I knew about it was the &lsquo;from the creators of Narnia&rsquo; tag line, a quick read of the blurb, and the fact that my daughter (6) was interested in it.</p>
<p>As the early scenes unfolded I realised that that I had read a review of it, though.  All that I recalled was a complaint to the effect that in the book, the girl was supposed to be plain, even boyish-looking, while in the film she was Hollywood-pretty (if dressed a little unconventionally compared to her schoolmates).</p>
<p>I think that review explains why my opinion of the film differs so significantly from that of most reviewers: they all seem to have read the book.  Inevitably they review the film in comparison to it, and fuelled by their knowledge of the plot.</p>
<p>So they can describe it as <a href="http://newsblaze.com/story/20070717165318tsop.nb/newsblaze/ENTERTAI/story.html">&lsquo;bittersweet&rsquo;, as having an &lsquo;uplifting&rsquo;</a> ending; even as &lsquo;transcendent&rsquo; (I think that last came from one of the mini-documentaries on the DVD).  Because as they watched, they knew what was coming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often thought that some films &ndash; the later <cite>Harry Potter</cite> ones are particular examples &ndash; must be all but incoherent to anyone who hasn&rsquo;t first read the book on which they are based.  The <cite>Potters</cite> can get away with it, because so many <em>have</em> read the books first.  But in general a film &ndash; or any adaptation from one medium to another &ndash; must work on its own.  It is a separate, new creation, and has to stand or fall as such.</p>
<p>In one sense at least, <cite>Terabithia</cite> fails on this account.</p>
<p>The trouble is not lack of coherence; rather it is excess of impact, and lack of recovery time.  There is certainly some foreshadowing: it is plain that <em>something</em> bad is going to happen.  But the  tragedy when it comes &ndash; and make no mistake, the story <em>is</em> a tragedy &ndash; is too deep, too dark, too sudden.  Yes, true, that&rsquo;s how it would be in real life; and I&rsquo;m not suggesting that movie viewers, including children, should be completely protected from darkness, tragedy or loss.  But here, suddenly, shatteringly, we are no longer watching the film that we thought we were.</p>
<p>Which is not necessarily a bad thing.  But the film&rsquo;s fatal flaw &ndash; or at least the cause of its failure to achieve the uplift suggested by reviewers &ndash; comes after the plunge into darkness.</p>
<p>It is the lack of recovery time, and the content of what time there is.  Yes, a significant amount of time for the characters is compressed into a few swiftly-edited scenes.  Perhaps enough time is represented for the boy, Jess, to come to terms with his loss, or at least to begin to do so.  But it is not enough time for <em>us</em> to do so.</p>
<p>And perhaps because the fantasy elements were (rightly) understated earlier on, we have what feels like a tacked-on fantasy ending.  And it&rsquo;s not even the tacked-on fantasy ending we might want.  Me, I&rsquo;d have liked Jess, the talented artist, to to have ripped out the page of the film&rsquo;s continuity, said, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and sketched a new one.</p>
<p>That, of course, would have made for a saccharine ending, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_(film)#Scenes_missing_in_American_cut">false ending</a> in <cite>Brazil</cite>, or the original cut of <cite>Blade Runner</cite>.  It would have been deemed a mistake (not least because of differing from the book), or at least have been very hard to make work.  It would have betrayed the story.</p>
<p>But the ending that we do have betrays the story too, I think, in a different way.  The descent (ascent?) into fantasy may show that Jess had become closer to his little sister; but it writes Leslie out of his memories of Terabithia.  It ceases to be their magical place, and therefore fails to honour her memory.</p>
<p>Of course it is all to help him to come to terms with his loss; but as his Dad tells him, it&rsquo;s by remembering what was special about her that he can keep her alive.</p>
<p>Above all, though, it all happens too quickly: maybe we, the viewers, could have had just a <em>little</em> more time?</p>
<p>I can only assume that the book does, in fact, provide a more gentle exit for its readers, for it to be so popular.  Though of course, you can take a book at your own pace.</p>
<p>Yet despite &ndash; or more likely, because of &ndash; all of the above, it&rsquo;s a film that will stay with me for a long time; that I&rsquo;ll probably watch again; and whose source-book I&rsquo;ll certainly seek out.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>It seems that <a href="http://www.rezillos.com/">The Rezillos</a>, mighty purveyors of sci-fi (I use the term deliberately, and very carefully) pop-punk reformed somewhere along the line.  And they're playing right here in London on Saturday.  At the Carling Academy in Islington, to be precise.
<p>Seeing them live after all this time would be particularly fine, as I know them best through their second and final album, <cite>Mission Accomplished&hellip; But The Beat Goes On</cite>, which is a live album.</p>
<p>It was recorded at the Glasgow Apollo, which is now, sadly, long-demolished.  But before all that, it was where I went to my first couple of gigs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really do all the recent wave of reforming bands (I didn&rsquo;t even go to see the Velvet Underground when they reformed, which I regret (but I&rsquo;d been burned by one of Lou&rsquo;s solo performances)), but I think I might make an exception in this case.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;ve just remembered that we&rsquo;re invited to a party that night, <em>and</em> there are two other gigs on that evening that I&rsquo;d like to go to (Patti Smith and Richard Thompson).  Damn.</p>
<p>Still, the party is in Islington too, so maybe something can be arranged.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>The most annoying thing about <cite>The Prestige</cite> is the way it ends; though I can see that there was no real reason to continue it after that point.  The story is told, all that can reasonably  be revealed is revealed (without going into preposterous and unnecessary details).
<p>The book is finished; the tale (which, as I&rsquo;m sure you know, is about Victorian magicians, and Nikola Tesla) is told.</p>
<p>And yet I still thought, as I reached the last page, &ldquo;Aw, I want <em>more</em>!&rdquo;  like a kid that wants another bedtime story.</p>
<p>Which is no bad thing, it&rsquo;s fair to say.  Better, as a writer (or almost anything else) to leave them wanting more than to outstay your welcome.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>It's not <cite>The Crow Road</cite>, but then, what is?
<p>In my opinion, the quality of Banksie&rsquo;s non-SF work rose in shallow, slightly wiggly, climb from a high start, to a &ldquo;can do no wrong&rdquo; plateau that includes <cite>The Bridge</cite>, <cite>Espedair Street</cite> and <cite>Complicity</cite>, as well as the aforementioned.  Thereafter it dropped a bit (but who can blame him, after that lot?)  But it never got <em>bad</em>.  (His SF took a different trajectory, and as far as I can tell, it&rsquo;s still climbing.)</p>
<p>So what of this book?  It&rsquo;s a family drama, I suppose you&rsquo;d say, with a mystery at its heart.  Not a &ldquo;whodunit&rdquo;, so much as &ldquo;what got done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slipping into Banksie&rsquo;s world is like pulling on an old, comfy jumper; or maybe a favourite leather jacket would be more appropriate.  So we get recognisable characters, dialogue that you could hear in any pub or home in Scotland, and just a touch of mystery.</p>
<p>The main problem, perhaps, is that there&rsquo;s no great threat over the characters (they might decide to sell the family games business to a big American company, and some of them are against that happening).  So we don&rsquo;t have any real sense of potential doom.  Still, though, finding the answer to the mystery is fun enough, and it&rsquo;s a compelling enough read that I got through it in a couple of days.</p>
<p>In a book like this, the pleasure is in the journey more than the destination.</p></body></html></p>

<p>I must admit that, if you had asked me a few days ago, I would probably have said that I thought that the Bank of England <em>already</em> backed the banks to the extent of protecting people&rsquo;s deposits.  Naive of me, perhaps; but after the Bank extended its line of credit to Northern Rock, and particularly since last night&rsquo;s guarantee by the Chancellor, that their money will be covered by the government, it&rsquo;s clear to an uninvolved bystander that they&rsquo;d be better off staying at home and waiting.  If the government can&rsquo;t cover anything that might happen to NR, then we&rsquo;ve got a much more serious problem than one wobbly bank on our hands.</p>
<p>Like the collapse of the pound.</p>
<p>And it would take the euro down with it; and probably the US dollar, and hence the world economy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an economist, and you can call me complacent; but that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>So leave the queues, people, and go on home (if you&rsquo;ve got that much in savings, you obviously don&rsquo;t have to go to work).  And next time, remember that proverb about eggs and baskets.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Took the kids to see the <cite>Transformers</cite> movie tonight.  It's not a franchise that I grew up with, of course, but my two older nephews were into them when they were kids, and so I was aware of them even before my son started watching the more recent cartoons a few years ago.
<p>But I gather that there is a whole generation of twenty-somethings &ndash; maybe even thirty-somethings &ndash; who went to see the movie with a sense of worry, even trepidation, that it would stamp a great big metal foot all over their memories.  And I gather that, largely, for them, it did not.  I had heard quite good things about it (or I thought I had); and the trailer looked great.</p>
<p>So I was mostly disappointed.  I didn&rsquo;t hate it all the way through; nothing as extreme as that.  I was just disappointed at how weak and overlong it was; and mainly by the American-military porn.  A great deal of it was showing the fantasticness and coolness of American military technology.  I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s really what I want to see in a film I take my kids to (though as it also revealed that all human technology came from reverse-engineering the frozen Megatron, they may have been sending mixed signals).</p>
<p>Also, since it starts with a US military base in the Middle East being attacked (by a giant alien fighting robot, and in Qatar, admittedly, but still), you might reasonably expect there to be some political point.  But there wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Unless, perhaps, it was this.  The grunts (actually Special Forces, so I&rsquo;m not sure we should call them grunts) were shown as cool, professional, skillful and competent.  The secret government agency in charge of crashed alien artifacts, and the FBI, were shown as feeble, useless and pathetic; easily outwitted by a couple of teenagers and, err, a group of giant alien fighting robots.  So, soldiers good, government bad, or something.</p>
<p>Also, one bit that really surprised me was when Megatron and Optimus Prime were fighting: Megatron turned into a plane, Optimus Prime grabbed him, and together they crashed into the side of a tower block and slo-mo&rsquo;d all the way through it and out the other side.  9/11 can&rsquo;t be as raw a wound in the American psyche as I had thought.</p>
<p>We could have done without the whole teen romance thing, but it&rsquo;s an American summer blockbuster, so what can you expect?  And we could have done without at least half an hour of the start.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also incredibly visually noisy, and the Transformers themselves, especially the Decepticons (the baddies) are so similar when they&rsquo;re in robot mode that it was really hard to tell what was going on at times.</p>
<p>But then, what was going on didn&rsquo;t really matter that much.</p>
<p>The kids enjoyed it though, and it was a nice treat to end the summer holidays with; but since we started them with <cite>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</cite>, and middled them with <cite>The Simpsons</cite>, I don&rsquo;t think it really stands up.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s definitely been &lsquo;The Summer of Film&rsquo;, as they were calling it in the trailers a while back.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>At the end of <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2007/07/13/potter-week/">Potter Week</a> we joined the queue in Borders in Islington at about twenty to eleven; we got served at about 1am (and bought a lot more than just two copies of <cite>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</cite>, I might say, thereby justifying notions of the reduced prices as loss-leaders).
<p>On the Saturday there was a picnic-party for some friends who are leaving Hackney, as well as much packing of the car. Then at stupid o&rsquo;clock on the Sunday morning we headed off to Dover for a ferry to France, and two weeks camping in Brittany. My son finished the book on the journey; about 37 hours after its release. I took a couple of days more, and then read it again straight away. Which is something that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever done before. This is not necessarily because it was so great, but more because I read it so fast the first time. Rowling is a great plotter, so sometimes the pages turn too fast.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ll be honest, I kind of didn&rsquo;t want it all to be over.</p>
<p>The holiday was great. Mixed weather, of course, but no worse than here, I think</p>
<p>Then after a week back at work I find myself hitting an important anniversary: Today I&rsquo;ve have been in this job for twenty years. <em>Twenty years!</em> It&rsquo;s hard to credit. I feel like a poster boy for the phrase, &ldquo;Where did the time go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only is it the same job, it&rsquo;s my <em>first</em> job. The company name has changed several times due to takeovers, but it&rsquo;s the same place, and quite a lot of the same people. It&rsquo;s been good, on the whole, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have stayed. But I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder whether it might be time for a change.</p>
<p>Tonight, though, I&rsquo;ll be in <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/10/103/Alexandra/Wimbledon">the pub</a>. On the roof terrace, if the weather holds.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Wow. This is an amazing piece of work. The mother of a high-school killer writes letters to her husband, describing Kevin's life as she experienced it. I can't write a lot about it without getting heavy on the spoilers, but I will just say this.
<p>When I was a few pages in I was getting a strong sense of this absence of a voice: the husband was not to be heard. But then I thought two things. First, <em>all</em> epistolary novels are like that to some extent; though it is possible for the letter-writer to refer to things their correspondent has written in return.</p>
<p>Second, it occurred to me that Shriver, by excluding the man&rsquo;s voice, might have been making a point about the relative exclusion of women&rsquo;s voices in literature. In other words, the way I was feeling might be akin to how Jean Rhys <a href="http://discussingbooks.cohprog.com/dbe/English/WideSargassoSea.htm">must have felt</a> when she read <em>Jane Eyre</em>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, now, think that she was particularly trying to do that, though the effect of the early chapters is still there.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Ah, Joe. I can hardly believe that it's already four years since we lost him. I started reading this on Christmas day, and finished at about two in the morning on the 14th of January: exactly three weeks later. If I read a book every three weeks that would be seventeen in a year, which isn't very many. Anyway, during that time I completely immersed myself in Strummeriana; as well as reading the book I listened to little music other than The Clash or Joe's solo stuff, and I also put my bit in on the various Wikipedia articles.
<p>And none if it can make up for the fact that he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>In fact, reading the book only makes it worse: it reinforces the sense of what we&rsquo;ve lost. He was on a great creative upswing when he died, as the the posthumous <em>Streetcore</em> album showed. Its opening track, &lsquo;Coma Girl&rsquo; (which, we learn, is about his daughter Lola) was the single best song he wrote since &lsquo;Trash City&rsquo;, at least.</p>
<p>Alas, we&rsquo;ll never hear anything new from him again.</p>
<p>Or at least, not truly new: it seems from reading the book that there might be quite a few unreleased recordings out there, and he worked on more film soundtracks than I knew about.</p>
<p>Most interestingly of all, perhaps, is this piece of information. Around the time that Joe and the Mescaleros were writing and recording <em>Global A Go-Go</em>, the second of the comeback albums after the wilderness years, he also sent a set of lyrics to Mick Jones. He seemed to be suggesting that he was considering an alternative to the Mescaleros album. Mick wrote tunes for them and sent them back, but heard no more about it. Some time later, after <em>Global A Go-Go</em> had been released, Mick asked what had happened to the songs. Joe said, &ldquo;Those weren&rsquo;t for <em>Global A Go-Go</em>; those were the next Clash album.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no suggestion that he ever recorded any of them; but you never know: one day Mick might, when he&rsquo;s not too busy with <a href="http://www.carbonsiliconinc.com/">Carbon/Silicon</a>.</p>
<p>What of the book itself, though? Well, it&rsquo;s certainly compelling reading (at least if you&rsquo;re a fan like me). It is flawed in some ways, of course. It can be hard to follow the early sections about Joe&rsquo;s family, without an actual family tree to clarify things, thought that&rsquo;s not a big problem.</p>
<p>Despite its size and comprehensive nature, there are parts that come across as too anecdotal and perhaps incomplete. Certainly there are places where I would have liked to have a lot more detail. But a book this size could be written about The Clash alone (several have, of course, but perhaps none quite the size of this one).</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s totally a must-have for any Clash fan, or solo Joe fan (can you be the latter but not the former?)</p>
<p>I wonder what it would have been like if The Clash had kept going and had become like U2 (who were heavily inspired by them)? In a good sense: I listened to an interview with Salewicz, where he pointed out that, though Joe didn&rsquo;t like the distance from the audience at stadium gigs, he was very good at handling them. So imagine them doing something like the Zoo TV tour (indeed, when I saw footage of that, all the TVs as backdrop reminded me instantly of the Clash Mk II &lsquo;Out of Control&rsquo; tour).</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>Nearly halfway through the year and I haven't finished posting last year's Book Notes? Shocking. Oh well, here are the last few in one bunch.
</p><h3>26: <cite>The Terminal Zone</cite>, by Andrew J Wilson</h3>
<p>My friend <a href="http://www.writers-bloc.org.uk/comrades/ajw/">Andrew</a> wrote this play back in 1993 or so, and produced it at the Edinburgh Fringe. It has now been published as a chapbook by <a href="http://www.writers-bloc.org.uk/">Writers' Bloc</a>, the spoken-word performance group that grew out of the East Coast SF Writers' group.</p>
<p>In it, Rod Serling, the writer and presenter of <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, appears; or rather, two sides of his personality appear, performed by two actors, and indulge in a dialogue. This is the story, you might say, of Rod Serling talking to himself.</p>
<h3>27: <cite>Dicks and Deedees</cite>, by Jaime Hernandez</h3>
<p>A collection of <em>Love and Rockets</em> stories by Jaime. I haven&rsquo;t read any of these for years, but all our favourites are here: Maggie and Hopey, of course, and Penny Century, and HR Costigan, whose story reaches a conclusion of sorts.</p>
<p>His storytelling technique can make it hard sometimes, to tell where we are chronologically: he&rsquo;ll tell the history of years in a character&rsquo;s life in the space of half a dozen or a dozen panels, with nothing other than the pictures and dialogue to indicate that the time has changed. And yet somehow you can work out what is happening, and over what period.</p>
<p>The artwork is gorgeous in its simplicity, of course, and he always has moving stories to tell.</p>
<h3>28: <cite>Tamara Drewe</cite>, by Posy Simmonds</h3>
<p>This graphic novel was published in weekly installments in the Saturday issue of <a href="http://guardian.co.uk/"><em>The Guardian</em></a> over a year or so. Actually, most weeks there were two episodes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m told that it&rsquo;s based on, or at least strongly inspired by, <em>Far from the Madding Crowd</em>, by Thomas Hardy; he is one of my unfortunate missing authors, so I can&rsquo;t comment on that myself. I can say, however, that it&rsquo;s a great story, very moving, and a fine way of bringing graphic fiction to the mainstream reader (not that this is the first time <em>The Guardian</em> has done this: they published Posy&rsquo;s <em>Gemma Bovary</em> a few years ago).</p>
<p>If you missed it, you can probably still read (at least some of) it on the website (though personally I find that unsatisfying because of the image quality). But I expect it&rsquo;ll be out in paperback by now (in fact, I was surprised they didn&rsquo;t get it out in time for Christmas).</p>
<h3>29: <cite>Spin</cite>, by Robert Charles Wilson</h3>
<p>This is an absolute stormer of a book. A family drama, of sorts, set across thirty years and three billion years simultaneously.</p>
<p>The time is about now, and one night (in North America, at least), the stars go out. And the planets and the moon. But not the sun.</p>
<p>The Earth has been enclosed, by an entity or entities unknown (or is it a natural phenomenon?) in a membrane that closes off the outside universe, while allowing enough sunlight through for the ecosystem to function normally. Inside the membrane, time is slowed down, so that outside it the universe appears to spin on at a vastly accelerated rate.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really all about relationships. Highly recommended.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>So there we have it: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,,-6623261,00.html">Tony will soon be gone</a>. I had forgotten some of the good things: the minimum wage; civil partnerships (though why not for het couples?); the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly; the London Mayor and Assembly; Northern Ireland, of course. Even the hunting and smoking bans.
<p>But Iraq; the dodgy dossier; detention without trial; ID cards; ASBOs; and so on and on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a well-respected man, but <em>bullshit!</em> <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=88%22">You could&rsquo;ve been great</a>,&rdquo; as The Waterboys once put it. Actually I wouldn&rsquo;t describe Blair as &ldquo;well-respected&rdquo;, so that doesn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>Should the government go to the country when the party leader steps down? Many think so, but actually, I largely don&rsquo;t. In theory we live in a representative democracy. Citizens vote for a representative for their local area, and the party with the most seats forms a government. If the leader retires - or even is kicked out, though that does put a different complexion on things - that doesn&rsquo;t change the position in parliament. And changing the leader does not necessarily mean a change of government.</p>
<p>On the other hand, calling an election wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad thing for the country, except for one problem: we&rsquo;d probably end up with a Tory government.</p>
<p>Though it shows how bad things have got when I find myself thinking that maybe a Tory government, if they would scrap ID cards, wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad thing.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a worrying thought.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>He could have been great, you know.</p>
<p>We could be sitting here now, raising a glass to the end of the reign of Britain’s greatest Prime Minister of the (loosely-bounded) century, if not ever.  It wouldn’t have been hard.  Look at the two before him: after they had finished their slash-and-burn attack on the economy and the welfare state, all he’d have had to do was put it back together, and things would have got better</p>
<p>And they did do some good; some things did get better.  I’ve spoken before about my approval of the Human Rights Act, and despite its current problems, the NHS is, on the whole, in a better state than it was.  And the economy has seen a kind and duration of stability that you just don’t get under the Tories (never trust a right-winger with your economy: they’re all about  “invisible hands”, and they just don’t know how to run it properly; just look at the way Bush threw away the trillions that Clinton left him).</p>
<p>And the Africa thing.  A real attempt at ending poverty in Africa.  Now that would have been a legacy worth having.</p>
<p>But here we are, now.  He’s squandered all the goodwill he had ten years ago, taken the country into an illegal war, and taken massively Orwellian steps towards the reduction of civil liberties.  In years to come, when you search the net for the phrase “power corrupts”, you’ll find a picture of Tony Blair.</p>
<p>Don’t bang the door on your way out, Tony, and goodbye.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Sometimes I write these things and don’t post them immediately, and then they seem wildly out of date.  But it’s still worth putting them out there.  Blogging doesn’t <em>have</em> to be completely reactive.  Sometimes it should take the longer-term, contemplative view.  So I offer this.</p>
<p>It seems obvious to me that, if your navy personnel are captured by the forces of a foreign power, in peacetime, and accused of being in the foreign power’s waters, then what you should do is as follows:<br>
You say, “Oops, sorry.  Didn’t mean to have them off station; didn’t think they were, actually, but if they were, we’re sorry.”  Even, and let me make this quite clear, if you know <em>perfectly well</em> that they weren’t in the other power’s territory.</p>
<p>That, it seems to me, would be the <em>diplomatic</em> thing to do</p>
<p>So why did they not do that?  My best guess is that they – the British government – were worried about losing face.</p>
<p>‘Losing face.’  It’s a strange thing for the government of what is still a fairly major world power to be worrying about, isn’t it?  After all, it’s not as if making such a guarded admission and apology would actually have done Britain any harm, would it?</p>
<p>And it might have got the captured service people home a few days earlier – and without being humiliated on TV – you never know.  Perhaps, even, the Iranian government would have apologised in their turn, and admitted that <em>they</em> might have made a mistake.</p>
<p>That last seems almost likely, given that they did appear to concede quite graciously in the end.  But what do I know?  I’m neither diplomat nor politician, and there might be some way in which doing what I suggested right from the start would have been political suicide.  And obviously things will have been going on in the background of which we know nothing.  But still…</p>
<p>And then they get home and tell their stories.  I seem to be the only person in the country who thinks like this, but I see no reason why they shouldn’t be allowed to profit from doing so.  <em>Somebody</em> is going to profit from the stories being told, so why shouldn’t it be the ones to whom they happened?</p>
<p>Sure, if it’s against the rules of the service, then that’s the deal they signed up for.  But since the Ministry of Defence authorised it, then at the very least, I  don’t see how you can blame the sailors.</p>
<p>I speak as someone who likes to write; so if I imagine myself into a situation like that, I know I would want to write my story once I had escaped.  And if I could go on to sell it for professional publication, then you’re damn right I would want to do so.  Why not?</p>
<p>The reported reactions of some of the families of service personnel who have died in Iraq is, to my mind, a red herring.  There’s no direct comparison.  As far as I know, there’s nothing to stop those families from writing, telling, or selling their own stories, or those of their lost ones.  If they choose not to, that’s fine.  But the two situations are quite different.</p>

			 <html><body><a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/index.html">Charlie</a> shows that he can write heroic fantasy as well as everything else.  Except, of course, it isn't really fantasy.  When your hero discovers she can switch at will (or "world walk") between the "real" world (present-day America) and an alternative world  (geographically similar, inhabited, but never had industrialisation) then what you are dealing with seems a lot more like SF to me.
<p>Of course, the alternative world works on a feudal system, and weapons are mediaeval (apart from ones that have been carried over from &ldquo;our&rdquo; world).  So it has some of the tropes of fantasy, and more may develop.  But it looks like there won&rsquo;t be any magic other than the world-walking ability.</p>
<p>The main fault with it is that it shows its history as the first part of a much longer book which the publishers decided should be split in two.  So just as it&rsquo;s starting to get really interesting, it ends.</p>
<p>Oh well, I look forward to reading the second part, and its sequels.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>The new __Doctor Who__ episode was butt-kicking excellence!  And Martha is a worthy successor to Rose.</p>
<p>Just replacing the sonic screwdriver like that was a bit of a copout, mind: given that it got destroyed, I thought that they might try to make something of him _not_ having it.</p>
<p>Still, that’s a very minor nitpick; it was much better than the start of the previous series (also set in a hospital, curiously).</p>
<p>A really strong start.</p>

			 <html><body><p>So I ordered the new <a href="http://www.iainbanks.net/">Banksie</a> from Amazon, and to get free delivery, of course, I had to order one or two other things, to bring the price up to the threshold. I tend to have a number of things queued up to buy when the time is right, so I selected some things from that list.
<p>All three items I chose are things that I meant to get at the time they came out, but didn&rsquo;t, for one reason or another. The book was Christopher Priest&rsquo;s <em>The Prestige</em>, which I&rsquo;ve meant to get since I read the reviews when it came out. I&rsquo;m not sure why I never bought it (actually I did buy it once, but that was to give to a friend who had a particular interest in stage magic).</p>
<p>Anyway, my interest was recently rekindled because of the film coming out, of course. I may want to watch it one day, and I&rsquo;m not going to read or not read something on the reported say-so of some film director. I can&rsquo;t find a reference for that: the director is supposed to have said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t read the book before you see the film.&rdquo; Though I suppose that I will, in effect, be doing exactly that &ndash; in a contrary way &ndash; by <em>insisting</em> on reading the book before seeing the film. Whatever: books come first.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t bring you here to talk about books, for a change. No, this time it&rsquo;s music. Because I also got two CDs from Amazon.</p>
<p>Regular readers might not be surprised to hear that I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the late, and sadly missed,Joe Strummer. As such, I want to get a hold of anything he released that I don&rsquo;t yet have. Now, during his so-called &ldquo;wilderness years&rdquo;, Joe did a lot of soundtrack work. I&rsquo;ve got most of that on record, but I never got round to getting the soundtrack for Alex Cox&rsquo;s <cite>Straight to Hell</cite>. I recall hearing a borrowed copy in &lsquo;87 or so, and enjoying it, but not being overwhelmed by it. The one track I remembered was &lsquo;Rake at the Gates of Hell&rsquo;, by The Pogues, more of which later.</p>
<p>In the intervening years, I mostly forgot about the album. Once in a while I might have poked around a second-hand record shop, but it was low on my list of priorities. Recently, though, I discovered that it had been reissued, revised and expanded. Into my &ldquo;buy later&rdquo; list it went, until the other day.</p>
<p>As well, I discovered it was possible to jump back to an earlier part of Joe&rsquo;s career, namely his pre-Clash band, the 101ers. <cite>Elgin Avenue Breakdown</cite> was originally released back in 19-something-or-other. At the time I was mildly interested, but saw no need to rush out and buy it. I had the &lsquo;Keys to your Heart&rsquo; single, and it was OK, but nowhere near as good as the heights of The Clash. And Joe was still around, and we could expect new music from him in the future.</p>
<p>We are in that future now, of course, and we don&rsquo;t have Joe anymore. So buying the 101ers&rsquo; album is a way to hear him again.</p>
<p>And a damn fine album it is. Straight ahead rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll, jam-packed with bounce, verve and excitement. What it doesn&rsquo;t have is the political sensibilities of The Clash. Or actually, it does have the first vestiges of them; and indeed, the first vestiges of The Clash&rsquo;s excellent &lsquo;Jail Guitar Doors&rsquo; (the B-side of &lsquo;Clash City Rockers<sup id="fnref-81-1"><a href="#fn-81-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>'), in the form of &lsquo;Lonely Mothers Son&rsquo;. And I&rsquo;m sure that title should have an apostrophe in it, but I&rsquo;m not sure where.</p>
<p>And the <cite>Straight to Hell</cite> soundtrack? It&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s mostly film music, of course: largely instrumentals. There are selections by Elvis Costello and Pray for Rain, as well as by The Pogues and Joe. Among the proper songs are one by Joe called &lsquo;Evil Darling&rsquo;, which is OK, and the original version of &lsquo;If I Should Fall from Grace With God&rsquo;, which The Pogues wrote during filming, apparently. Then there&rsquo;s a version of &lsquo;Danny Boy&rsquo;, by the cast, led by Cait O&rsquo;Riordan, and the album ends with &lsquo;Rake at the Gates of Hell&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to express how good that song is. From the opening guitar riff, through Shane&rsquo;s crazed-gunman-death-worshipper lyrics, to the shouldn&rsquo;t-work-but-does device of the verse and chorus being exactly the same tune, it struts into your ears and rips your head apart. In a good way. I&rsquo;ve hardly had it off repeat on my MP3 player since I got it.</p>
<p>Go and buy it. Now.</p>

Someone emails their MP and gets an accidentally-sent response (in the MP's name?

<p>So far, so unsurprising (though your attitude towards the government should <em>not</em> affect the service you get from it).  But  the MP has just been on the radio refusing to apologise.</p>
<p>She was very good on defending her staff: they&rsquo;re professional, but they&rsquo;re human.  Fine, people make comments that shouldn&rsquo;t become public, and mistakes get made.  But surely an apology for the mistake would be in order?</p>

			 <html><body><p>These are still the 2006 Book Notes.  I'll finish them soon, honest.
<p>Heinlein used to be my absolute favourite author.  Indeed, he is in large part responsible for me developing a lifelong love of science fiction.  And I&rsquo;m also very fond of Spider Robinson.  So when I found out that this existed, obviously I had to buy it.</p>
<p>It seems that, sometime after the death of Heinlein&rsquo;s widow Virginia, his literary executor discovered an outline that Heinlein wrote in 1955, but never expanded into a novel.  If remarks by Heinlein, that Spider refers to in his afterword, are true, then it was John W Campbell who talked him out of doing so.  Which seems strange, and rather sad.  Still, if Heinlein had written that novel, it&rsquo;s possible that we wouldn&rsquo;t have had one of his other ones; and of course, we wouldn&rsquo;t have this one.</p>
<p>Would that be a good or bad thing, though?  That is what we are here to decide.</p>
<p>I became intensely irritated by the story early on.  The first-person narrator is supposed to be eighteen years old at the start, and he just doesn&rsquo;t sound like an eighteen-year old.  I don&rsquo;t mean the narrative voice: that would not be a problem, as we can assume that the narrator is supposed to be telling his story in later years.  I&rsquo;m talking about his dialogue, and particularly his thought processes.</p>
<p>Tied to this is the fact that we are left largely in the dark about the society on Earth where the novel starts.   The only thing we learn is that sexual mores have gone backwards by several hundred years, in North America, at least.  Our narrator and his beloved can&rsquo;t move in together, or even just spend the night together (despite living independently from any parents or guardians): they have to get married if they want to have sex.  That his how Spider gets round the fifties expectations of Heinlein&rsquo;s outline, of course, but it doesn&rsquo;t sound like any eighteen-year olds I&rsquo;ve ever heard of.</p>
<p>Except, perhaps, those who subscribe to one of the world&rsquo;s many anti-sex religions, which these two don&rsquo;t.  In fact, the handling of religion in this work is quite interesting.</p>
<p>It is slotted into the timeline of Heinlein&rsquo;s &lsquo;Future History&rsquo; stories.  In that timeline, the name of Nehemia Scudder appears, but I don&rsquo;t think there is a story in which he ever appears directly as a character.  Scudder is some kind of Christian fundamentalist leader, who becomes, I think, the World President.  In this novel we are after the time of the Prophets &ndash; Scudder and his successors &ndash; and the world is still recovering from the restrictions that were placed on life, on scientific research, by them: &ldquo;We could have had immortality by now,&rdquo; one character complains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good story, but not as good as it could be.  Robinson has obviously worked hard at &ldquo;channelling&rdquo; RAH, but it seems to me that there are parts of the story where things just don&rsquo;t quite fit together, or totally make sense.  Though this may in part due to the speed with which I read it.</p>
<p>It is, of course, a good thing when a book makes you read it quickly: it usually means that the plot is compelling and you are keen to find out how it will play out.  But if it causes you to skim, and miss &ndash; or at least, imperfectly absorb &ndash; important information, then that&rsquo;s not so good.  Though I don&rsquo;t think that can really be considered a criticism of a book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth a read, and I suppose I might read it again at some point, to see whether I did just miss some bits; but I&rsquo;d probably prefer to re-read, say <cite>Have Space Suit, Will Travel</cite>.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Over the last few weeks I've been trying to write a <cite>Doctor Who</cite> short story. It was for a <a href="http://www.bigfinish.com/news/news_061204_writingcomp.shtml">competition</a> that Big Finish, publisher of DW books and CDs, were running. Alas, the closing date was the 31st of January, which is now past, and I didn't finish it (does that make it a Small Finish?)
<p>Still, I&rsquo;m enjoying writing it, and intend to finish it anyway, just on general principles. It doesn&rsquo;t do to go around having lots of unfinished pieces (and I speak as someone who has a great many unfinished things lying around, of one variety or another).</p>
<p>When I do finish it, I&rsquo;ll probably put it online. Now my question is, does such a work now count as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction?">fanfic</a> I suppose it does, on some level. Curious, because the winner of the competition gets professionally published, and that obviously <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> fan fiction.</p>
<p>Still on a literary note, my friend <a href="http://www.writers-bloc.org.uk/comrades/">Andrew</a> was in town the other night, because he was one of the authors who was doing a reading that was organised by <a href="http://www.farthingmagazine.com/">Farthing magazine</a>. Until Andrew told me about the event, I didn&rsquo;t even know that the publication existed.</p>
<p>It was a good night. I missed the first reading, by Anna Feruglio Dal Dan, but heard various drabbles, Andrew&rsquo;s story, and two other fine stories.</p>
<p>During the interval I picked up the back issues of the magazine and took out a subscription. Then at the end we helped the Editor, <a href="http://www.wendybradley.com/">Wendy Bradley</a>, to carry some boxes back to her flat, and drank her whisky.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a fine night.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I started writing this post while watching <cite>This Week</cite> again.  This time they were talking, inevitably, about the new equal rights legislation (good legislation; from this government?  Amazing.)  The Catholic church is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6243949.stm">trying to have itself made exempt</a> from the new law; and the Church of England has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6293115.stm">come out alongside it</a>.  Or at least John Sentamu has.
<p>It <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6297107.stm">looks like they&rsquo;re going to be smacked down</a> for now, which is good.</p>
<p>I was brought up as a Catholic, but I grew out of it, and am, like any sensible person, profoundly anti-religious now.  And what I say to the Catholics who would try to destroy one of the few good, well-intentioned pieces of legislation that this government has brought in, is this:</p>
<p>We here in Britain are trying to build a tolerant, inclusive, multicultural society.  If you can&rsquo;t work within that, within the laws and regulations that govern adoption, then you shouldn&rsquo;t be in the adoption business.  And if you don&rsquo;t like the way our society is developing, maybe you&rsquo;d be happier elsewhere.  I hear they&rsquo;ve got quite a theocracy going in Iran.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s nothing to stop people saying the same to me, when I speak out against ID cards, for example.  But that&rsquo;s democracy for ya: full of contradictions.</p>
<p>And anyway, it could come to that yet.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>So I finally start <cite>The Baroque Cycle</cite>; or you might say, I finally <em>finish</em> the first volume.  I started reading this at a campsite in France while on holiday: that was back at the end of August.  I finished it on the 9th of November.  As I said not so long ago, I don't read that quickly these days (compared, say, to back when I was a student); but this has taken me <em>ages</em>.  Which is not surprising, since it's 900 pages long.
<p>While I&rsquo;ve been reading it I&rsquo;ve also read 19, 20, 21 and 22, but they are all graphic novels, and quite short.  As well as that I generally read parts of the Saturday <cite>Guardian</cite>; a few magazines (<cite>London Cyclist</cite>, <cite>Matrix</cite> and <cite>Vector</cite>, occasionally <cite>The New Statesman</cite>, or one of the Linux magazines); and of course, a rake of blogs.  But apart from those, it&rsquo;s just been this one steadily for about two and a half months.  And there are two more volumes to go: each, I believe, of a similar length.</p>
<p>None of which tells us anything about the content of the book, of course.  It is an interesting exercise, apart from anything else: Stephenson cleverly educates us science geeks about history, by linking the doings of kings and lords with those of Isaac Newton and other luminaries of the Royal Society.  Or so I first thought.  But then I realised that simultaneously, or alternatively, it does the opposite: it teaches humanities geeks (who presumably can be expected to know about the history) something about the science of the time.</p>
<p>More importantly, though, it&rsquo;s a damn good story.  The first third tells the first part of the story of Daniel Waterhouse, who is the son of a Puritan family that is expecting the apocalypse to come in 1666.  Of course, with the Plague and the Great Fire, it seems like it is.</p>
<p>Waterhouse is a Natural Philosopher, though (or scientist, as we would say).  He goes to Cambridge, where he becomes the room-mate and friend of a hick from the country, one Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>I was reading it at a roaring pace all through the first part, but for me it lagged suddenly when the second part started, and we are introduced to a new set of characters, principally a vagabond called Jack Shaftoe (he has a brother called Bob, but I don&rsquo;t know whether he is meant to be anything to do with the song) and a young woman called Eliza who was a harem slave to the Turks, and whom Jack frees.</p>
<p>The pace picks up again as we get to know these characters, and their peregrinations round the courts and battlefields of Europe mean that their paths eventually cross with Daniel and the other Royal Society members from part one.  Which takes us to part three.</p>
<p>Far too much happens to give even a summary here.  There are the births of princes and the deaths of kings, war, conquest and betrayal.  Almost most importantly of all, the early scientists are probing and extending their understanding of the workings of the universe (of &lsquo;creation&rsquo; as they would term it).</p>
<p>Most importantly of all, there are the lives of ordinary people going on against this backdrop</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fantastic work, and as the first part of a trilogy, it isn&rsquo;t marred by Stephenson&rsquo;s noted difficulty with endings.  I look forward eagerly to reading the second and third volumes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it won SF awards, though: just being written by an SF author really <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> enough to make a book SF.</p></body></html></p>

He falls in love with a fox, who has taken the form of a woman at the time. and who tries to get him to leave the temple with her.   When he is attacked via his dreams, she tries to protect him.</p>
<p>Although presented in the physical form of a modern graphic novel, this is actually a prose short story with full-page (and two-page) illustrations.</p>
<p>It’s very fine, but at the same time, a long way from essential, in my humble opinion.</p>

			 <html><body><p>A collection of some of Neil's shorter comics work. All fine and dandy, but far from essential.  The most interesting one for me was a <cite>Swamp Thing</cite> story for which they had reunited the old art team ('old' in the sense of, from the days when Alan Moore was writing it) of Steve Bissette and John Totleben. So that it looked 'right', even for me, who has always paid much more attention to story than artwork.  I've never bought a comic because of its artists, but often have because of its writer.  That's why it was mainly Alan Moore who brought me back to comics as an adult: he's a great storyteller.
<p>Indeed, I fairly often find myself annoyed or frustrated with sections of comics where the story is told entirely or mainly visually, and for reasons of poor reproduction, or just the artist(s) not being as good as they think they are, it&rsquo;s hard to work out what&rsquo;s supposed to be going on.</p>
<p>That happened to a small extent in one of the stories here, in which Gaiman uses the &lsquo;old&rsquo; Sandman character, who was published by DC long ago, and was in abeyance when he reimagined the character as the Lord of Dreams that we know today.  The old Sandman is a masked adventurer in the intra-war years.  His mask is a gas mask, and his weapon is a gun that fires sleeping gas.</p>
<p>This story is a kind of crossover between the two versions of The Sandman.  The old one has cause to visit the house in England where an old wizard has the Lord of Dreams captured - as at the very start of Gaiman&rsquo;s <cite>Sandman</cite>, in other words.</p>
<p>All in all, reading this was not time wasted, but it wasn&rsquo;t that great.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Well, clearly no blogging happens over the Christmas and New Year period in the Devilgate household. In fact I didn't even switch the computer on.
<p>So we start the year without having done a review of the last one, and without even having posted all of last year&rsquo;s Book Notes. I have nine (nine!) written or partially written, but unposted, mini book reviews, that I&rsquo;ll try to put up over the next few days. Perhaps I should slap them all together into one, but that would really be <em>too</em> big, and would make it harder to find things in future. So Book Notes 2006 entries will keep on appearing for a while yet.</p>
<p>And since I&rsquo;ve made myself a New Year&rsquo;s resolution to write every day, I hope to be making considerably more posts in general than last year. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>Tom Strong is a kind of Doc Savage/Tom Swift figure.  The stories are kind of fifties/sixties futurist styled.  They’re not that good, unfortunately.  In, of course, my humble opinion.  Even the ones written by Moore (there are several other writers) aren’t up to his usual high standards.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Ah, how we love the paranoid fantasies of our Phil.  As does Hollywood, considering how many of his works have been made into films.
<p>Not much chance of that ever happening to this one, mind you (though they&rsquo;ve done <cite>A Scanner Darkly</cite> now, so you never can tell).</p>
<p>This is kind of a prequel or counterpart to <cite>Valis</cite>, which I read a good number of years ago.  In a similar way, Dick himself is one of the central characters, though it is not him who believes that an alien intelligence &ndash; the Vast Active Living Intelligence System &ndash; is communicating with him.</p>
<p>We are in an alternative America: instead of Nixon becoming President in 1968, an even more authoritarian, fascist figure called Ferris F Freemont does.  His regime quickly takes on an extreme McCarthyite nature.</p>
<p>Valis sends a message of hope from beyond the stars.  Or is it from another dimension?  Or is it God?  Nicholas Brady does not know, and neither do we.  A significant portion of the book consists of him and his writer friend, Phil, discussing possibilities for what it could be that contacts him in dreams, and sometimes lends him lifesaving information and even healing powers.  But no real conclusion is reached.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an OK read, but is largely unresolved by the end: though not without hope.</p></body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I finally get to read <em>Vellum</em>, then. I'd been waiting for the paperback for a while, as I said back in <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=36">Book Notes 7</a>. I've pre-ordered the sequel, <em>Ink</em>, in hardback, though, which should be recommendation enough.
<p>We are, once again, in the territory of myths walking the Earth. This time they are angels and demons, gods and devils, and their powers extend far beyond Earth, and into the Vellum. This is a kind of multiverse, a visual metaphor for the many-worlds theory, you might say (though the book walks the fantasy line, more than science fiction, the use of nanotech notwithstanding).</p>
<p>It starts really well, and I loved the whole first half, but the second half loses focus somewhat. The pace slows, and it seems a tad repetitive. Though I may have picked up this last criticism from <a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/books/column/sfw884.html">John Clute&rsquo;s review</a> of it, which I glanced at while I was reading the book.</p>
<p>Reading the whole of Clute&rsquo;s review now, I agree with much of it, though I&rsquo;m left feeling considerably more positive about the book as a whole than Clute obviously was.</p>
<p>In a way it feels unfinished: not just that it leaves you wanting more, which is a good thing, but I found myself thinking, on more than one occasion after it ended, that I hadn&rsquo;t actually finished reading it. However, Hal himself <a href="http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.com/2006/09/nothing-here-go-there.html">points us</a> at <a href="http://bmalone.blogspot.com/2006/09/hal-duncans-vellum-my-strange-thoughts.html">a review</a> which captures the meaning of the ending perfectly, and makes me think I need to read things more closely and think about them more carefully. Though sometimes you just need to have something pointed out to you, to make you realise that you understood it all along.</p>
<p>It is a great, sparkling debut (though whether it is possible for work to be simultaneously a debut and a &lsquo;masterpiece&rsquo;, as the blurb has it, is something that caused some discussion in my house), and highly recommended.</p></body></html></p>

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2006/12/06/book-notes-the-extraordinary-and/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-12-06 15:26:33 &#43;0100">Dec 6, 2006</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Catherine Webb is only 19; she had her first novel published at 14.  It makes you sick; though it shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Horatio Lyle is a scientist and investigator in Victorian times.  He has a dog called Tate, but there’s a lot more to this book than bad sugar-manufacturer-related jokes.  The blurb describes it as “Sherlock Holmes crossed with Thomas Edison as written by Terry Pratchett”, and that’s not a bad assessment; though it’s not as funny as Pratchett.  I read it with my nine-year-old son, and he thoroughly enjoyed it: though not so much the descriptive passages, and he was disappointed by the ending.</p>
<p>I thought the descriptive passages were very well written and incredibly evocative, but there were rather too many of them; and while I enjoyed it at the time, actually the action was on the weak side, and she didn’t make as much of the plot as she could have.</p>
<p>And that ending: what a letdown.  See, the story is that this ancient plate of great cultural significance has been stolen from the Bank of England, and various groups are trying to get it back.</p>
<p>It turns out that one of the groups consists of some sort of supernatural beings.  They are a bit vampirish, but they have the traditional fear of, and vulnerability to, iron, of Faerie.  They believe the plate has great power.</p>
<p>There are investigations and plots; but not really very many of them.  It’s very well written, as I say, but kind of lightweight.</p>
<p>I see that there’s a sequel out already, so in time we might see whether her plotting skills have got any stronger.</p>

			 <html><body><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/this_week/default.stm"><cite>This Week</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcone/">BBC1</a>'s late-night political discussion programme, had a piece last night from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Collins_(soldier)">Colonel Tim Collins</a>, who used to be "Britain's most senior soldier in Iraq". He was saying that Saddam Hussein should hang as soon as possible, and that we should have the death penalty in Britain.
<p>I won&rsquo;t reiterate the many general arguments against the death penalty here, but consider these.  Collins tried to justify the execution of Saddam by citing the brutality of Saddam&rsquo;s regime. The thing is, you don&rsquo;t demonstrate the wrongness of a brutal regime by exercising the most brutal form of punishment. You don&rsquo;t <em>win</em> that way: at best you draw, and who wants to draw with a dictator? You win by showing that you&rsquo;re <em>better</em> than that; by behaving in a civilised way.</p>
<p>He went on to say that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;incoherent&rdquo; that Britain should have nuclear weapons, but not have the option to execute terrorists. I see absolutely no logical connection between the two, and neither did Michael Portillo. Nor could Collins make the connection in a way that made any sense.</p>
<p>Using the death penalty isn&rsquo;t a sign of strength: it&rsquo;s a sign of <em>weakness</em>.  The truly strong can both show mercy, and behave in a way that separates them from the caveman.</body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>This is a very, very strange book.  It's strange in the spacefaring future it describes, but it's probably even stranger linguistically.
<p>I used to read John Clute&rsquo;s book reviews in <a href="http://www.ttapress.com/IZ.html"><cite>Interzone</cite></a>, years ago, when he reviewed there regularly,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> so linguistic strangeness was exactly what I expected when I picked this up.</p>
<p>What I mean by linguistic strangeness is this: you used to have to read his reviews with a good dictionary to hand, and if you were diligent you might learn three new words in even the shortest review.  His erudition was legendary, and he liked to display it.  At first that used to annoy me, because it seemed that he chose willfully obscure words: he appeared to be doing no more than displaying his vocabulary for its own sake.  Showing off, in other words.</p>
<p>But as time went on I grew to appreciate the way he made us stretch, and I moved towards the conclusion that, yes, he had an unfeasibly large vocabulary &ndash; or was unreasonably quick to reach for the thesaurus &ndash; but he did it in order to achieve precision in meaning: why use a word that is nearly right, when there is one that is exactly right? Plus, it was part of his style, his reviewer&rsquo;s voice, if you will.</p>
<p>So to his first SF novel, then.  It is strange.  It is very, very strange.  It&rsquo;s a space opera set in our galaxy a few hundred years in the future.  There are humans and a range of aliens, plus various sentient AIs.  Much is made of the fact that humans smell: they have to keep away from other species, and avoid getting emotional when they do meet others, to keep their pheromone production under control.  No other sentient species suffers from this problem, it seems.  Furthermore, when humans meet each other, it is very unusual &ndash; extremely rude, even &ndash; to make eye contact.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Clute is trying to tell us something about our own society, here, but it seems to me that, with the state of technology on display, something would have been done about the smell, if it was really that much of a problem.  The eye-contact thing is just bizarre.  Maybe (since they exist in a state of close integrations with their computers, intelligent and not) it&rsquo;s a reference to the lack of direct personal contact that we get from our present interactions on the net.</p>
<p>Those are relatively minor matters, though: what of the story?</p>
<p>Our hero is Freer, who is a free trader, with his own ship, the <em>Tile Dance</em>.  It is staffed solely by him and run by a sentient pair of artificial Minds: KathKirt.  All AIs are bipartite; they manifest through Masks, which are said to &lsquo;face&rsquo; &lsquo;Jack&rsquo; or &lsquo;Flyte&rsquo;.   I still don&rsquo;t understand what these are supposed to mean.  Did I mention that it&rsquo;s a strange book?</p>
<p>The galaxy is in danger from something called plaque, which appears to be a kind of plague causing a dementia-like effect in artificial Minds (and maybe in biological ones, too; that wasn&rsquo;t clear).  As things develop, it turns out that a passenger that Freer Has taken aboard knows the route to a legendary planet which is the source of &lsquo;Lenses&rsquo;, the only thing that can cure the data plague.</p>
<p>They have to run from the forces of the Insort Geront, who want to stop them getting the Lenses.  These are spacefaring luddites, in the form of multi-bodied (or at least multi-headed) quadrupeds (possibly) who are constantly eating live prey, including the younger members of their own families.</p>
<p>On the way they dock at an artificial moon, which turns out to be a legendary lost world.  Or something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an awful lot going on in this book, and I can&rsquo;t honestly say that I understood all of it. But it&rsquo;s a fascinating read in many ways, and is worth the effort.  Recommended.</p></body></html></p>

			<h1><a href="https://devilgate.org/2006/11/01/book-notes-viriconium-by-m/">Book Notes 14: Viriconium, by M John Harrison</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2006/11/01/book-notes-viriconium-by-m/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-11-01 18:43:38 &#43;0100">Nov 1, 2006</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>This is a reissue in the Fantasy Masterworks series, of all - or nearly all - of Harrison's 'Viriconium' stories. Four of the collected works are novels (though short ones) and the rest short stories. I had read only one of them before, the last-written and last presented here: 'A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium' appeared in <cite>Interzone</cite> a long time ago. I don't think I understood it then, though: it doesn't really make much sense out of context.
<p>Though as it happens, the context of that one story is different from that of all the others. The others are all set in Viriconium, or in the lands that surround it. This final one is set in our world; it tells the tale of some people who dream of Viriconium, who believe that it is real, who believe that they might be able to reach it one day.</p>
<p>Whether anyone would actually <em>want</em> to get to Viriconium if they could is another matter. It is a sort of dream city at the end of time. It has a constant feeling that the world has run down, that time is running out. Humanity has fallen from the great technological highs of the &lsquo;Afternoon Cultures&rsquo;, and now survives on scavenged technology - machines so advanced that they are still running after millennia - and on traditional crafts.</p>
<p>So most of the weaponry, for example, consists of swords, but there are a few prized energy blades, or <em>baans</em>. People travel on horseback, or walk, to get around, especially after the last few aircars are destroyed in the War of the Two Queens, which is part of the subject matter of &lsquo;The Pastel City&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Did I mention that this doesn&rsquo;t belong in the <em>Fantasy</em> Masterworks line? Just because people fight with swords, and the technology is advanced beyond their understanding into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws">Clarke&rsquo;s (Third) Law</a> territory, doesn&rsquo;t make a book sword &amp; sorcery. This is science fiction, where the science is breaking down; or at least, the knowledge of it is.</p>
<p>Despite all the stories having been published before, there are copyright dates for only a few of them, and previous-publication details for none. Which to my mind detracts slightly from the collection.</p>
<p>Also, the first story is listed as &lsquo;Viriconium Knights&rsquo; in the contents and on its own title page, but as Viriconium Nights&quot; (which is the title I recall having heard of before) on the copyright page. This could, of course, be deliberate, as I have a vague recollection of having heard that this is not a simple collection and republication, but that there has also been some reworking.</p>
<p>It is not easy reading: it is a 500-page book, and it took me over a month to read it. Now, I&rsquo;m not that fast a reader these days, but that is <em>slow</em>. But at no point was I thinking, &ldquo;This is heavy going,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be bothered with this.&rdquo; Rather, it&rsquo;s just that some prose styles are denser than others, and Harrison&rsquo;s is <em>dense</em>. In a good way. Highly recommended.</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>To Glasgow, then, and a weekend visit to my Mum.  The kids and I caught the train to Stansted on Friday afternoon, to find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theatre">security theatre</a> in full force.  Although we made EasyJet's last checkin time with a good ten minutes to spare, I really thought we would miss our flight when we joined the back of one of two or three giant, slow-moving queues.  Especially so when, after a few minutes, we realised that we were in fact at the back of a  queue for another checkin desk.  We weren't alone in this error, though: the queues mingled, and quite a few others had made the same mistake.
<p>But in the end it wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> bad.  The queue began moving fairly quickly &ndash; or smoothly, at least &ndash; and while it was frustrating, it was bearable, as long as you didn&rsquo;t let yourself <em>get</em> frustrated.  The passport/boarding-pass-control desk looked a right mess, though, covered as it was by abandoned bottles, cosmetics containers and what have you.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m not actually sure why the queues were so long.  The only things that have changed in security terms compared with a few months ago are the prohibited items in hand baggage, and the enforcement of the &ldquo;only one item&rdquo; rule (I&rsquo;m sure this has been the rule for decades, but it just wasn&rsquo;t strictly enforced).  Both of those issues should be dealt with at checkin, so when you get to the security gates you should be ready.  Every bag and coat is x-rayed, as before: but there should be fewer bags; everyone goes through a metal detector, just as they always did.  There was a &ldquo;please take off your shoes&rdquo; section after the metal detectors, but as we paused at it, one security guy called, &ldquo;Not everybody, not everybody,&rdquo; and waved us on.  I suppose people were randomly chosen, and incidentally, everyone I saw taking their shoes off was white.  This may, of course, just mean that people who look like terrorists (whatever that may mean) are not travelling, from fear of being hassled.</p>
<p>I conclude that the only reason for the giant queues must be stupidity: there must be people who, even though they are asked about prohibited items at checkin, and even though this stuff has been in the news for weeks, still have drinks in their hand luggage, and then have to stop to abandon them at security.  Or who try to take more than one item on, even though they&rsquo;ve been told not to.  And yet, I didn&rsquo;t see much of that happening.  I really don&rsquo;t understand why the queues got so big.  There were plenty of security staff on duty, too.</p>
<p>Coming back, things were much less fraught at Glasgow Airport, as they generally are at smaller airports, in my experience.</p>
<p>Throughout, I have to say, all the security staff we encountered were cheerful, polite, and helpful, while doing a largely thankless, probably quite dull, job, filled with seemingly-arbitrary rule changes handed down from above.  I can&rsquo;t really fault them, no matter how daft some of the things they have to enforce may be.</p>
<p>A last thought: we are being conditioned to accept travelling with photo ID, even within the country.  It was strange to see everyone queuing up to get onto a flight to Scotland, with their passports ready.  Now I&rsquo;d be quite happy to see EU passports issued by the Republic of Scotland (as long as it <em>was</em> a republic), but for now, it was still a journey within the UK.</p>
<p>And the strange thing is, it seems to be the <em>airlines</em> that are driving this, not the authorities.  I have had to show photo ID on RyanAir and EasyJet, but a few months ago &ndash; this year, certainly &ndash; I flew to Scotland with BMI Baby, and not only did they not ask for ID, but I didn&rsquo;t even have to see a human to check in: hand baggage, a credit card, and a self-checkin machine, and there I was.  That was before all the recent fuss, true, but RyanAir (and possibly EasyJet) have been asking for ID for years.  Are they secretly being used by the government to get us used to carrying ID cards?  And if so, why is it only some airlines?</p>
<p>Or am I being unreasonably paranoid?  &lsquo;Cos I only want to be <em>reasonably</em> paranoid, you know.</p></body></html></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>So here I am, all ready to write about my day for the <a href="http://www.historymatters.org.uk/output/page1.asp">History Matters - Pass It On</a> site's <a href="http://www.historymatters.org.uk/output/Page96.asp%22">One Day in History</a> project, which has been much hyped of late.  But before I started writing I took a look at the <a href="http://www.historymatters.org.uk/output/page66.asp">terms and conditions</a>, where I found this little thought:
</p><blockquote>
  You agree, by submitting such material, to grant the Partners jointly and severally a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, play, make available to the public,
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair enough, right?  You&rsquo;re granting them a non-exclusive licence to use the material.  But it goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
  and exercise all copyright and publicity rights with respect to, your material worldwide and/or to incorporate your material in other works in any media now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in your material.
</blockquote>
<p>Umm, &ldquo;exercise all copyright&rdquo;?  Now I&rsquo;m not so sure.  Let&rsquo;s see what else there is.</p>
<blockquote>
  you waive any moral rights to your material for the purposes of its submission to and publication on the Site or for the general purposes specified above.
</blockquote>
<p>Ouch.  I don&rsquo;t like the sound of that.  Now the thing that got me looking at this was this, which is not in the Ts&amp;Cs, but right on the <a href="http://www.historymatters.org.uk/output/page97.asp">submission page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  The History Matters partners own the copyright of any materials that you submit and be free to use them in any History Matter related materials such as any media stories, published books etc.
</blockquote>
<p>Not just overbearingly copywrong, but ungrammatical, too.  Ouchy, ouchy, ouch, ouch!</p>
<p>Then, as if to add stupidity to a lack of concern for people&rsquo;s work, there is a section entitled, &ldquo;Links to this Website.&rdquo; It includes the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
  The Partners reserve the right at their discretion to prohibit any link from another Internet site or equivalent entity to materials or information on the Site.
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so they&rsquo;re not <em>banning</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_link">deep links</a>, they&rsquo;re just warning you that they <em>might</em> do so.</p>
<blockquote>
  Furthermore, no page or pages from this website may be framed by or with any third party content or otherwise made available to the public in conjunction with any third party content without the prior written consent of the Partners
</blockquote>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all right to take thousands of random contributors' work away from them, but we can&rsquo;t in turn reproduce or reuse <em>your</em> work (or that of the random contributors)?</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon, guys, this is the <em>web</em>: linking is what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>And as to copyright: The History Matters project is founded, according to its <a href="http://www.historymatters.org.uk/output/Page46.asp">FAQ</a>, by:</p>
<blockquote>
  <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk" target="_blank">National Trust</a>, <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/" target="_blank">English Heritage</a>, <a href="http://www.hlf.org.uk/nhmfweb/aboutthenhmf" target="_blank">The National Heritage Memorial Fund</a> and <a href="http://www.hlf.org.uk" target="_blank">Heritage Lottery Fund</a>, the <a href="http://www.hha.org.uk" target="_blank">Historic Houses Association</a>, <a href="http://www.heritagelink.org.uk" target="_blank">Heritage Link</a>, the <a href="http://www.civictrust.org.uk" target="_blank">Civic Trust</a>, the <a href="http://www.britarch.ac.uk" target="_blank">Council for British Archaeology</a> and <a href="http://www.spab.org.uk/" target="_blank">Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings</a>
</blockquote>
<p>All publicly-funded and/or charitable bodies, if I&rsquo;m not very much mistaken.</p>
<p>Now you may think that I&rsquo;m being unreasonably cautious about this.  I&rsquo;m just some guy in London writing about his day.  It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re <em>stealing</em> what I write, or as if what I write matters that much in the grand scheme of things.  And that&rsquo;s true enough.  I have absolutely no problem with them using what I might write.  Indeed, all my writing here is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">Creative-Commons-licensed</a>, so you don&rsquo;t even have to ask if you want to use it.  The problem is this: if you follow the letter of the agreement, then <em>I</em> lose all rights over what I submit to them.  That means that if I write a description of my day, submit it to the project, and then post a copy here, on my blog (as I intended to do), then I&rsquo;ll be in breach of copyright.</p>
<p>And that is madness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving them the benefit of the doubt: I&rsquo;m working on the assumption that this is just carelessness; that the terms and conditions are just poorly thought through, rather than deliberately evil.  But really, someone there has a duty to take care.  When you&rsquo;re a public body soliciting material created by the public, you have no moral right to claim the exclusive intellectual rights over that material.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><h2>In which I make a CD compilation, and blow whatever vestiges of my credibility remained</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a bit invisible on here for a while.  First I had two weeks camping in France, during which (among much else) I managed to grow a beard (not that I was particularly trying to: it just kind of happened).  In the first couple of weeks after getting back I spent much of my free time on preparing a CD for a special occasion.</p>
<p>The occasion was the golden wedding anniversary of my beloved&rsquo;s parents.  They had asked me to provide some music for after the dinner.  The brief was to get the grandkids dancing.  The theme we chose was to cover all the decades from 1956 to 2006.</p>
<p>Now, strange as it may seem, I&rsquo;ve never actually made a compilation CD before, despite having had the technology to do so for several years.  I was never really very big on making compilation tapes, either.  So the first thing to do was to check that the technology worked.</p>
<p>Our CD writer hasn&rsquo;t written under Windows since we got Dell to replace the whole drive when it broke down.  It&rsquo;s doubtless some kind of driver problem, but I haven&rsquo;t bothered to try to fix it.  I know what you&rsquo;re thinking: CD writers are as cheap as potatoes these days; but never buy a new one when there&rsquo;s a way to get the old one working, I say.  The logical solution, then, was to use Linux, where the same drive does work; and which is my preferred working environment anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently using the <a href="http://kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a> distribution, and as it is <a href="http://kde.org/">KDE</a> based, the logical CD creation tool seems to be <a href="http://www.k3b.org/">K3B</a>.  This is essentially a graphical front end to various command-line tools, which is a fine approach.  Unfortunately the GUI is a bit clunky.  Still, nothing I couldn&rsquo;t live with (once I had dowloaded and installed the plugin that allows it to recognise MP3s, at least).</p>
<p>So the next thing was to consider how to get the tracks we wanted.  We already had quite a lot, of course, but inevitably there were plenty that we wanted that we didn&rsquo;t have.  I  briefly considered the iTunes Music Store, but rejected it because a) I was using Linux, so couldn&rsquo;t use iTunes; b) my MP3 player is not an iPod, so it (ITMS) would have been little use to me after this project; and c) most importantly of all, I didn&rsquo;t want to have to struggle with DRM(Digital Restrictions Management, thought they&rsquo;d like you to believe it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rights&rdquo;.).</p>
<p>I already use <a href="http://emusic.com">eMusic</a>, which is good for relatively recent, independent stuff, but is not really a source of classic tracks.  I did get &lsquo;Rock Around the Clock&rsquo; from there, though.  As well as that, Frances bought a couple of new CDs: a Paul Simon collection and a disco compilation.</p>
<p>But for the rest, and for the maximum flexibility, there was only one solution: I would have to enter the murky grey-area waters of <a href="http://allofmp3.com">AllOfMP3.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t come across this site, it&rsquo;s based in Russia and a legal grey area.  The people who run it claim to be following the copyright laws of Russia; and presumably that is true, because the site continues to operate.  However, they are able to offer a vast collection of albums for mere pennies per track.  And all in a selection of formats, and without DRM.</p>
<p>The grey area is that we may be breaking the law by using their services in other countries, such as the UK.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still running, though, so let&rsquo;s work on the assumption that it&rsquo;s OK to use it.</p>
<p>I set up an AllOfMP3 account, and by a daft number of steps of indirection, got some money into it, and downloaded a few tracks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good stuff: they have a <em>huge</em> selection of tracks, and the prices are so cheap.  I think it has something to teach iTunes and the other legal download sites: the less you charge (and the less encumbered the files) the more people will buy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there was a track, or at least an artist, that I couldn&rsquo;t find on it.</p>
<p>Oh, OK, there were two, but they&rsquo;re both a tad embarassing.  We got a late request for the following tracks: &lsquo;Summer Holiday&rsquo;; &lsquo;Y Viva España&rsquo;; and &lsquo;Remember You&rsquo;re A Womble&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Yes, I know.  But since novelty hits (and songs from kids' TV shows) were by no means outwith the scope of the project (and since we aleady had both &lsquo;Crazy Frog&rsquo; and the <cite>Bratz</cite> TV theme), I attempted to comply.</p>
<p>Which was harder than you might have expected.  AllOfMP3 had the first, but the second was slightly harder.  I did find it, though, squirreled away on <a href="http://dalstonoxfamshop.blogspot.com/">somebody&rsquo;s MP3 blog</a> (which seems to mainly consist of tracks ripped from old tapes found in the Dalston branch of Oxfam: the ripper/blogger is practically a neighbour).</p>
<p>Those Wombles, though: they&rsquo;re hard to find.</p>
<p>There is a strange  class of sites out there that list the contents of albums, and appear to allow you to click through and buy the the tracks; but when you do, you get a screen saying, &ldquo;That track is not available&rdquo;, or &ldquo;This album is not available&rdquo;.  Which makes me wonder why they bother to list it on their sites; or at least, why they list it with live links that make it look as if you can buy it.</p>
<p>Anyway, somewhere on the deeper, darker recesses of the net, on the very last page of sites that, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22remember+you're+a+Womble%22">as far as Google knew</a>, contained the string, &ldquo;remember you&rsquo;re a Womble&rdquo;, I found it.  Or at least part of it: it ends very abruptly.  But in the context of the compilation, that didn&rsquo;t actually seem to matter too much.</p>
<p>The party was a great success.  The music went down very well, with only one slight problem: we overran our time in the hotel&rsquo;s function suite, and never got to play the second disk.  Too much eating, not enough dancing, I suppose.</p>
<p>Still, now that I&rsquo;ve done one, making other compilation CDs should be a doddle.</p>
<p>Oh, and the beard (I mentioned it earlier, you weren&rsquo;t paying attention) came off before the party.  The kids complained, but some things just have to go.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This, you won't be surprised to hear, was a re-reading.  I started out reading it to my nine-year-old son.  He, of course, soon zoomed ahead on his own, leaving me to finish more slowly.  I think that makes it three times for him. Definitely just the two for me.  And he's read it at least once more between me first drafting this post and finally getting round to publishing it.
<p>So, how is it?  In particular, how does it hold up to a re-reading?  The short answers are &ldquo;great&rdquo; and &ldquo;really well&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for Rowling&rsquo;s work, an unashamed big fan.  And obviously, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been reading it again if I hadn&rsquo;t liked it the first time.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it&rsquo;s great.  Probably not the best of the series (though I&rsquo;m not sure I could say what that is), but not the worst, either.</p>
<p>I have a view on the major plot spoiler, but I won&rsquo;t go into that here.  Suffice to say that I&rsquo;m largely convinced by the arguments of <a href="http://DumbledoreIsNotDead.com">the site whose very domain name is a spoiler</a> (though I see that it has changed its name, now).</p>
<p>What with Harry Potter, the Lemony Snicket books, the Artemis Fowl books and others, we are truly living through a golden age of children&rsquo;s literature (or at least, publishing).</p>
<p>I was surprised, when I asked my son whether he was more eagerly awaiting &ldquo;Seven or Thirteen,&rdquo; that he said, &ldquo;Thirteen.&rdquo;  Perhaps he sensed that Mr Snicket would be finished before Ms Rowling; and it turns out that he was right: the final adventure of the unfortunate Baudelaire orphans is coming out next month (on Friday the thirteenth, suitably enough.</p>

			 <html><body><h5>This Knife of Sheffield Steel</h5>
<p>When you grow up in Scotland (or at least, when I did so during the sixties and seventies) you pick up a fair amount of anti-English feeling.  It’s mainly to do with football, but it is linked to what is seen as several hundred years of oppression.  Although the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Union_1707">Act of Union</a> was, in theory, a mutual act between two independent nations, it is clear which was the dominant partner.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in England — in London — for nineteen years, though, and am unlikely to leave (or not to go back to Scotland at any rate: if I left London it would be to escape the UK’s ubiquitous surveillance state  and paranoid anti-terror laws).  It should be obvious, then, that I harbour no great dislike of England or its people.  Indeed, to harbour such a collective dislike for fifty-odd million would be bigotry of the most ludicrous sort.</p>
<p>However, I have long been bothered by the apparent inability of many English people to distinguish their country’s identifying features from those of the larger nation-state of which it is part.  And I’m further disappointed by what seems to be a similar difficulty that many of Dave’s <a href="http://davehill.typepad.com/temperama/big_england/index.html">Big England</a> guests have had: finding things to love that are uniquely and explicitly English.</p>
<p>As I discussed with <a href="http://lightandbitter.blogspot.com/">Roldy</a> on <a href="http://davehill.typepad.com/temperama/2006/08/big_england_no2.html">his Big England piece</a>, so many of the the things that people have chosen are not English — not uniquely so, at least.  Though many of them are uniquely British.</p>
<h5>On A Catwalk Jungle</h5>
<p>John Lennon was sadly mistaken when he sang “The English army had just won the war” — and not just because he was ignoring the contributions of Canadians, Poles, the Free French, and of course, the USA.</p>
<p>That is poetic licence,  and it would be churlish of me to complain.  But it is perhaps the most famous example of the casual use of “England”, when the speaker or writer really means one or other of “Great Britain”, “The United Kingdom”, or even “The British Isles”.</p>
<p>Some would say that it doesn’t matter.  However, I believe it is always worth taking care with language, to try to say precisely what you mean: how else are others to understand you?  Also, it’s bloody annoying to us Scots (and probably to the Welsh and Northern Irish, too).  Maybe that’s why they do it, of course.</p>
<h5>Where the Well-known Flag of England Flies</h5>
<p>It used to be that the English also seemed confused about which country they meant at football matches.  All through my childhood and well into my twenties I wondered why English football fans supported their country using an emblem that contained representations of two other countries as well as their own.  I’m speaking of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Flag">Union Flag</a>, of course.  Stadiums used to be draped in it, even when England were playing Scotland in the old Home Internationals (just as an aside: can you think of another country which has such a tautologically-named event?)</p>
<p>What did they think the blue part with the white cross represented, I used to wonder?</p>
<p>In recent years, though, football fans at least seem to have worked out which country’s flag they want to fly.  Which brings us back to why Dave started this whole thing.</p>
<h5>Land of One Thousand Stances</h5>
<p>I guess I like England; but it took me a long time to realise that I don’t have to like it in <em>opposition</em> to anything, particularly Scotland: I can (and do) love London, and still love Edinburgh.</p>
<p>London is something of a special case, though.  While it is undoubtedly <em>in</em> England, there is a sense in which it is not <em>of</em> it: it is not really part of England, or of any country.  Perhaps all great “world cities” are like that.  The old song goes, “Maybe it’s because I’m a Londoner,” not, “Maybe it’s because I’m English and London is the capital city of my country”.</p>
<p>So where does all that leave me?  In a word, I think, ambivalent.  All the things that I might list that I like about this country, I don’t see as uniquely English (except by geography), but rather as British: music, literature, scenery, beer, the BBC…</p>
<p>Maybe the thing to do is turn it on its head.  While I would claim  The Beatles or The Clash as “British bands”, rather than “English bands”, I would claim Iain Banks or Irving Welsh, say, as “Scottish writers”.  So maybe I’m being unfair to England.</p>
<p>But then, I’m in the oppressed minority.</p>
<p>And cricket’s still the most boring thing imaginable.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>The last of my three recent graphic borrowings from the library, and the one I expected to like most.  But it's a bit lightweight for Gaiman's work, and for my taste.
<p>It&rsquo;s based on work that Gaiman did with Alice Cooper for a concept album that the latter released in 1994.  I didn&rsquo;t know that people still made concept albums, but there you go.</p>
<p>Also there is one theme in particular that Gaiman was to revisit in <cite>American Gods</cite>; namely that of the town where children disappear periodically.  In <cite>American Gods</cite> the periodic disappearance (and murder, let&rsquo;s face it) of the child acts a kind of spell, which protects a town from the encroachment of the rest of the world and the forces of modernity and &lsquo;development&rsquo;.  In this work, there&rsquo;s no suggestion that the children&rsquo;s absorption into the &lsquo;Theater of the Real&rsquo; brings advantage to anyone other than the the semi-mythical &lsquo;Showman&rsquo;.  Gaiman was perhaps using this work to develop some of the ideas that he would return to later.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that, of course, but as I say, the work as a whole seems shallow and perhaps incomplete, compared to, say, <cite>The Sandman</cite>.</p></p>

			 <html><body><p>I've been thinking that I should write about the state of things between Lebanon and Israel, as it is the most profoundly dangerous ongoing event in the world at the moment. But I would have found it hard to express what I wanted to say without coming over as anti-Israel, and so running the risk of being called anti-semitic.
<p>In fact I&rsquo;m opposed to the actions of both sides, where the &lsquo;sides&rsquo; are defined as the Israeli government and Hezbollah. And it is the innocent civilians of both nations who suffer.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out that <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> has already written a <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/01/Bad-Craziness">better post</a> about this than I could have, expressing pretty much everything I wanted to say:</p>
</p><blockquote>
  Once again: <strong>Military violence against civilians is wrong</strong>, and if you have an argument that convinces you it's right, your argument is broken.</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
  Those leaders, though... anyone who's read first-hand reportage about the Hez leadership knows they're bloodthirsty racist fundamentalist barbarians who would really like to kill all the Jews and revert the world to fourteenth-century ways. Scum.\
As for the Israeli political leadership, we have to act on the assumption that they actually kind of understand what's going on around them, and that they launched this in full knowledge that they intended to kill hundreds, displace hundreds of thousands, and break a country. And there's a sickening suspicion that they knew it wouldn't work, that this is all playing to the domestic political theater; which would be getting into Milošević territory. Scum.</blockquote>

			 <html><body><p>The local library is proving a great source of graphic fiction at the moment.  Another early-early Moore, one of which I had heard, but had definitely not read.</p>
<p>It is Moore’s interpretation of a theme that was then very common, the alien lost on Earth.  It wears its debt to <cite>ET</cite> quite openly: one of the characters even referring to the film for inspiration in how to deal with the alien.</p>
<p>That said, it’s entirely possible that Moore developed it without prior knowledge of the film: it wasn’t a new idea when <cite>ET</cite> used it.</p>
<p><cite>Skizz</cite> is a gentle, heartwarming tale of respect between intelligent beings, regardless of difference.  A human girl meets the “other”, and finds he is not so “other” at all.</p>
<p>And it has a genuinely nasty and scary baddie, and reconciliation between generations.  Highly recommended.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I found this in the local library, having never heard of it before.  It is a relatively recently-published (2000) collection containing some of his short fiction, some essays, and some interviews he did with people as diverse as Isaac Asimov and Woody Allen.</p>
<p>The title is, of course, a reference to his famous novel <cite>The Demolished Man</cite>, and appears to have been chosen mainly because the ‘deleted’ prologue to that novel is included here.</p>
<p>The non-fiction is interesting, not least in showing part of what Bester did for a living after he  more-or-less dropped out of SF for a long time (he made most of his money by writing for TV).</p>
<p>The fiction, on the whole, is slightly disappointing.  I enjoyed it well enough, but it hasn’t aged well: most of it reads as quite dated.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find that one of the stories was the one which taught me the meaning of the word “fugue” (both musical and psychological) many years ago.  I recalled that I had learned it from a story, but not what story it was: ‘The Four-Hour Fugue’.  Who said SF wasn’t educational?</p>

			 <html><body><p>I found this in the local library.  I thought I hadn’t read it, but I remember reading the ‘Something something, oranges something’ episode (AKA ‘DR and Quinch go to Hollywood’) back when I was at university in the 80s.  I expect they were reprinted by one of the American companies (possibly coloured in?) and I got some of them.</p>
<p>This is early-early Alan Moore, and of course is nowhere near the quality of his later-early work such as <cite>V for Vendetta</cite> or <cite>Watchmen</cite>, or his more recent work like <cite>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</cite>, but it’s quite fun.</p>
<p>As a parent of young kids, though, I now see it as surprisingly violent.  Not that I’d censor it, or anything: just that it’s something I’m more aware of.  Or aware of in a different way.  Back when I was a student I’d probably have celebrated the violence for its wild- and cartoon-ness.</p>
<p>Indeed, I discovered that the book used — presumably coined — the term ‘napalm dispenser’, which I borrowed for a round-robin work that I was involved in back in my university days, and which had hilarious, and nearly calamitous results.  I should probably write a blog post about that one day.  It involved cucumbers.</p>

<p>The newer name is pretty good too, mind.</p>
<p>Afterwards I walked across Southwark Bridge and to Waterloo along the South Bank.  London sparkled as it sweltered.</p>
<p>In other news, Kristin Hersh of Throwing Muses has posted a lovely piece in her blog, <a href="http://www.throwingmusic.com/blog/">ThrowingMusic</a>, about <a href="http://www.throwingmusic.com/blog/2006/07/happy-birthday-ryder.html">her son’s birthday</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>  I met a toddler named Ryder in the airport last night, of all things. Then I came home to a six foot man named Ryder that I call my son. Crazy how the past keeps walking out the door and not even saying goodbye. It colors our present images to an extent that allows us to believe it’s real, but it isn’t. It’s gone. Pioneertown is burning. Today is the anniversary of my stepfather, Wayne’s, death. How can Baby Ry, Pioneertown and Wayne be nowhere?  </blockquote>

			 <html><body><p>Well, Saturday the 1st of July, 2006 will go down in my personal history as something of a special day. First I manage to end up actually feeling sorry for the England football team (except for the idiot Wayne Rooney) — or more for their supporters, really, in the form of my kids.  Then Russell T Davies and the BBC give us the glory that is ‘<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2006/armyofghosts.shtml">Army of Ghosts</a>’.  Warning: spoilers follow.<br>
<br>
<a id="more-38"></a><br>
At last.  At long, long last, Daleks and Cybermen together (and doubtless against each other).  I remember long ago in my university days, my friend Andrew (who co-edited <cite><a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/misc/novascotia.htm">Nova Scotia</a></cite>, as I was <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=36">saying the other day</a>) putting forth the proposition that there should be a Dalek-Cyber war.  It being inevitable that two races each so destructive and inimical to other life forms, should fight if they ever met.</p>
<p>And maybe that’s what’s going to get them out of this one: somehow or other the Doctor’s going to have to use one set of baddies against the other.</p>
<p>But what of Rose?  How can she be saying,”This is how I died”?  I wouldn’t be surprised if she got trapped on the alternative Earth, but that’s not exactly death.  Could she end up trapped in the Void craft (and in the Void)?  The beach at the beginning could be virtual reality.  But even that wouldn’t exactly be death, and it couldn’t provide any way that she could be telling her story.</p>
<p>The only thing that could make anything like sense, as far as I can see, is if she was telling her story knowing that she was about to die.  But I don’t really see how they could get to that state of affairs in the forty-five minutes remaining of the series.</p>
<p>Still, all this speculation will look pretty stupid by this time next week, I suppose, as the <a href="http://forum.digitalspy.co.uk/board/showthread.php?t=408175">speculation about “Army of Ghosts”</a> does now.</p>
<p>My son was <em>crying</em> with emotion  when the Daleks flew out of the sphere.  We had, of course, seen the Dalek blast in the trailer, and he had said,”I think there’ll be Daleks in it.” While I said, “No, it’ll be Dalek technology that Torchwood have scavenged, and maybe even needed the Doctor’s help to get it working.”  But how right he was.</p>
<p>We should have seen it coming, of course.  When the Doctor said, “There’s a storm  coming,” it was obviously an allusion to “The Oncoming Storm”, his supposed nickname amongst the Daleks.  So what could his oncoming storm be?  And then when he said that you could survive the end of the Universe inside a Void craft, it should have leapt out at us as an obvious place to survive the Time War.</p>
<p>But I thought I had heard that there weren’t going to be any Daleks in this series.  In fact, I though that Russell T Davies himself had said that.  If so, then it was a great piece of misdirection — of lying, let’s face it — and I don’t hold it against him for a moment.  At last we got a properly non-trailed, non-spoilered surpise baddy arrival: the best since the Cybermen’s appearance at the end of the first episode of “Earthshock”.  Almost as good as the Dalek’s appearance in “Dalek” could have been, if the episode had been called something else and they hadn’t trailed it.</p>
<p>Only one more week: what’ll we do without it after that?  <em>And</em> <cite>The West Wing</cite> ends the week after that.  Bah.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>I am somewhat mystified by the talk recently about what team Scottish people, and various MPs, particularly Scottish ones, “should” support in the football World Cup.  There are no “should”s, of course: anyone can support any football team they want to, or none.  It’s just daft, at best, that anyone made an issue of it regarding the behaviour of our public servants.</p>
<p>But the stranger thing, really, is that anyone might expect a Scotland fan  to support England under any circumstances.</p>
<p>I don’t mean here, a Scot who takes little interest in football between World Cups, but might enjoy watching some of what should be the best examples of the game.  I’m talking about your actual, dedicated football fan.  Some people suggest that such a Scotland fan ought to support England because we are neighbouring countries, and part of the same meta-country.</p>
<p>But consider this: Spurs and Arsenal are neighbouring teams, and part of the same city; the same can be said of Liverpool and Everton, Manchesters United and City, and perhaps most significantly, of Celtic and Rangers.  Now, tell me this: if Spurs were in the European Cup (as I still think of it) , would an Arsenal fan support them?  Would anyone say that an Arsenal fan “should” support Spurs?</p>
<p>Well, I can’t speak for any of the English teams I mentioned above, but I come from a family of Celtic fans, and was quite a dedicated fan myself in my younger years (before I grew out of the whole thing, and put my interest into music instead), and I can tell you that there is no way on this Earth or beyond that a Celtic fan would ever support Rangers in <em>anything</em>.  <a href="/blog/2006/06/26/supporters/">My Dad’s saying</a> about it not mattering who wins, only had a tangential application to the national teams.  Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_form">Platonic form</a> was, “It doesn’t matter who wins, as long as it’s not Rangers.”</p>
<p>I’m quite sure that Rangers fans feel just as strongly about Celtic’s successes.</p>
<p>The logical extension of this interclub rivalry is to the national teams of Scotland and England; and no doubt, to those of various other pairs of nations.  I imagine that French fans are unlikely to support, say, Germany against Brazil, just because they share a land border with one, and only a planet with the other.</p>
<p>So really, expecting a Scot to support England is crazy.  Supporting the opponent of your greatest rival is perfectly natural behaviour</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>(I haven’t stopped reading, nor writing these notes: I just haven’t got round to posting them, for various reasons).</p>
<p>I actually <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/28474.html">started reading this</a> back in October last year, but, it being a collection of short stories, I took it slowly, over months.  Since I finished it this year, it belongs in my 2006 Book Notes.</p>
<p>Before I get much further I should declare an interest: one of the editors, Andrew, is an old university friend of mine.</p>
<p>So it might come as no surprise that I am more impressed by the very <em>existence</em> of this boook than by its content.  Which is not to dismiss or belittle the content.  There are some very good stories here, by some top authors and fine newcomers.  But the overall sense of it is less than overwhelming.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising letdown is a sin of omission: where is Scotland’s most famous SF author; indeed, probably its most famous living author?  No doubt the good Mr <a href="http://www.iainbanks.net/">Banks</a> has other things to do — I doubt that he writes short stories at all, these days — but you’d think he could have done an introduction or something.</p>
<p>The introduction in fact is by David Pringle, the former editor of <cite><a href="http://www.ttapress.com/IZ.html">Interzone</a></cite>: I had no idea that he was even Scottish.  But there you go: we get everywhere.</p>
<p>I’m not going to go through all the stories, just hit a few high and low points.</p>
<p>In a way the most disappointing story is <a href="http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.com/">Hal Duncan</a>‘s ‘The Last Shift’.  Not because it’s badly written or anything.  Rather, because it’s not SF, fantasy, or speculative in any way.  It’s a sadly-commonplace tale of the last day of a factory whose company is “outsourcing” or “offshoring” all the work.  The fact that the characters all have wings and horns like the demons of our world’s mythology (and that the location doesn’t exist in our world) neither adds anything to it nor detracts from it in anyway: those factors are just irrelevant.</p>
<p>Which is a shame.  I’m a keen reader of Hal’s blog, and look forward to reading his first novel, <cite>Vellum</cite> (I’m ashamed to admit that I’ve so far been put off buying it by the price: it’s a full-price hardback at £17:99, and that just seems a bit too much for an essentially unkown author).</p>
<p>The high points for me  are probably ‘Sophie and the Sacred Fluids’ by <a href="http://scepticpsychic.blogspot.com/">Andrew C Ferguson</a> (another disclaimer: I also had a passing acquaintance with this Andrew);  ‘Deus ex Homine’, by <a href="http://tomorrowelephant.net/">Hannu Rajaniemi</a>; and ‘Snowball’s Chance’, by <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static">Charles Stross</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I’m very glad it exists, and I’m glad I read it; but I hope the next volume, if it happens, is better.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Or at least a container for it.   It’s <a href="http://www.bikeweek.org.uk/">Bike Week</a> this week, and as I happened to be cycling through Islington anyway, I was caught up by the members of the local <a href="http://www.lcc.org.uk/"><abbr title="London Cycling Campaign">LCC</abbr></a>.  They were offering a free cyclists’ breakfast, and a Dr Bike clinic.  I had already had breakfast, and my bike was serviced recently, so I didn’t stop for that (though it is making a strange noise again, so perhaps I should have).</p>
<p>However they were also handing out free water bottles, which is just what I needed: I just noticed this morning that mine is cracked, and in any case it’s very prone to making the water taste plasticy.  So I accepted that gratefully, and am giving something back by adding what tiny amount of Google juice I can to the URL that is printed on the bottle: Islington Borough’s <a href="http://www.islington.gov.uk/Transport/GreenTravel/">Green Travel</a> page.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I found myself feeling curiously left out as my colleagues left work to watch the England match yesterday.  This despite the fact that I didn’t want to watch it,  I purposely avoided watching it, and I intended/hoped to take advantage of the reduced commuter traffic (not much reduced, as it happened: such is London’s diversity) to get home easily, and collect my kids from school.</p>
<p>Where they were watching the football, of course, courtesy of the after-school club.</p>
<p>Above all, if I had intended to watch it, my sympathies would have been with the other side anyway: I am Scottish, after all, and as my Dad used to say, “It doesn’t matter who wins, as long as it’s not England.”  Plus I’m a sucker for an underdog (I mistyped that as “undergod”; there’s a story in there, I’m sure).</p>
<p>But despite all that, as my colleagues left the office for the pub or wherever, I still felt a slight echo of the thing I felt as a kid when I was left out of something that “everyone else” was doing.</p>
<p>We all want to be part of a tribe, I suppose.</p>
<p>In the end I watched he last half hour or so at the school; from just before the scary personality-cult chants of “Rooney, Rooney!” to the end.  The cheers, as you might expect in a primary school, were very high and shrill.  I was pleased, though, that Trinidad and Tobago’s goal (before it was disallowed) got almost as loud a cheer.  This was Hackney, and of course, there are a lot of kids with Caribbean ancestry.</p>
<p>And maybe a lot of good sports, too.  Maybe I should learn from them, and support England.  But I can’t see it ever happening: there are some early-learned prejudices that die impossibly hard.</p>
<p>So I guess I’m still part of a tribe.</p>

			 <html><body><h2>Eyes in the sky</h2>
<p>There is a strange and mighty power to eye contact, it seems.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about the effects of making — or not making — eye contact while talking to someone, though of course that does indeed have a great symbolic strength and communicative ability.  Rather, I’m talking about the effect of making eye contact at a distance; specifically while cycling.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, cycling round the streets of London has its hazards.  It’s not as fraught with danger as some believe (fear of the dangers is one of the main reasons people give for why they don’t, or wouldn’t, cycle; which is a shame, because it’s good for the individual, and good for the environment), but that’s another discussion.</p>
<p>Most potential problems can be avoided with a suitable degree of alertness.  But the necessary alertness isn’t all on the part of the cyclist: it’s important for other road users to be alert to the presence of cyclists, too.  Who remembers “Think once, think twice, think <em>bike!</em>“, the road-safety campaign on British TV during the seventies?  That was intended to make other road-users more aware of cyclists (and motorcyclists).</p>
<p>That is where one of the biggest dangers lies: quite frankly, there are a lot of road users who just don’t notice cyclists.  And it’s not just the BMW  drivers and Royal Mail vans (in my experience the two most dangerous types of motorised vehicle, from a cyclist’s point of view (though all generalisations are false, of course)).</p>
<p>No, any motor vehicle can be a problem, and pedestrians and even other cyclists are almost as bad.  Indeed , the two accidents I’ve had in all my years of cycling in London were both caused, at least in part, by pedestrians.  There is, however, a simple technique that can — almost magically, it sometimes seems — make other road users notice you.</p>
<p>Look them in the eye.</p>
<p>That’s it.  That’s all there is to it.  Just make eye contact with the driver, cyclist or pedestrian, and suddenly they realise you’re there.</p>
<p>Which is not so surprising: it’s hard to <em>not</em> be aware of the presence of someone who is looking you in the eye.  What is strange, though, is the way in which it works at a distance.  You don’t have to be able to see the other person’s eyes, or even to see the person.  Innumerable times I have been hurtling along a road and seen a car or van about to pull out of a side road and smash into me (or at least, make me brake sharply).  I can’t see the driver because of distance or dark windows, but I aim a hard stare at the area where I know the driver’s head must be.  And the car (or van) suddenly brakes, and lets me sweep past.</p>
<p>Similarly, a burst of laser-like staring swept across a group of pedestrians can stop them stepping off the kerb and into my path.  It’s quite remarkable, really.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of the story of James Dean’s death.  He crashed his car into another car that was pulling out of a side road, and supposedly Dean said to his passenger, (who survived the crash), “It’s all right, he sees me.”</p>
<p>Clearly, the other driver didn’t.  Perhaps if Dean had just tried looking at where the other driver’s eyes were, the strange, near-telepathic effect might have happened, and he could have lived to make many more films.</p>
<p>The effect is, I suspect, related to the “feeling of being watched” that most people have experienced at some time.   There’s no obvious mechanism for it, but it does seem to be the case that, when someone is looking at us, we become aware of the fact.</p>
<h2>Attention surfeit disorder?</h2>
<p>When some one is looking at us, or is <em>paying attention to us</em>.  Which brings me to another angle on this.  That is the idea of <em>attention.</em>.  Up here in The Future, in the days of the development of “Web 2.0″ (which, by the way, is pronounced “two point zero”, not “two point oh”, as I heard them saying on <cite>Newsnight</cite> the other day; we are, after all, scientists) we are often told (though perhaps mainly by <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls</a>) of how important our attention is.</p>
<p>Indeed, the phrase “the <a href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_4/goldhaber/">attention economy</a>” is in use by some.  Of course, the expression “pay attention” has been around for a long time, but only now has attention taken on some of the other trappings of money.  We can “pay” for a web site’s services with our attention.  Any site with adverts effectively meets this model, though there are more direct examples, such as <a href="http://www.salon.com/">Salon</a>‘s premium content, for which you can get a “day pass” by <a href="http://images.salon.com/src/pass/sitepass/demo2.html?x">sitting through a short advert</a> — as an alternative to paying actual cash for a subscription.</p>
<p>The force of our attention — of looking — is powerful in multiple ways.</p>

Then, it was clearly impressive; but wasn’t clear quite how glorious, how <em>majestic</em> it would be once it was moving among crowds.</p>
<p>We drove in to Holborn and took the Tube to Green Park.  The Tube was crammed, and I assumed (and feared) that everyone there would have the same aim as us.  But no, it was just a commonplace weekend crowd, with many destinations in mind.  When we got out, Piccadilly was busy, but not obviously in an unusual way.</p>
<p>We could see that the road was partly closed in the direction of  Piccadilly Circus, so we headed that way.  In the distance we could see crowds of people, but no obvious <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simon-crubellier/142413207/in/set-72057594125598140/">forty-foot elephant</a> (and it’s hard to imagine a forty-foot elephant being anything else).  One of the stewards told us that it was going to turn down Haymarket and then into Pall Mall.</p>
<p>Then, as we got a bit closer to the Circus, I caught a glimpse of a large leather ear flapping, and soon we could all see its head.  But Piccadilly had never seemed so long, and it began to feel as if we wouldn’t catch it, though it was obviously going very slowly.</p>
<p>I hoped to get a picture of it with the statue of Eros in the same shot, but it was not to be.  By the time we got to Piccadilly circus, it had already turned into Haymarket.  So we decided to cut down Regent Street and get ahead of it.  Guess what?  We weren’t the only ones to have that idea.  By this time we were among crowds, but not so dense that it was very hard to move; just dense enough to make us keep a tight hold on the kids.</p>
<p>A bit of zigzagging through back streets and we found ourselves on Charles II Street.  Iit was clear from the music coming from Haymarket that the elephant hadn’t passed yet, and from the layout of the crowd that it would be coming along that way.  So we positioned ourselves at the edge of the pavement and waited.</p>
<p>Sure enought, after a few minutes some stewards came along the street asking people to stay back on the pavements.  Another few minutes and several police officers came along with the same message.</p>
<p>It’s worth pointing out both how good a job the stewards and the police did, and how little they actually <em>had</em> to do (from what I saw of it).  It just goes to show that you can stage a big event with minimal crowd control.  Treat people with respect and give them something interesting to watch and you don’t need to herd them through crash barriers like cattle in a slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>Anyway, a few minutes after <em>that</em>, and the elephant’s head began to appear round the corner.  It was, as I said above, <em>majestic</em>: that’s the word that came to my mind as soon as I saw it.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it was the beauty of the beast, or the fact that there were bagpipes among the music that was playing (the pipes always get me like that); but I felt a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye as it approached.</p>
<p>Then the fucker sprayed me with water.</p>
<p>Actually, being sprayed was quite fun.  Fortunately it was a hot day.  But I got hit so directly that I could almost hear the operators saying,”Get the guy in the orange t-shirt and sunglasses.”  If you don’t want to get hit, don’t dress up like a target, I suppose.</p>
<p>As the beast itself passed next to us, and I got a brief chance to admire the action of the legs (it moves on wheels, but the leg movement is very convincing), I realised that the music was coming from a truck behind it on which a live band was playing.  I had assumed it was just recordings, but the band added an extra touch, and we got to listen to them up close.  They were good, and I’d like to find out who they were.</p>
<p>After it passed, and the crowd thinned a bit, we decided to head round to Waterloo Place to see the Little Girl’s crashed space capsule; not realising that it had been moved.  No matter, though: it meant we got another view of the elephant as it turned onto Pall Mall.</p>
<p>And so to home.  We didn’t stay to see the finalé, so we didn’t see the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simon-crubellier/141571479/">Little Girl</a> at all; nor did we see her spaceship.  All that was left on Waterloo Place was a hole in the road, which people, in their infinite capacity to make a mess, had already started dropping rubbish into.  As it turned out, the ship had been moved to Horseguards for her to leave in.</p>
<p>It was a fabulous thing to see, though, and I’m so glad that the Mayor and the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> saw fit to have it here.</p>
<p>My son asked me at one point, as the music surrounded us and the elephant towered over us, “Why did it come to London?”   I answered with joy and almost without thinking about it, “Because this is the best city in the world.”</p>
<p>Sometimes it is.</p>

			 <html><body><p>It’s my custom prior to elections to write a post giving “voting advice”.  Of course, I don’t expect anyone to take this advice: I’m just thinking out loud, really.</p>
<p>But now, with local elections happening tomorrow, I’m in something of a quandary.  It’s always been easy in the past  —  or it was, before the last general election: vote Labour.  There, that was easy, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>But now; now.</p>
<p>Now Labour are the ones who are bringing in <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=24">ID cards</a>.  They’re the ones who are trying to allow themselves to <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=17">make laws without parliament</a>.  They’re the ones who’re putting a new face on sleaze by <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=18">selling peerages</a>.</p>
<p>There is no way I can vote for them while they support <a href="http://www.no2id.net/">ID cards</a>; nor could I vote for any other party that did.  Nor, no matter how cuddly and environmental David Cameron appears, there is no way in hell I could ever vote Tory.</p>
<p>In the last general election <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/27082.html">I voted Liberal Democrat</a>, and I suppose it might have to go that way in tomorrow’s locals.  The thing is, I’m not totally sure that I would want to enact a change in our local council.  Things have been getting quite good in Hackney’s services recently, what with their roadside recycling and what have you.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.respectcoalition.org/">Respect Party</a>‘s <a href="http://www.respectcoalition.org/2006/local.php?seatid=69">candidate</a> for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4878524.stm">Hackney’s mayor</a> is the father of a friend of my daughter, so I kind of know him.  He came to the door last night, and I asked him about their position on ID cards (not a local issue, of course, but still).  Totally against, which is good.  So voting for him is tempting, but I have my doubts about the party leader, George Galloway.  His performance at the US senate was genius, but there is still the “indefatigability” speech, and the way he campaigned against Una King in Bethnal Green.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Green Party.  Always a possibility; but I have my reservations about their positions on everything but the environment.</p>
<p>You know, I might not actually decide until I step into the booth tomorrow.</p>

			 <html><body><p>The fact that some of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,,-5795352,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704">ex-cons who are foreign nationals</a> have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4954476.stm">offended again</a> should come as no surprise whatsoever: many convicted criminals re-offend after their release.   It should be nothing more than expected.  Nor is the fact of their re-offending in itself part of the scandal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as has been said elsewhere, these thousand or so released offenders pose no greater or lesser threat to society than any other random thousand offenders.  Their only difference is that they are not British citizens.  Contrary to the belief, perhaps, of the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> and its readers, that does not inherently make them worse people — nor, indeed, any more likely to re-offend — than those of us who were born here.</p>
<p>That they should have been deported if the court specified that as part of their sentences is self-evident.  As indeed is the fact that those who were released on licence should have been properly tracked by the appropriate authorities.  These are problems in the systems for which the Home Office is responsible, and as such, they should be investigated and corrected.</p>
<p>The real scandal, though,  is that the Home Secretary apparently did nothing to correct the problem after it had been identified: he is said to have known about it for some ten months, and only in the last week has he taken any action.  And then only because a diligent opposition MP kept asking questions until he found out about it.</p>
<p>In a sense the actual problems are minor: the supposedly-lost offenders have been located by the Police and Parole Service.  Most of them are now to be deported (which strikes me as verging on double jeopardy, since they have already done their time, but I wouldn’t expect this government to let a little thing like that bother them).  Steps have been, or will be, put in place to prevent the same thing happening in future.  If that proves not to be the case, there will be plenty of opposition MPs and journalists quick to point out that the problem still exists.</p>
<p>What we are seeing is largely an excuse for a mass exercise in xenophobia by the media: a depressing and frankly disgraceful display, which can only help to fuel the arguments of the vile BNP in tomorrow’s local elections.</p>
<p>And maybe that is why Clarke should go: for (inadvertantly) giving succour to fascists.</p>
<p>But if Blair did accept Clarke’s resignation, who would we get in his place?  Whoever it was, I can’t imagine that they would be  much better.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I don’t mean to come over all <a href="http://www.20six.co.uk/disgruntled">disgruntled</a> <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=26">again</a>, but on arriving at <a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/Stations/stations/Waterloo/Default.aspx">Waterloo</a> (by bike) this morning, I found two changes which seemed designed to inconvenience travellers, with no obvious gain.</p>
<p>First, at the entrance I usually roll in by (the wide one next to the Costa Coffee shop), they have added two bollards.  Quite widely spaced, so no immediate problem for cyclists or pedestrians: except that <em>anything</em> unnecessary in the way is a distraction and just adds to the complexity of a journey.  And what purpose do they serve?  All they can possibly be for is to stop cars and vans driving in that way.  And while that is something that has been technically possible until now, I wasn’t at all aware that we had a problem with it.</p>
<p>Indeed, apart from floor-cleaning machines and those little luggage carts, the only motorised vehicle I’ve ever seen inside Waterloo is an ambulance.  I do hope they haven’t stopped those from getting in.</p>
<p>Perhaps more significantly, they have added some sort of tall rack containing, I think, paper timetables or other leaflets.  But they’ve put it in the middle of the floor near the the departures screens.  So not only is it in the way, but from certain positions it obscures the view of the screens.</p>
<p>Screens which have been hard enough to see since they were introduced, replacing the old big boards.  The screens’ main fault is that they are in the wrong places: over some of the shops which form islands in the concourse, instead of over the entrances to the platforms.  As well as that, the text on them is smaller than the old boards, so you have to stand closer to make them out.  This last will have the effect of amplifying the blockage caused by the rack (this can be proved by a simple piece of geometry, which I won’t go into).</p>
<p>At least the rack looks as if it should be easy to remove; but bah, grumble, etc.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I take a couple of weeks off (a week at home with the kids, a week in Dorset: very nice, thanks, since you ask) and when I first get back to posting, I find I’m channelling the excellent <a href="http://www.20six.co.uk/disgruntled">Disgruntled Commuter</a>.  This morning’s journey into work was a vision of madness and chaos straight out of Dante’s <cite>Inferno</cite>.</p>
<p>I exaggerate, of course.  The Waterloo and City Line is a key link in my standard route to work, when I go purely by public transport.  Hackney to Wimbledon is not the simplest route between two parts of London, but it doesn’t have to be insane.  That line, though, is currently closed.  Until <em>September</em>.  If we assume it won’t reopen until the end of that month at the earliest, that means it will be closed for half the year.  I understand that things wear out and break down and have to be maintained: but it only goes between two stations.  There’s not that much to it.  How long can things take?</p>
<p>So for two days this week I cycled to Waterloo (I work at home on Wednesdays) which is the best way to get in anyway, for all the usual reasons why cycling is best<sup><a href="#tal1_1" name="tal1_1_back">1</a></sup>.  But lately I’ve fallen out of the habit.  To break myself back in gently (in other words, to give myself a rest from it today, or out of sheer laziness), I decided to chance public transport today.</p>
<p>I’m a great fan of public transport generally, of course: but there are times and services that… don’t show it in its best light, let’s say.  The North London Line is one that has a bad reputation at best: indeed, the aforementioned Disgruntled one has <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww%2E20six%2Eco%2Euk%2Fdisgruntled+%22north+london+line%22">written about it</a> in the past.  Yet gettting that line to Highbury and Islington and then the Victoria Line to Vauxhall for the last leg to Wimbledon seemed the best alternative route for me.</p>
<p>You’ll have guessed, since I’m writing this, that it was not.</p>
<p>The North London Line is characterised by infrequent, jam-packed services, and it deserves the characterisation.  Don’t get the idea that this was a surprise to me: I knew perfectly well what it would be like.  What do you think was the biggest prod to get me back onto my bike?</p>
<p>So that wasn’t really the problem (though the difficulty of seeing the station name signs when you’re jammed in standing up makes it extra hard for the infrequent user to be sure they are at the correct station).  No, the problem was my old friend<sup><a href="#tal1_2" name="tal1_2_back">2</a></sup> the Victoria Line.</p>
<p>It was, in short, fucked.</p>
<p>So I got on that curious bit of non-Underground underground line that also runs out of Highbury and Islington (and that I can’t remember the name of), and got a train to Moorgate.  Thence by Northern Line to London Bridge and Jubilee to Waterloo.  I left home at about 8:15 (significantly later than I originally intended to, admittedly) and the train from Waterloo pullled into Wimbledon at 9:35.  Bah!</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr>
<p><a name="tal1_1" href="#tal1_1_back">1.</a> Exercise, knowing fairly exactly when you’re going to get there, and not being at the mercy of the transport network chief among them.</p>
<p><a name="tal1_2" href="#tal1_2_back">2.</a> Before I lived in Hackney I lived in Walthamstow.  You get on at the start of the line (and thus are almost guaranteed a seat) plonk yourself down, open your book, and don’t look up until Vauxhall.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Well, I feel like a proper 21st-century blogger at the moment: I’m sitting typing this in a cafe.  Specifically, the Clissold House Cafe, in Clissold Park in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_Newington">Stoke Newington</a>, North London.  The kids are currently at a tennis ‘camp’ (two hours’ intensive training a day for four days this week).  It being the school holidays, I’ve taken the week off work to look after them.</p>
<p>So with two hours to fill, I went for a wander round the shops of Church Street (only bought two books in a second-hand bookshop) and now I’m back at the park, waiting for the tennis to finish.  I’m typing this on my Palm with folding keyboard setup.  It doesn’t have anything fancy like WiFi or Bluetooth, so by the time you read this it will be (at least) several hours later, when I upload it to the PC and post.</p>
<p>The coffee’s not very good, either.  Their specialty is more cakes here, but I’m holding off until lunchtime.</p>
<p>I’m am reminded as I type of the existence of <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/">John Scalzi</a>‘s book on writing, <a href="http://www.subterraneanpress.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=scalzi03&amp;Category_Code=PRE&amp;Product_Count=22"><cite>You’re Not Fooling Anyone When You Take Your Laptop to a Coffee Shop: Scalzi on Writing</cite></a>.  Still, I’m not trying to impress (or, indeed, fool) anyone (nor, I imagine, succeeding in doing so).</p>
<p>At the same time I’m listening to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/">Radio 4</a>, where there’s a program about ‘battleaxes’, which is kind of bollocks, as all such stereotypes are.  It isn’t annoying me enough to switch it off yet, though.</p>
<p>Curiously, they just played an extract from <cite>Fawlty Towers</cite> that I don’t remember ever hearing.  There’s only about twelve episodes, so it’s hard to imagine that there’s one I’ve never seen.  Then they’ve been talking about Thatcher as a battleaxe, which is an interesting one that I won’t go into here.</p>
<p>I sat down to write fiction, but ended up doing this.  It doesn’t make for the greatest of blog entries, but I suppose it serves as slight relief from bleak political posts.</p>
<p>Damn, nearly made it without mentioning politics.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I’m thinking of declaring the 29th of March 2006 ‘[tag]Freedom Day[/tag]‘, because it is the day that freedom died; or at least started to. </p>
<p>Maybe I’m being over-dramatic — even melodramatic — in these posts; but I don’t think so.</p>
<p>The House of Lords has been doing sterling work in standing up to the [tag]ID Cards bill[/tag], as have the few sane voices in the Commons: Liberal Democrats, some Tories, and a few brave Labour rebels.  But yesterday the Lords accepted a ‘compromise’: from 2008, when we get or renew a passport, our details will be placed on the [tag]National Identity Register[/tag].  However, we will have the option of opting out of getting an [tag]Identity Card[/tag].</p>
<p>Err, excuse me?  Is it possible that their lordships have <em>totally missed the point</em>?  The database is the whole problem. The database is the thing we can’t step back from.  The database is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure">single point of failure</a>.  An identity card — just a card with some personal information, such as our parents or grandparents had during the second world war — would be bad: but the real problem in the modern age is that the card itself is just a key to the database<sup><a href="#PoliceState1_1" name="PoliceState1_1back">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>What were they <em>thinking</em> of?  For that matter what were the Commons thinking of in letting this through, and what were the government thinking of in introducing it in the first place?  Are these people so dazzled by power — is the Labour party so intoxicated by its brief<sup><a href="#PoliceState1_2" name="PoliceState1_2back">2</a></sup>, unfamiliar taste of it — that they can think only of exercising it in more and more repressive and restrictive ways?</p>
<p>Welcome to the police state, people: maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>And while it might not be the end of the world — many people all through history and into the present have had to live under far worse conditions than we can expect here in Britain — it is the end of something we might call the British Dream.  The idea of Britain as one of the oldest modern democracies, governed by ‘the Mother of Parliaments’; of Britain as any kind of bastion of freedom: that idea died a bit yesterday.  And it will die a little more today, as the legislation is passed; and a little bit more in the future.  It is dying by pieces; we may not live to see it choking its last breath out in the gutters; but our children will.  And by the time that last gasp happens, it will be too late to do anything about it.</p>
<p>I only hope that our children will be able to find some way to resurrect it.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr>
<a name="PoliceState1_1" href="#PoliceState1_1back">1.</a>Perhaps not <em>just</em> a key to the database: presumably a smartcard, it will actually be able to hold a lot of data itself.
<p><a name="PoliceState1_2" href="#PoliceState1_2back">2.</a>Even at nine years it seems pretty brief to me.  Especially compared to what came before.  Though even Thatcher never tried anything like this.

			 <html><body><p>This is an interesting one: another Booker nominee, if I’m not very much mistaken, and a strange and masterful work.  It is a portrait of a single day in the life of its protagonist, one Henry Perowne, a successful neurosurgeon.<br>
<br>
For a large part of the novel there is essentially no plot as such.  Indeed you could probably argue that the whole thing has no plot; though things happen early in the day that have consequences later in the day.  But despite the exiling of plot — of story itself, you might say — to the background, this is an immensely compelling work.</p>
<p>Such is the quality of the writing (I can only assume: I can’t honestly say that I understand how he does it) that the small and largely insignificant actions of one man and his family, and the musings of that man (it is a third-person narrative, but with only a single viewpoint; it is exclusively focalised on/through Perowne) command the attention and require the turning of pages.</p>
<p>This is great, really great; and the characters are endearing enough that I want to know what happened to them afterwards: indeed, what is still happening to them now.</p>
<p>Everything I’ve ever read about this book makes quite a big thing of the Saturday in question being the one of the big anti-(Iraq) war demo in London (and around the world).  But in fact that is only really a very minor physical background to an early chapter.  Certainly it provides fuel for Perowne’s thoughts, and for a heated discussion with his daughter; but the fact of it happening on that day is not really significant.  Which makes me wonder whether he only did it as an attention-grabbing device, much as Banksie did when he set the first chapter  of <cite>Dead Air</cite> on the 11th of September, 2001.  Still, there’s nothing wrong with grabbing the reader’s attention, as long as the device is integrated fully into the story, and doesn’t jar with the narrative: and such is the case here.</p>

<ol>
<li>  <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/30844.html">The first volume of <cite>A Dance to the Music of Time</cite><cite>, by Anthony Powell</cite></a></li>
<li>  <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/30993.html"><cite>Cloud Atlas</cite>, by David Mitchell</a></li>

</ol>
<p>No a bad wee collection, if I say so myself.  I’ve also read Ian McEwan’s <cite>Saturday</cite>, which I’ll be posting about shortly, and am struggling through (while enjoying) Iain Sinclair’s <cite>London Orbital</cite>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Turning away from politics, for a wee while, I’ve been finding things have been pretty good in the TV world, recently.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed <cite><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/lifeonmars/">Life On Mars</a></cite> on BBC 1, recently.  I expected slightly better — or at least different — of it when it was first announced: I thought there would be more (or some) ambiguity or doubt about whether Sam Tyler was experiencing it all in his mind while in a coma, or had actually travelled in time.</p>
<p>Shortly after the start there was no such ambiguity about that, and we were deep in <cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_(Iain_Banks)">The Bridge</a></cite> or <cite><a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,772790,00.html">Marabou Stork Nightmares</a></cite> territory (if you can compare a TV series with a novel, then I’d say it’s better than the latter but nowhere near as good (obviously) as the former).  What I was hoping for in the final episode, though, is that Sam would wake up back in 2006; and that he would then look into the history of the personnel at the station, and find that Gene Hunt and the others (and DI Sam Tyler, for that matter) really existed.  Maybe he would even look up a now-aged and retired Gene, an Annie who is a grandmother.</p>
<p>Obvious, maybe, but it could have been a nice touch.</p>
<p>I had some mixed feelings about the whole thing, though.  I wanted it to be resolved and completed, for dramatic satisfaction.   But I so much enjoyed the interactions between the characters (especially the growing and grudging respect between Tyler and Hunt) and the quality of most of the stories that I became (and remain) keen to see more.  If he had woken up, there would be no going back.</p>
<p><cite><a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/W/westwing/">The West Wing</a></cite> maintained its high standard through the recent season (in fact this season, 6, was significantly better than 5 was, I would say) and I’m profoundly glad that we got a digibox and so could watch it on the excellent More4, rather than having to wait for the DVDs to be released.  More4 are taking us straight into season 7, so only <strike>22</strike> 21 more weeks and then it’s over forever.</p>
<p>More4 is also where we get <cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Show">The Daily Show With John Stewart</a></cite>, to give it its full-length name.  This is just a fabulous show; hilarious, thought-provoking and informative.  What more could you ask for?</p>
<p>Well, I could ask for something as good — and in a similar vein — for Britain.</p>
<p><cite><a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/">The IT Crowd</a></cite> was disappointing enough after two or three episodes that I didn’t bother to work around its clashing with <cite>The West Wing</cite> on Friday nights).  I’ve read <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2006/02/06/">some positive comments</a> on it, though, and it <em>ought</em> to have been good, given its pedigree; so maybe I’ll watch out for the repeats.  I wonder if that stupid announcer ever stopped calling it ‘The it Crowd’, though?</p>
<p><cite><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/hyperdrive/">Hyperdrive</a></cite> was largely disappointing, and <cite>Invasion</cite> just petered out: that is, I petered out of watching it.</p>
<p>Most importantly (in comedy, at least): at last they’ve started showing the trailers I’ve been waiting for: “New <cite><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423661/">Green Wing</a></cite>.  Nearly ready.”  Hooray!  The funniest comedy of the last few years: right up there with <cite><a href="http://www.absolutelyandy.com/absolutely/">Absolutely</a></cite>  I can hardly wait.</p>
<p>And to top all that, my old friend from uni, <a href="http://talefromtwocities.blogspot.com/">Paul Cockburn</a> inadvertently <a href="http://talefromtwocities.blogspot.com/2006/03/secret-devotee.html">reminds me</a> that the new <cite><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho">Doctor Who</a></cite> will be starting quite soon.  Fantastic!</p>

			 <html><body><p>There is now a deadly danger to British democracy.  One that is even worse than the <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/31871.html">ID cards</a> bill.</p>
<p>Not for nothing are they calling it the ‘Abolition of Parliament’ bill.  Its official name is the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/141/06141.1-7.html">Legislative and Regulatory Reform bill</a>, and it is, quite simply an attempt to take control of power in this country into the hands of the executive forever,and remove the possibility of parliamentary scrutiny from the exercise of that power.</p>
<p>The bill grants ministers the power to create, modify or strike down laws;  and to introduce offenses carrying prison terms of up to two years.</p>
<p>It contains some limits: for example section 3(2)(c) requires that “the provision, taken as a whole, strikes a fair balance between the public interest and the interests of any person adversely affected by it”.  However, remember that the bill grants the power to modify existing legislation; that does not exclude itself.  So if this bill had become an Act of Parliament, there would be nothing to stop a future government from modifying the Act itself to, for example, increase the maximum sentence, or remove the limitations it contains.</p>
<p>This government has, after early successes in introducing the minimum wage and the Human Rights Act, been moving in a more and more authoritarian direction.  Obvious examples are ID cards; the attempt to reduce the right to trial by jury; and the increase in the period of detention without trial.</p>
<p>But let’s not forget their support for US ‘extreme rendition’ flights, and the illegal detentions at Guantánamo Bay (they may not have actively and openly supported those, but they failed to condemn them, or do anything to stop them, which amounts to the same thing).</p>
<p>From ASBOs to the ‘Respect Agenda’<sup><a href="#abolition_ftn1" title="abolition_ftn1_back">1</a></sup>, it’s clear that Blair and his spineless — or perhaps totally complicit — cronies are all about applying controls and limits.</p>
<p>If this bill goes through, there are, as far as I can tell, two possible escape routes.  Judges — even the Law Lords — might strike it down as unlawful under the Human Rights Act, since they are required to consider all new laws in light thereof.  The problem there, though, is that the bill — the Act, if it passes — does not directly infringe anyone’s human rights.  Instead, it is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act">enabler</a>.  It is laws introduced or modified using this Act that may (that will, let’s face it) infringe our human rights.</p>
<p>The second escape route?  I can’t see one short of revolution.  And that means civil war.  And that’s no escape at all.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this, please: don’t just take my word for it.  Visit the <a href="http://saveparliament.org.uk/">Save Parliament</a> website and look at the resources there.  Do some other research.  But when you are suitably terrified, <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">write to your MP</a>; write to the editor of your favourite paper and ask them why they are not kicking up a fuss about this.  Tell your friends.  Tell your enemies.  Tell people in the street</p>
<p>If we don’t stop this, it may not mean jackboots in the streets and the knock on the door in the night; but it will mean the effective end of democracy in the UK.</p>

<a href="#abolition_ftn1_back" title="abolition_ftn1">1.</a><br>
On ‘respect’: I am convinced that Blair doesn’t mean that word as the rest of us mean it.  Instead, what he really wants to see more of in society is <em>deference</em>.  When I thought of this truth several months ago, my attitude was, “Stuff it mate, we’ve left that behind us a century or more ago, and we ain’t going back to it.”  But now, of course, I feel the terror that deference will be made mandatory by ministerial diktat.

			 <html><body><p>… same as the <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com">old blog</a>.</p>
<p>Well, not quite the same.  This one is on my own site, for one thing.</p>
<p>A new blog, though: just what the world needs, <a href="http://technorati.com/">don’t you think</a>?</p>
<p>As this is the first entry here, I can’t help but feel a certain… pressure, let’s say.  Because, after all, in years to come, when this blog is one of the most popular sites on the internet<sup><a title="first_note1_back" href="#first_note1">1</a></sup>, millions of people will look back through the entries, and pay special attention to the first one.  Obviously its content is critically important.  Unfortunately, its content is rubbish.</p>
<p>Well, its content was going to be rubbish: or rather, <em>about</em> rubbish; about the guy who was <a href="http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=361722006">fined for dropping rubbish into a bin</a>.</p>
<p>But many people have written about the stupidity of that, and in any case, the council in question have already, and predictably, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/4792490.stm">gone back on their foolish decision</a>.</p>
<p>Instead I thought I might write about the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/4788912.stm">hat woman</a>.  But actually that’s too boring to go into.  Pubs with “no-hat” rules, though: truly madness walks among us.  Actually, the scary thing about that story is that there are pubs with CCTV cameras <em>inside</em> them.  Truly we are the most watched society in the world.</p>
<p>Maybe that should be the theme of this blog, if it needs one: the madness of modern society.</p>
<p>I’d hate to come over like some old grouch, though, railing against modernity: “It wisnae like that when ah wuz a wean, by the way jimmy.”</p>
<p>Or not too often, at least.  No, instead, like most blogs — like all the best ones — I’ll just write about whatever the hell I feel like.</p>
<p>Modern weirdness, though: I just heard about the recent trends for “<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4792104.stm">internet suicides</a>” in Japan; and the fact that the US Nasdaq exchange has <a href="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1728537,00.html">made an offer to buy the London Stock Exchange</a>.  Apparently there are shares in the Stock Exchange: it’s a company.  For some reason I find this immensely surprising.   I would have thought (if I had ever thought of such a thing) that it was some kind of public body, like the Bank of England.  Apparently not, though.   Life’s strangenesses, I think, will be a recurring feature here.</p>

<p><a title="first_note1" href="#first_note1_back">1.</a> this is meant to be humorous, by the way.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I went out for a drink with some people from work last night.  We went to a place in Covent Garden called <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/36/366/Porterhouse/Covent_Garden">The Porterhouse</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a very curious place.  It extends across three or maybe four floors.  Or maybe only two, but with lots of mezzanines.  It’s full of alcoves: everything, it seems, is an alcove.  I have no idea, for example, how many bars it has.  And in fact, I didn’t go to the bar all night.  That, though, is because they have something that is remarkable in a British pub: table service.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s very strange.  waiters come and go, collecting glasses and trays, but also, when asked, taking orders and returning — very quickly — with trays of beers.</p>
<p>So I spent the night drinking Caledonian 80/-.  A taste of home, perhaps, but a) it was bottled; b) it was too cold to taste right; and c) it’s been such a long time since I drank it back home that it hardly counts.  And I always preferred McEwan’s 80/-, anyway.  Oh, and pizza.  They serve food, too, and claim a woodburning oven.</p>
<p>It was a good night.  But that pub.  You know the old computer game that used to say, “You are in a maze of little twisty passages, all the same”?  It was a bit like that.  But mostly it reminded me of the house in HP Lovecraft’s ‘<a href="http://www.gordon-fernandes.com/hp-lovecraft/Dreams%20in%20the%20Witch-House%20by%20H_%20P_%20Lovecraft.htm">Dreams in the Witch-House</a>.’</p>
<p>Oh, I suppose the angles weren’t <em>really</em> that wrong; that the walls were quite straight. But there were definitely <em>too many rooms</em>, and bits, and stuff: if not angles.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I read a review of this book in <cite>The Guardian</cite> years ago (<a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/generalfiction/0,6121,496600,00.html">this one</a>, I think).  It sounded absolutely fantastic, and I’ve wanted to read it ever since.  But I only got round to buying it recently.</p>
<p>I was aware, of course, of the danger of approaching a work with unreasonably-raised expectations, so I tried not to.  You can’t make yourself think “This won’t be very good,” when you actually think, “This should be pretty good.”  The trick, therefore, is to convince yourself to have a slight seed of doubt.  I’m not totally sure how well that can ever work, though.</p>
<p>I did enjoy the book, however: it starts with a light, easy style, and has an endearing central character in Sumire.  
<p>The unnamed (though referred to in the back-cover blurb as “K”) narrator is a slightly-annoying, madly-but-unrequitedly in love  with Sumire figure.  They met at university.  Sumire dropped out to write; the narrator went on to become a schoolteacher.</p></p>
<p>Shortly after the start of the book, Sumire, who has until then seemed largely devoid of any sexual or romantic feelings, falls in love with an older, married, woman; who then gives her a job as her <abbr title="Personal Assistant">PA</abbr>.  Sumire’s love is also unrequited; indeed, unspoken.</p>
<p>It’s when they go on a business trip to Europe, which culminates in a holiday on a Greek island, that something strange happens.</p>
<p>It is a curious book.  It’s hard to work out what is supposed to have happened to Sumire.  It is, until then, so much a realist novel that it is hard to believe that the apparently-fantastic, dream world sequence that is all the explanation we get, is meant to be taken literally.</p>
<p>Then when the narrator, having gone to Greece to help find out what happened to Sumire, returns home to Japan,  there is an apparently-unrelated section concerning one of his pupils.  He has been having a sexual relationship with the pupil’s mother, so when the boy gets into trouble, she calls him to help.  This section really appears to have no connection to the rest of the story,, and no bearing on what happened to Sumire.</p>
<p>So while I enjoyed reading it, on looking back over it, it seems that  it is deeply flawed.  Or maybe I’m flawed, because I failed to fully understand it.</p>
<p>I expected that it would inspire me to read more of his work, but it hasn’t: or not yet, at least.</p>

			 <html><body><p>But not cards, for a change.  I was listening to a programme (essentially a religious one) on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/">Radio 4</a> recently, about ‘Intelligent’ Design (ID).</p>
<p>It was the second time that day that I had heard <a href="http://www.seti.org"><abbr title="Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence">SETI</abbr></a> pulled in to support ID.  The thesis seems to be that, since SETI searches for meaningful information hidden within random noise, it is “the same as” the search for a designer amidst the seeming randomness of the universe.  The proponents of ID think that the complexity of the real world means that there must be an intelligence behind it.  But the main thing these people need to learn is that complexity does not equal design.</p>
<p>Or not necessarily, at any rate.  They are doubly confusing themselves — and others, who may be unsure about the realities of science and the tricks of creationists.  They look at the <em>search</em> for order among the chaos, and liken it to — really, identify it with — the <em>belief</em> that order lies behind the chaos.</p>
<p>Let’s put it another way.  SETI searches through random noise and attempts to find ordered data, all the while aware that the ordered data may not be there; indeed, to date it has not been.  It further proposes that, <em>if</em> ordered data is found, then that may imply that there is an intelligence behind it.</p>
<p>The ID proponents observe the order in the universe and <em>assume</em> that there must be an intelligence behind it; they also see the randomness in the universe, and jump to the conclusion that SETI is doing the same thing as they are.</p>
<p>It is arrant nonsense, of course, but then ID <em>is</em>, from start to finish.  Oh, don’t get me wrong: there’s nothing in the laws of physics, chemistry or biology that <em>precludes</em> the existence of a designer, a creator, a supreme being: a deity, in short.  As, indeed, there is no need for science to be incompatible with belief in, or the existence of, a deity.  Back when I was a Catholic, I remember one of my primary-school  teachers explaining that, while the <cite>Bible</cite> says that God created the world in six days, a day to God might be a million years to us.  Don’t take it literally, in other words.</p>
<p>And therein lies the problem: creationists and believers in ID (who are just very thinly-disguised creationists) take the <cite>Bible</cite> (though which version, I have to ask?) literally.</p>
<p>Which is a bit like taking any of humanity’s great history of myths literally.  Why stop with the Christian <cite>Bible</cite>, and their strange god, “God”<sup><a href="#IDesign1_1">1</a></sup>?  Let’s take the Norse gods literally, for example.  So the next time you’re caught in a thunderstorm, remember, it’s not just the random discharge of static electricity in the atmosphere: Thor is after you.</p>
<p>Or the Greeks: they had some great ones.  When you light the gas to cook tea tonight, say a prayer of thanks to Prometheus, OK?</p>
<p>Oh look, we seem to be back at my latest <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/tag/book+notes">Book Notes</a> post, <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/32227.html"><cite>American Gods</cite></a>.  Which makes sense, since it is American fundamentalist Christers who want to foist their god on the rest of their country — and by extension, on the rest of the world.  By the not-so-subtle device of using the law to control what can and can’t be taught in schools.  What is wrong with these people?  Have they never heard of the separation of church and state?</p>
<p>Fortunately the US courts seem to be holding the line of sanity so far; but oh my non-existent, speculative all-powerful creator-figure: I hope we don’t get a branch of the Christian Taliban trying to introduce this shite into our schools over here.  I have children to bring up, so I have a direct interest in these things.</p>
<p>Let’s not teach our kids to be stupid.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I’ve been reading <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/">Neil Gaiman’s blog</a> since the time when he was writing this book — as, I’m sure, have most of us, what with his site being the number one hit on Google when you <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=neil">search for ‘neil’</a>.</p>
<p>But I  hadn’t actually read the book until now.  I had read the first chapter online, and I had an idea roughly what it was about: real gods (maybe all gods) walking the Earth in the present day.</p>
<p>And it’s a stormer of a book.  The pages just keep turning, the quotes are quotable (girl-Sam’s “<a href="http://www.zeppscommentaries.com/Other_Voices/catechism.htm">I believe</a>” speech is particularly fine) and myths are mashed up in glorious style.</p>
<p>It’s shortcomings are, perhaps, that it slows down a bit too much in the middle section; and Wednesday and Shadow make perhaps too many visits to down-at-heel gods without anything very specific happening during them.  It reads like a road movie in places (which is fine), and it would probably make a good one.</p>
<p>There are surprises right up to the end, though, and I’m sure I’ll read it again in the future.</p>

			 <html><body><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/idcards/story/0,,1708618,00.html">Start saying goodbye</a>, then, to civil liberties in this country.  Oh, maybe not now, and maybe not even that soon; but when the identity cards bill is passed, and the database has been built <sup><a href="#id1_1">1</a></sup> then the infrastructure will be in place for the world’s largest ever experiment in social control.</p>
<p>We already have near-ubiquitous surveillance, with constantly-improving automatic recognition: of faces and of vehicle number plates.  Add to that the national identity database with its biometrics, and the growing collection of DNA data, and I foresee the potential for a future that even Orwell in his worst nightmare wouldn’t have believed possible.</p>
<p>Pessimistic?  Yes, certainly.  It may be that the public will rebel against it when they realise how much it will cost, for example.  I gather that that is what happened in Australia.  But even if they do, once the legislation is in place, how can it be stopped?  It seems likely that the best we can hope for there is a change of government.   And realistically, that means the Tories.</p>
<p>After all this time there’s no way on this Earth that I’m going to put my faith in that lot.  No matter that they might have voted against the government on the bill, if they get into power and the act is in force, there isn’t a chance — not a chance in all the worlds of the putative multiverse — that they’ll repeal the legislation.</p>
<p>In fact, that is the true nightmare scenario: it’s possible that Blair and Brown are not actually malicious about this, just stupid and corrosively misguided.  Imagine, though, what it would have been like if Thatcher’s government had had ubiquitous, mandatory ID and surveillance.  Imagine (as <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/26650.html">I’ve suggested before</a>) if that had been the situation during the miners’ strike.  Or when MI5 were undermining the Callaghan government, for that matter, although that’s a slightly different nightmare.</p>
<p>And it just goes on and on: the Metropolitan Police are now <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4706158.stm">going to drug-test their own officers</a>.  Now, you can safely argue that police officers shouldn’t be under the influence while on duty: but it is a clear violation of their personal liberty, and it just adds to the way in which our national culture is becoming more and more authoritarian.  Even totalitarian.</p>

			 <html><body><p>How quickly do events overrun the tardy blogger.  A few weks ago, when Charles Kennedy <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4582930.stm">went public about his drinking</a>, I started writing a piece about him, and his revelations’ potential effect on the Liberal Democrats.  I didn’t post it that day, and by the following evening things had changed so dramatically that what I said was almost useless as a post.</p>
<p>Later I started a replacement piece, but I never got round to completing and posting that, either.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4699862.stm">Today’s by-election victory</a> is slightly ironic, then, considering that what I was originally saying was  mainly that he really had to resign because he had become an electoral liability to his party.   Add to that the Lib Dem leadership election and its <em>Shock!  Horror!</em> personal revelations, and many would have expected them to do badly at the polls the next time they had a chance.</p>
<p>And then we get Dunfermline.  Which suggests to me that the personal affairs of the actual and potential party leadership are minor items at best in the eyes of the voters.  And also that people (in Scotland, at least) have had enough of Blair’s repulsive Tory-lite policies, and are (not surprisingly) unimpressed by, and suspicious of, Cameron’s cuddly stealth-Tory aproach.</p>
<p>I hoped, in my original piece, that the Lib Dems would be able to recover from their problems, because they’re an important force in British politics.  Not least because they’re still the only ones taking a principled stand against ID cards, on which everyone but <a href="http://no2id.org/">No2ID</a> seems to have gone silent recently.  Now I’d have to add the hope that the new guy, Willie Rennie, can get himself established in the Commons in time to vote against the next reading of the Bill.</p>
<p>I never thought that, in my life, I would be toasting a Labour by-election defeat, while at the same time bemoaning their <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4653722.stm">privatisation</a> and (lack of) civil-liberties policies; but we live in interesting times.  Times in which Britain desperately needs a third force in politics; and it remains the case — perhaps more so than ever, today — that the Liberal Democrats can be that force.</p>
<p>But I wish they weren’t needed: I want the <em>Labour</em> party back.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Cory Doctorow’s third novel is his best so far; and it’s strange.  Really, really strange.</p>
<p>It is the story of a man whose father is a mountain and whose mother is a washing machine.  These are not metaphors.<br>
<p><br>Or perhaps they are.  If so, though  then the whole book is a metaphor, and I’m not entirely sure for what.</p></p>
<p>Since Alan (or Adam, or Albert, or Aaron) is very different from other people (he doesn’t have a navel, for one very minor thing) it could be seen as about alienation.  Alan, however, is not particularly alienated.</p>
<p>His brothers are a different matter, though.</p>
<p>Each of the five is given a name starting with the next letter of the alphabet after the previous brother’s; but they are not called constantly by this name, either by each other or by the narrator.  Instead, they are called by a seemingly-randomly-chosen name starting with ‘their’ letter of the alphabet.  There seems no real purpose to it.  If it is intended to emphasise the brothers’ ‘otherness’, then it does so: but not enough.</p>
<p>As well as that, each brother has a unique characteristic.  Billy, Buddy, Bob (etc) can see the future.  Charlie is an island.  Davey is twisted, damaged and dangerous.  And Ed, Fred and George are a sort of composite being, living inside each other like Russian dolls.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, one of the subplots centres on one of Cory’s real-world interests: building a free, community-supported wireless network across the city (his native Toronto, in this case).  In a way, that subplot doesn’t really mesh very well with the fantastical story: but it does provide a backdrop for it, and it shows that Alan has a life outside of his weird family.</p>
<p>And there’s a woman with wings.  <a href="http://craphound.com/someone/download.php">Read it for yourself</a>.  It’s quite amazing, and like his other books, available for free download under a Creative Commons licence.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Yes, and only a day after the last one.  It took me a bit longer than that to read it, mind you.</p>
<p>A science-fiction book that was nominated for the Booker: amazing.  And have no doubt about it: this <em>is</em> a science-fiction book.  Just as <cite>Nineteen Eighty Four</cite> is; and Orwell’s masterpiece is perhaps the best reference point for <cite>Cloud Atlas</cite>.  The appearance of <strike>O’Brien’s</strike> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Goldstein">Goldstein</a>‘s book within Winston Smith’s story may well have been a model for Mitchell’s multiply-embedded stories.</p>
<p>
<p><br>And like <cite>Nineteen Eighty Four</cite>, <cite>Cloud Atlas</cite> is ultimately a bleak vision, though it contains many life-affirming moments on its way.</p></p>
<p>The interleaved narratives spread across the history and future history of civilisation, from Victorian missionaries ‘civilising’ the ‘savages’ of Polynesia, to the  Hawaian islanders after the fall of civilisation, trying desperately to hold on to the ‘Smart’ of the ‘Old’uns’.</p>
<p>Each story contains a reference to the the one in which it is immediately embedded, and there are echoes and references across various of the layers: probably many more than I got on a first reading.</p>
<p>Mitchell’s command of the different styles is good, though there are one or two places where it slips, and where you wonder how reliable the narrators are.</p>
<p>I found it slow to get going, though: at first I put this down to not being terribly engaged with the Victorian opening section.  Then I thought it was just pacing: the speed of the segments increases, it seems to me, as you work towards the centre.  But on the way back out I found the final section, back in the Victorian journals, just less interesting than any of the others.  I find the idea of historical novels deeply uninteresting, so we probably have a common theme there.</p>
<p>Also related to the “is it genre” question  is this curiousity: in the section entitled <cite>Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery</cite>, the title character’s dead father is called Lester.  Lester Rey.  Sounds an awful lot like <a href="http://www.gwillick.com/Spacelight/delrey.html">Lester del Rey</a>, the science fiction writer and editor.  Of, course, it may mean nothing: but writers don’t choose characters’ names for nothing, and it sems likely to me that you would at least check that the major characters’ names don’t relate to any real people.   So perhaps Mitchell is suggesting something.</p>
<p>But all of this matters little.  What does matter is that this is a damn fine book.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This year I’m going to try to record all the books I read, and write mini-reviews of them.  I’m not quite going for the "50 Book Challenge"  thing, because I doubt that I can actually manage one a week, what with one thing and another.  But I ought to be able to get through a few more than last year, since I’m not doing an <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">OU</a> course.  And in fact it’s nearly the end of January, and I have already read three books and started a fourth: so, not too bad, then.  I’m just a bit behind on posting about them.</lj></p>
<p>For Christmas I got volume 1 of <cite>A Dance to the Music of Time: A Question of Upbringing</cite>.  I started reading it on Christmas day, so we’ll have to allow the year to start and end there.</p>
<p>I have been hearing quite a lot about Anthony Powell’s twelve-volume masterpiece recently: there was a whole Radio 4 programme about it, which I heard bits of twice.  And I notice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel">John Peel’s <cite>Desert Island Discs</cite> listing</a> on Wikipedia, recently, and <cite>Dance</cite> was the book he chose.</p>
<p>So I was keen to read it, despite having seen the TV adaptation a few years ago, and thought it seem very shallow and superficial.<br>
<br>
Having read the first volume I find that it’s not at all surprising that a few hours of TV that purported to convert the whole twelve volumes seemed shallow.  This thing is <em>dense</em>.  The first volume isn’t that long, but it only covers a couple of years of the narrator’s life: the end of school, some time in France, and the start of his university career.</p>
<p>Despite it being set in the years between the first and second World Wars — a time that is almost a century away from us, now — and the fact that the characters are almost exclusively privileged, public-school and Oxbridge types, their concerns aren’t so far from those of my own student days.  Which isn’t so surprising. I suppose: we’re all people, and the state of being a student has always been a rarefied step away from real life.</p>
<p>Anyway, I look forward to working my way through the other eleven volumes.  Perhaps I’ll do them all this year.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This was written before Christmas, and is only being posted now.  Such is… something.  My ability to get things done, probably.</p>
<p>The Brixton Academy oozes rock ‘n’ roll history from its very walls; and a lot of that history is — or closely mirrors — my own.  I saw my first London gig there: <a href="http://www.ramones.com/">The Ramones</a>, in 1987 (and I saw them a few more times there, too, I can tell you).  <a href="http://www.abc.se/%7Em8996/cubes/cubes.html">The Sugarcubes</a> spent a bare hour on stage, and it was one of the best hours of live music I’ve ever seen.  The <a href="http://www.4ad.com/pixies/">Pixies</a> took the place apart and restored my faith in rock ‘n’ roll when I didn’t even realise I was losing it.  <a href="http://www.slf.com/">Stiff Little Fingers</a> — who were the first band I ever saw live (Glasgow Apollo, 1980) — played a farewell gig there (OK, they later reformed, but lets not worry too much about that).  At one <a href="http://www.jamestheband.com/">James </a>gig there, a moshpit full of lovemuppets collapsed on top of me.</p>
<p>But I’ve seen <a href="http://www.pogues.com/">The Pogues</a> there more often than anyone else.</p>
<p>And The Pogues, it seems, have reformed, and are touring.   To Brixton, then, with <a href="http://swisstone.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">swisstone</a>.   I saw them so many times in the eighties and early nineties that I probably wouldn’t have bothered this time.  But back in the summer <a href="http://karmicnull.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">karmicnull</a> gave me a CD by an American band called the <a href="http://www.dropkickmurphys.com/">Dropkick Murphys</a>, which I love; and guess who was the support band?</p>
<p>The Murphys take US hardcore (in the punk sense) and Irish (and a touch of Scottish) music, and mash them together in the same way The Pogues first did with UK punk and Irish music two decades ago.  Loud thrashing guitars meld with bagpipes and rebel lyrics.  There are about six or seven of them, and they move around the Academy’s huge stage like it’s their playground.</p>
<p>That said, and though they rocked mightily, the cavernous space of the Academy did them no favours.  They would, I think, be enjoyed best in a smaller venue.  About a tenth of the size, say.  I found it hard work to appreciate some of the songs I don’t know, so I suspect that if you don’t know their work at all, they would be very hard work indeed, live.  Then there’s their version of ‘The Wild Rover’.  Maybe Americans aren’t as used as we are to every dodgy folk band or drunken denizen of an Irish pub singing this one: but you’d think that when your forté is speeded up, punked up versions of Irish songs, you wouldn’t do a version of it that is, frankly, plodding.</p>
<p>No matter: I’ve now heard them do ‘Fields of Athenry’, live, and am happy.</p>
<p>As to The Pogues: what with one thing and another, I wasn’t totally sure what to expect, after all this time.  But I shouldn’t have worried: it was like coming home: both for them and for me.</p>
<p>Let me say this, in no uncertain terms: I don’t think Shane is anywhere near as fucked up as we think he is.  Yes, he’s done himself damage over the years, and I’ve seem him interviewed on TV and been embarassed and wished they had left him alone.  But that night, although he moved with something of an Ozzy-Osbourne-esque shamble, he was totally switched on.  He didn’t miss a single word, as far as I could tell, and the only mistake he made was that he messed up the first verse of the very last song, ‘Fiesta’; and that’s the kind of thing that any singer can do.</p>
<p>Physically, too, he was very together.  During one song he kept playing with the mike stand, for example, and seemed to constantly be on the verge of knocking it over: but he always caught it.  And at one point he balanced a glass of water on his head.</p>
<p>But what of the music?  It was, of course, superb.  I say “of course” because The Pogues consists of some of the most talented musicians in rock ‘n’ roll, and perhaps the English language’s greatest living poet.</p>
<p>One of their greatest abilities is to make London seem magical, mystic ghostly: songs like ‘Lullaby of London’ is a fine example of this.  And ‘London You’re A Lady’ and ‘Misty Morning, Albert Bridge’ are hymns to the city that are rooted in more mundane concerns; but they still evoke a lyrical beauty.  In a way the effect is not unlike that of Wordsworth’s ‘<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/101/520.html">Composed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802</a>‘.  Yes, I think Shane McGowan is as important a poet as Wordsworth, all right?</p>
<p>There was a spectre hanging over the show, though: it was nearly Christmas, and it was unthinkable that they wouldn’t do ‘Fairytale of New York’.  But who would sing Kirsty McColl’s part?  The song is inherently a duet; there is no way it could be done without two voices.</p>
<p>Tony told me he had heard that Cerys Matthews of Catatonia sang it at the Cardiff gig, but he didn’t think that she was touring with them.</p>
<p>So the end of the third encore and second hour drew close.  “This is ‘Fairytale of New York’”, Shane growled, to cheers.  Then one of the others introduced “Miss Ella Finer.”  One of The Pogues is Jem Finer, as I’m sure you’ll know if you’ve read this far; so I suspected this was his daughter (and internet sources confirm this).</p>
<p>She wasn’t Kirsty, of course, but she did a fine job.  Some of her vowels were on the plummy side (“Happy Christmas your arse, I pray God it’s our larst”, if you see what I mean): but you can’t hold that against her.</p>
<p>So as far as I’m concerned, The Pogues are back.  Now, let’s just hope they write some new material and put a new album out.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Went to see Jon Stewart of <cite>The Daily Show</cite> on Sunday.  He was doing one night in London, with, as it turned out, the executive producer and the head writer of the show.</p>
<p>It was good, though it could cynically be seen as an extended advert for their book, <cite>America: The Book</cite>.  The largest part of the 75-minute show  consisted of readings of extracts from the book.  Those were enough to make me want to buy it,  but the the funniest lines were probably in Stewart’s introductory piece.  The final section, consisting of questions from the audience, showed that both he and his co-stars are generally witty and able to think on their feet.</p>
<p>If volume of applause is a measure, though, the highlight of the night for much of the audience was a brief guest appearance.  “For this next section we’re going to ask for help from a member of the audience.  We picked him before we started, so don’t get up.”  Then a stocky, black-clad figure walked on.  From my position high on the balcony, and with my notedly-poor facial-recognition skills, I couldn’t tell who it was (though Frances, sitting next to me, could).   I’d have recognised his voice, though.  Ricky Gervais is officially more popular in London than Jon Stewart (which is not a surprise).</p>
<p>Gervais read the “funny names” from the book.  This is a section on how US newscasters, weather forecasters and so on, can’t have anything like an ordinary name.  The authors identified formulas for the name-construction for the various roles.  “A monosyllabic kitchen-related verb, followed by two unconnected words.  Eg ‘Chop Muddybottom.’”</p>
<p>As further evidence, were it needed, of my poor celeb-recognition, apparently I literally rubbed shoulders with Alan Rickman on the way out; then Frances said, “There’s Salman Rushdie over there.”  “Where?”  “There: standing in the middle of the road, with all the people round him.”</p>
<p>I did even eventually see him, and recognised him.  And while I accept that I’m bad at recognising faces — and celebrities in particular — I would contend that I just hadn’t noticed him in the crowd at first, and recognised him perfectly well once I knew he was there..</p>
<p>Oh, and the title of this post?  “We don’t torture.  We like to call it, uh, ‘freedom tickling’”</p>

</head><body><p>What, I’m wondering, is the etiquette for this?  I looked over my last post, on <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/%7Edevilgate/29499.html">literary deja vu</a>, and I realised that the second-last paragraph was so scrambled together as to be practically unreadable.  So I’ve just edited it, from the frankly execrable:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;"><p>I did have an experience a bit like this before, though: a few years back I read one of Paul McAuley’s; <cite>Eternal Light</cite>, I think it was, but it is perhaps telling that I can’t remember for sure, even having looked over some reviews.  It seems I <em>still</em> can’t remember it.  It became familar to me in a much more gradual way, and I realised I had read it before.  In that case I had the book out of the library, and I figured out that I had had it out before.  In this case, with the Cadigan, I have no idea where I got the copy that I originally read.  Library?  Maybe.  Borrowed a friend’s?  Always possible.  Or did I buy it, and forget? is there a copy filed away in the attic somewhere?  I just have no idea.</p></blockquote>
<p>to the slightly more readable:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;"><p>But it’s not the first time. A few years back I read one of Paul McAuley’s novels. It is perhaps telling that I can’t remember for sure which one, despite having looked over some reviews. I think it was Eternal Light, but it seems I still can’t remember it.</p>
<p>In any case, it very gradually became familar to me, and I realised I had read it before. The copy I was reading at the time came from the library, and I figured out that I had taken it out before.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>But the question is, <em>should</em> we update a blog post (or a LiveJournal post, if you see a difference) after it has been out there for a while?  Obviously in the first few minutes after posting, when you notice the typoes, it’s fine (and I often wonder about people who <em>don’t</em> correct their typoes; don’t they <em>read</em> their posts?)  Similarly, if it has been up for months, then you should not edit it in any significant way: it’s part of the fabric of the internet (at the risk of sounding pompous).  My concern is when it’s been out for a day or two.</p>
<p>I’m not really concerned in this case: it’s not as if I’ve changed the meaning, and nobody has commented on it, so there’s no concern about comments becoming confusing or misleading.  But in general, I’d be interested to know what people think about changing posts after the fact.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>I’ve been having a slightly strange, but not entirely unfamiliar, reading experience recently.   I’m reading <a href="http://www.sfreviews.com/docs/Pat%20Cadigan_1987_Mindplayers.htm"><cite>Mindplayers</cite></a> by <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/06a/pc82.htm">Pat Cadigan</a>. Now, I read the first chapter of this a long time ago, in the dealers’ room at a convention.  I liked it a lot, and wanted to read on, but the hardback was a bit too expensive at the time.</p>
<p>I decided to keep an eye out for the paperback.  And I did: over the years I often checked the shelves for it, but never found it. As far as I could tell, it never came out in paperback, at least in this country.</p>
<p>And all of this was before Amazon and so on, so I couldn’t just search for it. By the time web-based sales were here, I guess I had forgotten about it.  Certainly I never thought to do a search for it.</p>
<p>Then in the summer we were in Hay-on-Wye, town of bookshops, for a day.  I managed to spend less than £30 on books (though obviously I could have spent a lot more). <br>
But, among my purchases, there it was: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0575071362/102-4550243-4050562?v=glance&amp;n=283155">the Gollancz classics re-issue of Mindplayer</a>.  Slightly strange to find that the book has gone from first publication to classic re-issue in my lifetime, but there you go.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s been high on my to-read pile since then; and I started reading it a week or so ago; alternating it with <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/">Charles Stross</a>‘s <a href="http://www.accelerando.org/"><cite>Accelerando</cite></a> when my  <a href="http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/review/palm_m505_review">Palm</a> is charged.</p>
<p>Now, as I read the first chapter, the fact that it was familiar to me was not at all surprising; I read it at the con years ago, right?  But then I got on to chapter two, as you do.   Strangely, that seemed familiar too.  Hmmm.  OK, maybe I’d read more of it at the con than I thought.</p>
<p>Chapter three: the feeling didn’t go away.   Chapter four.  Chapter five. </p>
<p>Gradually it became apparent that I had, in fact, read the book before.  However, I remembered nothing — absolutely nothing — about the story.  I haven’t finished it yet, and I still have no idea how it ends.</p>
<p>This is a very strange form of <i>deja vu</i>, it seems.</p>
<p>But it’s not the first time.  A few years back I read one of Paul McAuley’s novels.  It is perhaps telling that I can’t remember for sure which one, despite having looked over some reviews.  I <em>think</em> it was <cite>Eternal Light</cite>, but it seems I <em>still</em> can’t remember it.</p>
<p>In any case, it very gradually became familar to me, and I realised I had read it before.  The copy I was reading at the time came from the library, and I figured out that I had taken it out before.</p>
<p>In this case, with the Cadigan, I have no idea where I got the copy that I originally read.  Library?  Maybe.  Borrowed a friend’s?  Always possible.  Or did I buy it, and forget? is there a copy filed away in the attic somewhere?  I just have no idea.</p>
<p>It’s the age, I fear.  Or maybe someone is playing with my mind.</p>

			 <html><body><p><font color="#000000"></font><font color="#000000">I’d like you, if you don’t mind, to join me in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-experiment">thought experiment</a>.</font>
</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#000000">Consider for a moment, a man: he might be young or old, it doesn’t really matter. Tall or short, dark-haired or fair, dark skin or light; none of this matters.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#000000">All that matters is one thing: he is feeling vulnerable as he walks home tonight. He does not project confidence as he walks the dark city streets.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#000000">Perhaps he has been drinking: a swift pint or two after work. Not enough to give him artificial confidence, but enough to lower his vigilance, to make him less cautious than he should be.  Perhaps not, though.<br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#000000">He doesn’t notice the guys in the shadows; or he does, but doesn’t register the danger. Or again, maybe he feels fear: but he’s got to get home, and there’s no other way.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#000000">Whichever it is, he tries to hurry past them, but the blows begin to fall. He tries to run, but they grab him and hit again. He crumples to the ground and rolls against a wall to get some protection. As the kicks start, he slips into unconsciousness.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#000000">Or again, imagine a child, at school.  He </font>–<font color="#000000"> or she, their gender doesn’t matter this time </font>–<font color="#000000"> is one of the smaller, weaker ones in the class; or just isn’t as physically confident or brave as some of their classmates. Maybe this is the child of the man above; maybe not.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#000000">Bullying happens, of course: and this time it happens to the child we are talking about. Their life becomes hell. And it’s hard to find anyone to talk to about it. Parents don’t understand how bad it is. Teachers maybe don’t want to admit it’s happening.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#000000">Maybe they’ll find help from <a href="http://www.childline.org.uk/">Childline</a>, or similar.  Maybe not.</font></p>
<p>What these stories have in common should be obvious: both protagonists were the victims of violent crimes.</p>
<p>Now, would you say – would <i>anyone</i> say – that these imaginary, but all too true, characters were in any way responsible for their suffering?</p>
<p>Of course not. No decent person – no-one with even the most basic shred of empathy and human decency – could blame the victim for the crime they suffered.</p>
<p>Yet blame the victim is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4453820.stm">apparently</a> what one third of British people are prepared to do when the victim is a woman, and the violent crime is rape.</p>
<p>We’ve got a long way to go.
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/%7Eswisstone/268154.html">discussion</a> on <a href="http://swisstone.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">swisstone</a>‘s journal suggests that the <a href="http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/reviews/2005/Amnesty%20International%20-%20Sexual%20abuse/Amnesty%20International%20-%20Sexual%20Abuse.asp">figures</a> could be interpreted differently, and more importantly, that the questions could have been better phrased.  But nonetheless, it is a chilling result.</p>

<p>Even reading the acknowledgements was curiously moving, listing as it did the likes of Billy Bragg, Andy Kershaw and Tom Robinson.  So I read the introduction, which was written by the four kids.  I found myself laughing and my eyes filling with tears just from those three or four pages.  So obviously I had to buy it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>Right then.  It’s been a long time.  But this morning I sat the exam for my latest <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> course, A210, <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C02A210"><span style="font-style: italic;">Approaching Literature</span></a>.  The exam was OK.  Hard questions, but good, you know?  Each section had several questions that I could have a go at answering, but none that immediately leaped out and said, “Do me!”</p>
<p>As to the course itself, well… I’m glad I did it, but in many ways I didn’t really enjoy doing it.  I think I’m coming to the conclusion that, while I love reading the novels and the poetry and the plays, I don’t really enjoy reading the textbooks.  So I felt during much of the course that I only had time — or I only <span style="font-style: italic;">allowed</span> myself time — to study what I needed to write the essays.  Which is all very well, and I did well in the essays; but it isn’t an ideal approach to learning, and I thought it would (and I think it did) leave me wanting when it came to the exam.</p>
<p>Still, we shall see around Christmas time, which is when the results come in.</p>
<p>I had hoped to go and see <span style="font-style: italic;">Serenity</span> afterwards, since I had the day off work; but there was no showing at a time I could get to that would also be compatible with collecting the kids later.  So it’ll have to wait.</p>
<p>What’s slightly annoying is that yesterday UCI Whiteleys had a showing at 1:20, which would have been perfect; but not today.  So instead I went and had beer.  In a pub.  And lunch.  Ihad to try three pubs before I found one that sold proper beer.  Can you believe it?  What’s West London coming to?  And I read <a href="http://tomorrowelephant.net/">Hannu Rajaniemi’s</a> story from <a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/novascotiarev.htm">Nova Scotia</a>.</p>
<p>Then, since I was in the area, I put The Clash on the MP3 player and went and stood under the Westway.  It was curiously like standing under a big, raised road, surprisingly enough.  Then I thought that standing near a major part of transport infrastruture with backpack on and wires hanging off me might not be very safe these days (can you imagine trying to explain it to some fresh-faced copper: “Honest officer, there used to be this band that lived near here, and they made the… errm… <span style="font-style: italic;">road…</span> famous… Aw look, just stick these in your ears for three minutes: you’ll understand.”)  </p>
<p>So I headed for home.  And now something approaching normal service will be resumed.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I’m afraid I did what the Commissioner told us not to do: I went in to Central London.</p>
<p>See, I live in <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=hackney&amp;spn=0.037118,0.115623&amp;hl=en">Hackney</a>, in the East, but work in <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Wimbledon,+Greater+London,+SW19&amp;spn=0.037220,0.115623&amp;hl=en">Wimbledon</a>, in the South-West.  So I was going to have to go into the centre sometime, to get home.  I just left work early.</p>
<p>The trains were running into Waterloo, pretty much as normal (but largely empty).  Of course, once there, there was no way to get across town: the Tube was closed, and no buses were running in Zone 1.  I took to <a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/316600.html">Shanks’ Pony</a>.</p>
<p>Zone 1 is bigger than you think.  I guess I knew it extended as far as Angel, but it goes all the way up Essex Road.  I ended up getting a bus halfway along the Ball’s Pond Road.  It took me about two and a half hours to get home.</p>
<p>Which isn’t bad, all things considered.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the kids were going home from school with a friend’s mum, so they were fine.  I left early mainly so as not to leave them with her too late.  And of course, to avoid the probable madness of the rush hour.</p>
<p>I am, of course, intensely angry at the scumpigs who would do such a thing.  But on a positive note, a lot of people seemed to be doing the same thing as me, and it was strangely pleasing to see so many people walking through London.  We should do more of it.  And for much better reasons, of course.</p>
<p>I feel I should have more to say, but am blank.</p>

</p><blockquote title="The death of European Software Patents, from BoingBoing" cite="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/06/euro_software_patent.html" style="border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;">The European Parliament voted 648 to 14 to reject the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive.
<p>The bill was reportedly rejected because, politicians said, it pleased no-one in its current form.</p>
<p>Responding to the rejection the European Commission said it would not draw up or submit any more versions of the original proposal. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is excellent news, though as Cory goes on to say,<br>
</p><blockquote title="Cory's comment" style="border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;">Software patents have been staked through the heart before, but they keep rising from the grave. There’s too much monopoly rent waiting to be extracted by anti-competitive companies for them to simply give up and go home. The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.
</blockquote>
<p>A year or so ago the number one or two hit on Google for “software patents” was an article by an old friend of mine, John Gray, who is a Patent Attorney, in favour of them.  With well-reasoned arguments, as I recall.  Sadly the article appears to have gone now, though links to it remain.  Such is one of the weaknesses of the web, unfortunately, when you can’t trust (some) publishers to keep their URLs pointing at something.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://asajeffrey.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">asajeffrey</a> found <a href="http://www.now-business.com/mailinglists/forum/now-forum/showpost?thread=538&amp;mail=26">a mailing list post</a> that, if not John’s article that I was thinking of, certainly discusses the same ideas.  Thanks, Alan.  Note that I am <em>not</em> the “Martin” referred to in that post.</p>

			 <html><body><p>So, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/olympics2012/story/0,14174,1522509,00.html">London gets it</a>.  I was against it, but now I feel strangely pleased.</p>
<p>I think I was for it at first; I really enjoyed watching the Athens Olympics last summer, the kids enjoyed it, and the idea of having one just down the road sounded great.  But then I looked at the plans, and turned against it.  The main reason for my opposition was the effects that I think it will have on the<a href="http://www.lowerleavalley.com/masterplan_ol.html"> Lower Lea (or Lee) Valley</a>.  As far as I can tell, our beloved wilderness will be turned into bland parkland, with the associated loss of wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>However, it may not be as bad as all that, and there’s no doubt that the potential regeneration here in East London — in particular the transport improvements — could be great.</p>
<p>My other concern is, of course, the cost, and how we taxpayers may be paying for it for decades.</p>
<p>But what the hell: my kids will be 15 and 11 in 2012, so it  should be fantastic for them.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Well. I did it: I went to the polling place and I put my cross in the box… for the LibDem candidate.  It’s a very odd feeling, you know, not to vote Labour.  The only time I’ve done it before, I think, was in the first London Mayoral election, when Ken Livingsone was an independent.</p>
<p>I think I might actually have given my first vote to the Greens then, and only my second to Ken (knowing that the first vote would be discarded after the first count, of course).  And I think I also distributed my London Assembly votes between Green and Labour.</p>
<p>Some of the above suggests that I shouldn’t really describe myself as ‘a lifelong Labour voter’, which I tend to; but it’s always been Labour at general elections — until yesterday.  And of course, as I expected, the Labour candidate won.  I’m quite pleased with the overall result, though.  It’s a pity the Tories weren’t squashed like bugs, and the LibDems didn’t do as well as we might have hoped; but at least with Blair’s reduced majority, we might see some reigning in of their madder civil liberties attacks.</p>
<p>And I have Meg Hillier’s email address now, which might come in handy.</p>
<p>The polling place was my daughter’s nursery class — four years ago it was my son’s.  I took them both along with me yesterday evening.  I usually like to vote first thing in the morning, but I had an early start yesterday, because I was collecting the kids in the evening.</p>
<p>They, of course, had a great time being at school out of hours.  I had to wait for ages after voting while they climbed trees.</p>
<p>Then we sat up and watched the results.  Well, fell asleep on the sofa from about 12:30 to 3:00, and then watched until 5:00 or so.  It’s been a long time since I went to bed while it was getting light.  And on a school night, too.</p>

			 <html><body><p>It seems that <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/person/0,9290,-4668,00.html">my erstwhile MP</a> is <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election/comment/0,15803,1470707,00.html">more famous since he stepped down</a> than he ever was in action.  Unfortunately, his jumping ship to the LibDems doesn’t help me with my “<a href="http://www.sonowwhodowevotefor.net/">Now who do I vote for?</a>” dilemma.  If Mr Sedgmore was still standing in <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0,9338,-987,00.html">Hackney South and Shoreditch</a> — for either party — I would happily vote for him.  As it is I have the choice between <a href="http://meghillier.com/">Meg Hillier</a> for Labour and <a href="http://www.libdems.org.uk/party/people/person.html?id=943&amp;navPage=ppcs.html">Gavin Baylis</a> for the LibDems.</p>
<p>I emailed Meg Hillier via her website the other day, and yesterday she actually responded, I’m pleased to say.  You won’t be surprised to hear that I asked about her view on ID cards.  Her answer, unfortunately, was, “I’m toeing the party line.”</p>
<p>Not in so many words, of course; here’s what she actually wrote (in an attached MS Word document, rather than in the body of the email, for some weird reason):</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;"><p>This is now part of the Labour Party manifesto. I am a Labour candidate standing on a Labour Party manifesto. Had I drafted the manifesto it would have had a different focus on this issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm.  So are you against it, or not?  She goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;"><p>There is a long way before current proposals become law, no doubt there will be an opportunity to influence change as the bill progresses through Parliament.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fair point, but does that mean you’ll vote against it? And whether it does or not, can we afford to take the risk that such an attack on civil liberties could be passed in any form? To some extent I don’t fear ID cards and the database state under a Labour government — even New Labour — so much as I do under a possible future Tory government. Imagine for a moment if Britain had had such a setup during Thatcherism, when so many of us were campaigning against nuclear weapons or for the miners, and were generally actively against the government. Or how would MI5 have made use of tools like those, when they were undermining the Wilson and Callaghan governments?</p>
<p>Meg has more modern concerns, though:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;">I have been told that tackling identity theft and child protection would be better served with some form of ID card – I will be looking into this more.</blockquote>
<p>I have been told that when we die we all go to a big palace in the clouds and have wings, but the baddies are still going to be able to forge or steal the cards.  In fact, I think it could make identity theft <em>easier</em>.  People — or at least, institutions — may come to have such faith in database-backed ID cards that the idea of one being in any way <em>wrong</em> will be quite literally unbelievable. The end result will be that, in order to steal someone’s identity, <em>all you need to steal or fake  is one card</em>.  They introduce a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure">single point of failure</a>.</p>
<p>The next MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch concludes:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;">I have no problem with voluntary ID cards.</blockquote>
<p>But it’s only short steps from “voluntary” to “voluntary but required if you want to use a bank account or leave the country” to “compulsory”, it seems to me.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to see that Gavin Baylis is a member of the <a href="http://www.lcc.org.uk/">London Cycling Campaign</a>. Time for an email to him, I think. Followed in a week’s time by a cross in his box.</p>

			 <html><body><p><a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/26082.html">Politics not getting anybody interested</a>, then?  OK, we’ll try religion.</p>
<p>I was brought up a Catholic.  I grew out of it, of course; saw sense, kicked over the traces.  But even when I was a devout Catholic, I think I would have found it very strange, to the point of macabre, to queue for hours to see a recently-dead body; and then to <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=4355784">take photographs of it</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, I’m fairly sure that the Catholicism I grew up with would have frowned on it.  That empty shell is not John Paul II, after all: he has gone on, you know?  Been “called home”, in the words of President Bush (pity it wasn’t him.  But I digress).</p>
<p>Not that I believe in any of that.  I strongly suspect that old Karol has discovered that in the afterlife there is nothing but a purple glow and a humming sound; and that even he isn’t there.  If I remember my Vonnegut aright.  So it goes.</p>
<p>When my Dad died I went to see his body.  At the undertaker’s; in private, with just the family there.  It seemed a normal, natural thing to do.  Sad, obviously, but a part of saying goodbye, of coming to terms with his death.  So I suppose the devout Catholics who are queueing for hours to see the Pope’s body are going through a similar thing; and since he was a public figure, it all happens under the camera’s glare.</p>
<p>But really: they didn’t <em>know</em> him.  He wasn’t family, or a close friend, however important he might be to their faith.  So I can’t help thinking it smacks of <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/thanatophilia">thanatophilia</a>; almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry">idolatry</a>; and I’m sure the church I grew up in wouldn’t have approved.</p>

			 <html><body><h3>… but is that a side order of despair with that, sir?</h3>
<p>Time to start blogging the election, then.  But what to say?  Normally I’d be exhorting you to vote Labour, like in <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.mccallion/pieces/vote.html">1997</a> and <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.mccallion/pieces/vote2001.html">2001</a>; though those were before the days of blogs (for me, at least).  But this year.  This year it’s different.</p>
<p>I could of course warn of the danger of <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_kenmacleod_archive.html#110891596842986311">sleep-walking towards a Tory government</a>, as <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/">Ken</a> did.  And that would be true: there’s no doubt that the Tories would be much worse than Labour or the Lib Dems for the economy and public services.  Plus the idea of it is just <em>repellent</em>; especially for those of us who lived through the Thatcher years.  Who, like me, was politically naive (and fortunately too young to vote) in 1979, and thought something along the lines of, “let’s give them a chance to see how they do”.  And then watched as public services and manufacturing industry were systematically dismantled, as everything good at the heart of this country was attacked by the greedy, money-grubbing scumbags who wanted to turn us into a “share-owning democracy” by selling us the stuff we <em>already owned</em>.</p>
<p>So yes, I could warn about that.  About how Michael Howard was one of Thatcher’s henchmen, about how he presided over the “No repetitive beats” Criminal Justice Act which attempted to criminalise public partying.  About how Howard Flight’s secret revelations are probably understated, and that Tory sleaze didn’t go away after 1997, it just went underground.</p>
<p>But this is 2005, and we don’t have to try to depose a sleazy Tory government any more.  It’s much worse than that.  We have to try to depose a sleazy Labour government; and we have to do it without letting the Tories in.</p>
<p>There is an obvious answer, in theory, at least: we should vote for the Liberal Democrats.  And that wouldn’t be so bad.  I could do that (I might have to).  But the trouble is, most people, disillusioned as they are with the other two, won’t vote for the Lib Dems.  Many people seem to have this strange desire to vote for the winning party.  This is a curious attitude that I have never understood.  Obviously you  want your side to win.  You believe in their policies, or thnk that an individual is the best person to represent your constituency, so you want them to win.  That’s how a representative democracy works.</p>
<p>What I don’t understand is the attitude that seems to say, “I’m not going to vote for them, <em>because</em> they won’t win”.  Well <em>of course</em> they won’t, if nobody votes for them.  But you’re not trying to bet on winner, you’re trying to choose a representative.  It doesn’t matter (in one sense) if you lose; it matters that you vote for what’s right.</p>
<p>The government is crap.  New Labour is crap.  It’s not just Iraq and the whole US-poodle thing; I could see my way past that.  It’s much worse than that.  it’s ID cards.  It’s house arrest.  it’s an attack on civil liberties so extreme that even Thatcher wouldn’t have attempted it.</p>
<p>I live in a <a href="http://sonowwhodowevotefor.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=101&amp;">safe Labour seat</a>.  My MP, Brian Sedgmore, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4292173.stm">kicked government arse</a> in his speech on house arrest.  I could happily vote for him again.  Unfortunately, he’s standing down at the election.  I’ve just being doing some research on his replacement candidate, Meg Hilllier.  She is <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Meg+Hillier%22+id+cards&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N">worryingly silent on ID cards</a>.</p>
<p>I miss old — rather, proper — Labour; I miss having people you might actually want to vote for.  Hell, I even miss 1997-grade New Labour.  I almost miss having <em>Thatcher</em> in power.  At least then it was easy to know who to vote <em>against</em>.</p>
<p>But I wouldn’t want them back.  I’d spoil my ballot before I’d ever vote for those scumbags.  Unless — just <em>maybe</em> unless — they came out against ID Cards.  If they did, though, I wouldn’t trust them. </p>
<p>Never mind a Tory government: we’re sleep-walking towards hell in a handbasket.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Burn (<a href="http://tickettothewest.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">tickettothewest</a>) are back in action.  Yes, after a gap of only just over four months, we have rehearsed again.  Some of you will know that <a href="http://scunner.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">scunner</a>, our former lead guitarist, left to work in Geneva last spring.  We quickly spent several months deciding to recruit another old <a href="http://sesoc.eusa.ed.ac.uk/">Edinburgh SF Soc</a> friend, <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/andismit">Andrew</a>.  We then leapt into action at a rate of a rehearsal every fortnight to three weeks.</p>
<p>Or so I’d have said.  A quick check of last year’s (electronic) diary suggests that our last rehearsal with Ol was in March; and the next rehearsal was in October.  Can we really have left it that long?  Well, maybe not.  We can be fairly sure that the reocord is incomplete, as it only shows one in October and one in November, and I can remember at least three, and I think probably four.</p>
<p>However our most recent was definitely November, which means, as <a href="http://swisstone.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">swisstone</a> said last night, that we would <span style="font-style: italic;">increase</span> our frequency if we went to a quarterly schedule.</p>
<p>Given all that, though, last night went surprisingly well.  We remembered the stuff well, particularly Andrew, who is least familiar with it, and we sounded good: helped, no doubt, by being in <a href="http://backstreet.co.uk/">Backstreet</a>‘s best and biggest room, number 1,</p>
<p>In contrast with the plastic chairs of the other rooms, number 1 has two sofas.  Not that we used them.  Oh no.  We were much too busy rocking out to sit down and take a break.  Honest.</p>
<p>Still, our workrate is higher than that of the Stone Roses, or My Bloody Valentine. Hmm, except that they released albums at the end of it. Oh well.  <a href="http://karmicnull.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">karmicnull</a> suggests a target of a gig by the end of the decade.  I think that’s realistic, don’t you?</p>

			 <html><body><p>A combination of lack of inspiration, Christmas, and reading for and starting my new <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> course, (<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C02A210">A210: Approaching Literature</a>) has made me miss an entire two months of posting. Or almost: I <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/25065.html">posted about HST’s death</a>. Oh well, a roundup here, and I’ll try to do better in future.</p>
<p>The other big time-sink for my evenings recently has been a dangerous addiction. We signed up for <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/">LoveFilm,</a> an online DVD rental service, a few months ago, and soon started catching up on something that we had missed when it was first shown, and never wanted to join in the middle: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/">The West Wing</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing we have recently finished season four, and it has raised the bar so much on TV programmes that I could hardly be bothered to watch the excellent <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/D/desperate_housewives/">Desperate Housewives</a> the other day. Actually, I think it may also be that the latter has gone on too long without having enough to reveal, but we’ll see. </p>
<p>I didn’t call you here to talk about TV programmes, though. Rather, I have a few links to post. First, if you were a fan of John Peel and you didn’t hear it on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/">Radio 4</a>‘s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/nowshow.shtml">The Now Show</a> — or if you did, and want a copy to keep — you should grab <a href="http://www.cybersofa.org/mp3/minutepeel.mp3">A Minute’s Noise</a>, by Mitch Benn.

			 <html><body><p>God motherfuckin’ <em>damn</em>! It’s like everyone I respect or admire in public life is dying these years. <a href="%3Ca%20href=%22#hst1%22%3E">Hunter S Thompson</a> was my favourite non-fiction writer. He was also the most interesting, the wildest, the freeest voice in American poltics — hell, in world politics.</p>
<p>Sure, no-one expected him to last even this long, but what business has got dying <em>now</em>, when the world needs him more than ever? And yes, he was a gun nut: but sometimes its good to know that some of the guns are on the side of right.</p>
<p>I always expected to hear that he’d died from one of his favourite things: you can’t die from writing <sup><a href="#hst1">1</a></sup>; but I always thought it would come from booze, drugs or cars. Or more likely a mixtture of all three. Not guns. And not self-inflicted. Jesus. I expect that we’ll now hear that he suffered from depression, and all the excess was ‘self-medication’. I don’t know. But without the excess I doubt we’d have had the writer.</p>
<p>And what a writer. If I believed in religion I’d say he wrote like an angel; or that it was like his typewriter was wired straight into hades. Instead I’ll just say that he wrote like his life depended on it, and no-one else could touch the clarity and vision he could achieve.</p>
<p>It was always a kind of comfort to know that he was out there somewhere, pounding the keyboard of an IBM Selectric typewriter, Wild Turkey by his side, slapping page after page onto the mojo wire. No longer.</p>
<p>I guess the going got too weird even for that old pro.</p>
<hr>
<a name="#hst1">1.</a> Not directly.  Not in a democracy.  Not in America.<sup><a href="#hst2">2</a></sup>  Though watch out for conspiracy theories over the next weeks and months.<br>

			 <html><body><p>I can scarcely believe it.  Apparently a film is being made of <cite>His Dark Materials</cite>; but <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4077987.stm">according to a BBC news story</a>, <em>they’re removing all references to god and the church!</em>. To paraphrase a comment I read on Slashdot recently, they’re going to have to fit seatbelts in the cinemas for this one, to stop the audience being sucked into the screen by the suckiness of it.</p>
<p>That report itself says:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;"><p>The books tell of a battle against the church and a fight to overthrow God.</p></blockquote>
<p>The film, therefore will tell of nothing at all, it seems.  The reason for this is that</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;"><p>“They have expressed worry about the possibility of perceived anti-religiosity,” Weitz told a His Dark Materials fans’ website.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perceived?  <em>Perceived?</em> Madness. Yet apparently Pullman doesn’t mind. In fact, it also says <q>Pullman has denied his books are anti-religious.</q>  Which, I’m sure, contradicts everything he’s said before.  Incidentally, how do you tell a website something?</p>
<p>In other news, Peter Jackson will be removing all references to the so-called <q>Dark Lord</q> from the <cite>Lord of the Rings</cite> trilogy.   After all, we don’t want to offend anybody, do we?</p>

			 <html><body><p>I'm not doing too well at the 'regular posting' posting part of this blog lark, am I?
<p>Well, I can always blame  <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo </a>for missing November.  I didn&rsquo;t manage to write 50,000 words, but I did manage 20,000, which I&rsquo;m pretty damn pleased about; and I&rsquo;m carrying on with it, too.  Maybe by next year&rsquo;s NaNoWriMo I&rsquo;ll have it finished.  It&rsquo;s strange how a completely arbitrary, but externally-defined, deadline can boost creativity.  In theory I ought to be able to set myself a deadline and get the same effect, but to date I&rsquo;ve never managed to do so.</p>
<p>If 50,000 is a Nanowrimo, though, I declare myself to have completed 40 Picowrimos.</p>
<p>Other news: in a shock move I am close to resolving not to vote Labour at the next election.  If they carry on with their ID cards madness they will have to be stopped.  I intend to write to my MP and to the Home Secretary (who has other things on his mind at the moment, which with any luck will distract him from his authoritarian tendencies).  The former will only have my vote if he promises to vote against the bill at every possible opportunity (and does so).</p>
<p>It will break my heart to put my cross in the wrong box, as well as exposing us to the danger of another Tory government;  but the ID cards scheme — and even more importantly, the database that will support it — is unconscionable . One encouraging thing I saw this morning was the letters page in <cite>Metro</cite>: all the letters about ID cards were against them.  That&rsquo;s a very small sample, but <cite>Metro</cite> is owned by the same group as the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>. If publishers with an authoritarian right-wing background are turning against the idea of ID cards, then maybe they can be stopped yet. You would expect liberterian right-wingers to be against them, of course. I&rsquo;m reminded of one of <a href="http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/">Heinlein</a>&rsquo;s sayings (probably through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Long">Lazarus Long</a>), which I recall as: <q>When a society requires its members to carry ID, it&rsquo;s time to leave that society.</q>  A spot of googling, however, <a href="http://www.bobgod.com/writer/lazaruslong.html">reminds me</a> that it really was:</p>
</p><blockquote style="border-left: 1pt solid; font-style: italic; padding-left: 1em;">When a place gets crowded enough to require IDs, social collapse is not far away. It is time to go elsewhere. The best thing about space travel is that it made it possible to go elsewhere.</blockquote> Oh well.
<p>The <a href="http://www.no2id.net/">No2ID </a>people still have their <a href="http://www.no2id-petition.net/">petition </a>up, so you should sign that if you feel as I do.  And write to your MP.  Or <a href="http://www.faxyourmp.com/">fax them</a>.</p>
<p>If this paternity/visagate business takes Blunkett down, will he take the ID cards bill with him?  I hope so, but expect not.</body></html></p>

			 <html><body><p>I've been thinking about Peelie, and I remembered going to see him live, on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,,857590,00.html">John Peel Roadshow</a>. He used to do the rounds of Britain's colleges and universities.
<p>He came to <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">Edinburgh</a>, possibly every year that I was there, and me and my mates<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><a href="http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/%7Esteve/">Steve</a> and <a href="http://www.buggerdefano.doctorevil.co.uk/">Johnny</a> used to go along to <a href="http://www.cpa.ed.ac.uk/news/info-sheets/12_01_98.html">Chambers Street Union</a> (now vacated, I read at that link) for the occasion. It wasn&rsquo;t quite like listening to his radio show, of course, because he didn&rsquo;t talk that much, and probably didn&rsquo;t play such a wide variety of records. But what you were sure of getting was a club night — or &lsquo;disco&rsquo;, as we used to call them — of absolutely top quality music; and this at a time when the normal club or disco played nothing but absolutely execrable chart rubbish, and had a dress code into the bargain. Some student nights were OK, but once a year there was a night you knew was going to soar.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;ll play &lsquo;Release the Bats&rsquo; if you’ll dance,” I remember him saying.  He did.  We did</p>
<p>One year, when we were sitting in the bar before it started, we saw him sitting across the room, with some people from the union committee. We&rsquo;d have loved to talk to him, but we were too shy to just approach him. So we came up with a plan. Steve and I were on the committee of the Edinburgh University <a href="http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/sesoc/">Science Fiction Society</a>. Why not invent a new class of member, <q>Honorary</q>, to go with the existing <q>Ordinary</q> and <q>Life</q>, and make Peelie one?  So we did.</p>
<p>And still being too shy, Steve and I sent Johnny (who <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> a committee member, remember) over to make him the offer and give him the membership card.</p>
<p>Though unless Steve always happened to have a few spare membership cards on him (unlikely), we must have planned this out in advance, to some degree. Memory plays tricks. Anyway, Johnny reported that he had said he was happy to receive anything that was free, and took the card graciously. I like to imagine that it still lies somewhere in a drawer at Peel Acres.</p>
<p>The only other time any of us spoke to him was afterwards (and Steve wasn&rsquo;t there, so it must have been a different year), when we were hanging around outside, and Peelie was loading boxes of records into his car.</p>
<p>Johnny asked him what his real name was (why, I don&rsquo;t know, and I doubt that Johnny will remember after all these years).</p>
<p>“John Ravenscroft,” Peelie said.</p>
<p>“Oh, I thought it was something else,” Johnny said.</p>
<p>The real triumph, though (and this must have been a different year again, but I can tell you the exact date: 20th January 1985) was when we got a record played for Johnny&rsquo;s 21st birthday.</p>
<p>The Roadshow fell on the actual day, and at some point, one of us (and it was probably Steve, as I don&rsquo;t remember doing it (though he won&rsquo;t either)) went up to the DJ booth with a request. As the night drew to a close we began to fear that he the great man hadn&rsquo;t managed to get to our request. But then, with only around three minutes left, Peelie said, “I&rsquo;ve got a request here that says, &lsquo;Please play something by <a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/skids.htm">The Skids</a> as it&rsquo;s John&rsquo;s 21st.&rsquo;   Well, I doubt it&rsquo;s really his 21st, and I don&rsquo;t have any Skids with me, but John, this is for you.”</p>
<p>And then (at the right speed) came the opening drumbeats of the track that everyone from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/">Radio One</a> to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/default.stm"><cite>Newsnight</cite></a> has been playing in the last couple of days: “Teeenage Kicks.”</p>
<p>And we all danced.  And Peelie went home.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t see its like — or his like, of course — again.</p></body></html></p>

Always on the lookout for something new. always firmly rooted in, and deeply knowledgable about, the past, he was a lesson to us all.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Over the last ten or so years, whenever things have been exceptionally interesting in US politics, I have found myself wondering what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S_Thompson">Hunter S Thompson</a> would say about it. Usually I wouldn’t find out until a year or so later, when his next book came out.</p>
<p>But now we have the net, and in particular, HST’s <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/_/id/6562575?&amp;rnd=1098394261180&amp;has-player=true">latest article</a> in <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a>:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: thin solid; margin-left: 5%; padding-left: 5px;"><p>Did you see Bush on TV, trying to debate? Jesus, he talked like a donkey with no brains at all. The tide turned early, in Coral Gables, when Bush went belly up less than halfway through his first bout with Kerry, who hammered poor George into jelly. It was pitiful. . . . I almost felt sorry for him, until I heard someone call him “Mister President,” and then I felt ashamed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: thin solid; margin-left: 5%; padding-left: 5px;"><p>Richard Nixon looks like a flaming liberal today, compared to a golem like George Bush. Indeed. Where is Richard Nixon now that we finally need him?</p>
<p>If Nixon were running for president today, he would be seen as a “liberal” candidate, and he would probably win. He was a crook and a bungler, but what the hell? Nixon was a barrel of laughs compared to this gang of thugs from the Halliburton petroleum organization who are running the White House today — and who will be running it this time next year, if we (the once-proud, once-loved and widely respected “American people”) don’t rise up like wounded warriors and whack those lying petroleum pimps out of the White House on November 2nd.</p>
<p>Nixon hated running for president during football season, but he did it anyway. Nixon was a professional politician, and I despised everything he stood for — but if he were running for president this year against the evil Bush-Cheney gang, I would happily vote for him.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s <em>Hunter S Thompson</em> saying that. </p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>As a further example of the accelerated time in which we live, it turns out that HST’s latest book is out: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684873192/qid%3D1098214578/sr%3D2-3/ref%3Dpd%5Fka%5Fb%5F2%5F3/026-8616305-5018849"><cite>Hey Rube : Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness: Modern History from the Sports Desk</cite></a></p>

			 <html><body><p>OK, so on Monday I posted the final <abbr title="Tutor-Marked Assessment">TMA</abbr> for my <abbr title="Open University">OU</abbr> course, <cite><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/a103/">A103: An Introduction to the Humanities</a></cite>. It was long, and broad, and mostly very good (though don’t get me started about the History of Science block). So now I have my life back: I can read whatever I feel like reading, and not just coursework and the texts I’m studying; I can write what I want to, and not just the essay for the current assignment.</p>
<p>You have no idea — or rather, <em>I</em> had no idea — how much reading time a thing like that takes up. I do most of my reading while commuting nowadays, and sure enough, I did most of my studying while commuting. An hour each way makes ten hours a week. Subtract the times I didn’t do that, and add in the other time I spent, and I suspect that’s about the average time I spent overall: ten hours a week. Which is probably more than I did as an undergraduate 22 years ago. Well, OK, not counting going to lectures and stuff.</p>
<p><!--more Musings on my academic choices follow...--></p>
<p>Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but these days I frequently wonder whether I did the wrong degree. I’m glad to have a scientific background, and I don’t doubt that it helped me to get job as a programmer; but recently, given that I’ve been doing well on the OU course, I’ve been wondering whether I shouldn’t have done English all those years ago. Maybe, though, I wouldn’t have been so successful at it back then: perhaps I needed the experiences I’ve had over the years before I could tackle the Humanities with enough understanding.</p>
<p>But I certainly think I should have done Computer Science rather than (or as well as) Physics. I did, in fact, express an interest in doing a half course in <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> during my first meeting with my Director of Studies. It wasn’t possible (he told me) to fit it in with the half course in Astronomy that I was doing because I intended to do Astrophysics: they were both in the afternoons (unlike most lectures) and that would have left no time for my Physics lab. I was too shy and unassertive to argue the point; he was too uninterested to discuss alternative possibilities. Note that his role was ‘Director’; not ‘Advisor’ or ‘Counsellor’. Indeed, I put my failure to study CS squarely down to the failure of the Scottish educational establishment of the time to give me any careers advice worthy of the name.</p>
<p>I accept partial blame for the latter failure, of course. At the ages of sixteen and seventeen, when I had what passed for careers advice meetings at my school, I wasn’t in the least interested in having a career (unless it involved rock ‘n’ roll); so I didn’t exactly involve myself in my careers discussions. University was just somewhere to go to get away from home, have money, get drunk, and all the usual student things; plus it was what my parents expected (not so much the getting drunk, etc, bits, but you know what I mean). But you would think that they (the careers advisors) could have worked out (or helped me to work out) that the only thing I really liked at school (I was good at Maths, Physics and Chemistry, and for that matter, not bad at English and Spanish, which werere the Highers I did, but I would never have said I actually <em>liked</em> them) was being in the Computer Club, where we learned to program in BASIC.</p>
<p>It really never occured to me that I could study Computers at University. I knew, of course, that Unis had lots of subjects that we didn’t do at school, but I had no inkling of how you would go about starting one. I guess I was pretty unimaginative in that way. There was one guy in my class who was planning to do CS, but he already knew much more about computers than I did (hell, he even knew some Fortran) so that put me off the possibility even if I did consider it: clearly you had to know much more than me to study such things. I wonder what happened to Billy Gibson; the last I heard he had dropped out of Uni.</p>
<p>If I <em>had</em> done CS, I don’t know that my life subsequently would have been that different. I suppose I might have got a job sooner, since I’d almost certainly have had a better degree; and it’s possible that that wouldn’t have been in London, which could have made a huge difference. But even if that had happened, London had been Calling for a long time, so I’m sure I’d have ended up here eventually. The main thing is whether I’d have been doing a particular philosophy course at the <a href="http://www.citylit.ac.uk/">City Lit</a> at the end of 1992. Not doing that would have made a big, <em>big</em> difference.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Good to see that some people in America remember the Reagan years as we experienced them: <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=online&amp;s=ackerman061404">Reagan’s Punk Rock</a> is an article about the punk bands of the time, and their present-day successors:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: thin solid; font-style: italic; padding-left: 1em;"><p> But no band inveighed against the president with the intensity of the Rock Against Reagan tour’s headliners: San Francisco’s Dead Kennedys. The DK’s first record, <cite style="font-style: normal;">Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables</cite>, was an eclectic and sardonic take on late ’70s California. Reagan drained practically all the subtlety out of the band. In 1981, they released their greatest post-<cite style="font-style: normal;">Fresh Fruit</cite> offering, the raw and furious EP <cite style="font-style: normal;">In God We Trust Inc</cite>.

			 <html><body><p>Who’d have thought Tony Wilson would have been so sensible? Just watching the election results on BBC1, and Anthony H was interviewed in a Manchester bar, saying, <q>Stick with what you believe in … Blair made a terrible mistake in Iraq, and probably even he realises it now … we’ll get a bloody nose, but we’ll still be breathing.</q>  All downright good sense from where I’m sitting.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, I must see <cite>Twenty-Four Hour Party People</cite>.</p>
<p>In my last post I mentioned my <q>uninjured right leg</q>, but I realise that most people reading won’t know about my injury. A couple of weeks ago, on a Saturday morning, I fell down from a raised area in our back garden. I landed with pretty much all my (not insigificant) weight on my left leg. and twisted my knee quite badly. The consultant thinks I’ve busted my <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/18003.htm">anterior cruciate ligament</a>, but I’m still waiting for an appointment for an MRI scan to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<p>So I’m hobbling around with a crutch and a knee brace, mostly annoyed with myself, because if I’d stepped more carefully, or been wearing different shoes, it probably wouldn’t have happened. The offending, extra-slippery trainers have been cast out into the recycling bin where there will be weeping, gnashing of teeth, and, hopefully, recycling. But it’ll be a long time, I fear, until <em>I’m</em> cycling again.</p>
<p>Back on politics, who are these people who, apparently, want Britain to leave the European Union? What kind of madness is that? I mean, aside from the probable contribution of the EU and its predecessors to keeping peace in Europe for the last fifty years, and the advantages I listed <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.mccallion/pieces/vote2001.html">here</a>; aside from all that: who the <em>hell</em> do they think we’d trade with?</p>
<p>They’ve just announced that UKIP have won a council seat in Hull.  Mental.  Ooh, the BNP have <em>lost</em> a seat in Burnley.  Good.</p>
<p>I’m writing this on my <a href="http://www.geek.com/hwswrev/pda/psionser5.htm">Psion</a> (surprisingly hard to find a decent link for that nowadays) while sitting watching the TV. Said Psion broke down the other day. I sent it to <a href="http://posltd.com/">POS</a> in Streatham to get fixed.. It came back today, and it has turned green (from being black before). There was no explanation, but I assume that what they’ve done is, rather than repair my one, they’ve transplanted the guts of it into a reconditioned body. It’s quite fetching, really.</p>
<p>I like the mood of the discussion on election-night programs: it’s serious, of course, but there’s a lightness. You get a bit of banter between the presenters and the guests. Of course, it was a lot bleaker during the dark-blue days of the eighties and early- to mid-nineties…</p>
<p>I don’t understand why there’s so much fuss over the postal ballots this time: we had them for the last two elections here in Hackney (first London Mayoral and local council). This time it’s back to proper polling booths, though. I much prefer it that way. How to increase turnout: let polling go on for, say, three days, and/or make polling day a national public holiday, as someone was suggesting in <cite>The Guardian</cite> the other day.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>It is my custom (or has been at the last two general elections, at least) to broadcast, shortly before an election, to those I know, my thoughts and advice on the forthcoming event.  Should the mood take you, you can look back at what I wrote in <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.mccallion/pieces/vote.html">1997</a> and <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.mccallion/pieces/vote2001.html">2001</a>.  Back then I did it by emailing a load of people.  Nowadays we have blogs.</p>
<p>This time, though, I haven’t managed to get my thoughts out in advance.  Then again, it’s not a general election.</p>
<p>I’ve voted Labour at every election since I’ve been able to vote.  Oh, I think I might have thrown one of my transferrable votes to the Greens in the London Mayoral and Assembly ones last time, but basically its been Labour all the way.<sup><a href="#votefoot1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This time, though, I wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>You know the reasons, I’m sure: Iraq; ID cards; err, that’s enough, really.  Did I still wan’t to support the part that I hadn’t been entirely happy with since it got the “New” tag?</p>
<p>But what are the alternatives?  The Greens, I’ve been thinking recently, are too luddite for me.  Obviously we shouldn’t pollute the environment, and we should do all we can to reduce energy use and carbon emissions; but I fear the Greens are largely anti-technology, and worse, are bordering on the being the type who put animal rights above human rights, which I can’t countenance.  Note that I have no hard evidence to hand for either of those concerns, but I could probably find some with a little research.  if not, and I do them a disservice, well, I’m sure they’ll live.</p>
<p>I thought about the Lib Dems, who are clearly the most pro-Europe of the parties.  I’m sure they’d be fine in many ways.  But in London, for example, they don’t want to increase the size of the Congestion Charge zone.  I think it should cover the whole city.  Or at least come out as far as Hackney.  Anyway, despite my Labour concerns, I was always going to vote for Ken for Mayor again.</p>
<p>I would cut off my uninjured right leg before voting Tory, of course (hey let’s see who says they would scrap the Congestion Charge: Tories, BNP, UKIP; hmmm, is there a common theme there?)  And none of the smaller independents really seem to have it.</p>
<p>Last night I decided. and today I went out and voted.  Labour, in all available boxes.  Because the London Mayor, and Assembly and MEPs aren’t Tony Blair or David Blunkett.  And when it comes to the next general election I’ll probably conclude that Brian Sedgemore, my MP, isn’t them either, and vote for him.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been to your friendly local polling station or postbox today, get on out there.  Remember: all those D-Day heroes that were on the telly recently died so that you could.</p>
<hr>
<a id="votefoot1" name="votefoot1">1</a>. Strictly speaking, voting for Ken for mayor wasn’t a Labour vote, but I think you know where I’m coming from.

			 <html><body><p>In my OU course we’re studying <a href="http://www.wabash.edu/rousseau/">Rousseau</a> at the moment.   So at tonight’s tutorial the tutor asked us to, in groups of three or four, discuss our ideal society.</p>
<p>As the good SF-fanarchist that I am, I suggested<a href="http://www.iainbanks.net/"> Iain Banks</a>‘s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture">Culture</a> as a model.   Not by name, and I didn’t mention spaceships or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_%28The_Culture%29">Minds</a> — we don’t want to raise too many demons at once. I suggsted to the others in my group that a perfect society could only be achieved in a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PostScarcity">post-scarcity</a> environment, with unlimited resources freely available to all.  This led logically to the absence of money and government.</p>
<p>Admittedly I had no mechanism by which this could be achieved, but it was fun to discuss for ten minutes or so.  My group (none of whom I know, really) were surprisingly receptive, though the woman who had been taking notes somewhat misrepresented the points we had discussed when we reported back to the class.<br>
It was disappointing how tame the rest of the ideas were; and what was really surprising — no: shocking — was that one of the other groups suggested increased patriotism as one of the points they wanted.</p>
<p>That’s one of the things they wanted in their <em>ideal</em> society.</p>
<p>More patriotism.  Really.</p>
<p>I kind of wish I’d been (and I’m kind of glad I wasn’t) in that group.</p>

<p>On Friday I made it out to the pub for <lj user="swisstone">‘s birthday drinks, which was reason enough for pleasure and excitement in itself; but it had the added  attraction of introducing me to a number of SF lumminaries and LiveJournal friends for the first time.</lj></p>

<p><em>God</em>, I love politics.  Alas, we won’t get to see a Tory minister squirm over this.</p>
<p>True, perhaps they should have realised it when they did come to power, but a government must be party to a lot of contracts; presumably a new minister can’t go over every single one.  In fact, whoever is in power, isn’t it the relevant Civil Service people who are at fault in case like this?  Including, no doubt, somebody actually in the RAF.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I was going to open this with the old “writing about music is like dancing about architecture” quote, and did a search to find the attribution for it; only to discover that nobody seems to be quite sure.  There is <a href="http://www.pacifier.com/%7Eascott/they/tamildaa.htm">a page where the possibilities are detailed</a>, though.</p>
<p>I’ve always liked to mentally twist the meaning of that quote, and imagine people dancing <em>around</em> a piece of architecture.  But I mention it now because I’m beginning to think it might hold a lot of truth, for me at least.</p>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of my time reading about music, though: all through the punk years I bought <i>Sounds</i>; then after a hiatus while at university I read the <i>NME</i> in the late eighties and all through the nineties.  Even today, I read <i>Uncut</i> from time to time (growing up means switching from a weekly to a monthly schedule: discuss). As well as that, I’ve read a number of musical biographies: The Beatles, The Doors, The Velvet Underground, The Clash, The Stones…</p>
<p>So reading about music is commonplace to me.  Why, then, should I suddenly begin to doubt the worth of writing about it?</p>
<p>Well, it’s this here <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> course I’m three weeks into.  <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/a103/">A103, “An Introduction to the Humanities”</a> covers an unfeasibly broad set of subjects, of course.  The idea is to give us a grounding in various disciplines, and the tools with which to learn to study them.</p>
<p>So far we’ve looked at art history, literature (in the form of the sonnet) and this week, music.</p>
<p>Trouble is, while I found it fairly easy to write about art, and even easier to write about literature (that’s why I signed up in the first place, as I may not have made entirely clear <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/14417.html">back there</a>), writing about music is another matter entirely, I’m discovering.</p>
<p>It’s not that I don’t have the vocabulary: as well as what I know from general knowledge, and what I’ve learned in more years than I care to remember bashing a guitar, I’ve picked up enough in the last week or so to be able to discuss timbre and tempo and texture with the best of them (the best of them in my tutor group, anyway).  No, the problem is that I don’t find music evokes in me the images that other say it does.  Yeah, I can tell when a piece is dramatic or sad, for example.  But when in tonight’s tutorial they played a piece that everyone who commented said made them think of water in some form (except for the woman from Israel who said it reminded her of her national anthem), I just thought it was a kind of not-very-interesting swooshy piece.  It was, in fact, supposed to represent a river — it was a “<a href="http://www.faribaultcatholics.com/church/music/glossaryofmusicterms.htm">tone poem</a>“, apparently.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m unimaginative; but the problem for me, really, is the lack of words.  It’s always been words that have drawn me to songs — in combination with the music, of course: the best words in the world could be ruined by a crappy tune or insipid performance.</p>
<p>But not <em>completely</em> ruined.</p>
<p>I have concluded that most of the reading about music I listed above was actually rather about <em>musicians</em>.  Which is fair enough, but doesn’t help much.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that I haven’t enjoyed the music section so far; just that it’s more challenging than the rest.</p>
<p>But which blows my punk credentials more: having to listen to <a href="http://www.hildegard.org/">Hildegard of Bingen</a> or <a href="http://www.j-tull.com/">Jethro Tull</a>?</p>
<p>Next week: philosophy.  In the meantime I’m off to compare and contrast St Paul’s Cathedral and the Millennium Bridge by means of interpretive dance.</p>

			 <html><body><p>… smells like whitewash to me.</p>
<p>As I watched the details unfold on the <i>The Guardian</i>‘s website yesterday, I began to get a bad feeling about it; and now the details are out, I ask myself this: Hutton is already a lord; what is he getting out of making the government look squeaky-clean?</p>
<p>Now, it’s clear the the BBC screwed up: Gilligan’s first report was overstated, and the management and governors could have investigated its accuracy while still supporting him. A correction, or even retraction, and an apology in the first day or two, and it might all have blown over.</p>
<p>But none of that explains or excuses the dodgy dossier.</p>
<p>Maybe Blair didn’t know the intelligence was bad (can intelligence be stupid? Discuss).  But it <i>was</i> bad, there’s no doubt about that; and Hutton seems to have just excused himself from looking at that area at all. True, his brief was to investigate David Kelly’s death; but that death was inextricably linked with the evidence that was used to justify Britain going to war, and by failing to look at that, Hutton has let us all down.</p>
<p>It’s such a shame, especially since the enquiry itself seemed such a model of openness for the Internet Age.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Somehow they slipped a <a href="http://books.fantasticfiction.co.uk/x0/x4359.htm?authorid=149">new Iain Banks book</a> out without me noticing.  <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1844131955/ref%3Dnosim/authordatabase/202-9480152-3265423">Raw Spirit: In search of the perfect dram</a></i> is his first non-fiction book.</p>
<p>Ostensibly about whisky (more specifically single malts), it is part-autobiography, part-travelogue of Scotland (with a brief dip down to Chester) and a lot about cars and driving.  Rather too much about cars and driving, in my opinion; though it does celebrate Scottish country roads as the best places to drive, which agrees with my own experience and opinion.</p>
<p>And the war, of course: he started doing the research (ie driving around Scotland visiting distilleries and buying whiskies: it’s a hard life as a writer) just as the war was starting, so its events were the constant backdrop to his travels, and he periodically brings them into the foreground.  It won’t come as a surprise to many to hear that his attitude is strongly against the war.  In fact he started his first trip the day he and his wife cut up their passports (which event I may have drawn your attention to before).  </p>
<p>It’s interesting to see that, even when writing non-fiction, Banksie plays the same sort of structural games as in, for example, <i>The Crow Road</i>: he jumps around in time, principally; but it is never hard to follow. </p>
<p>It does, however, show a degree of hurry and under-editing in places; I suspect it was rushed out for the Christmas market, and there are one or two paces where gaps haven’t been properly joined.  The most notable of these for me concerns the apparatus of distilling.  Banks gives us a brief overview of the steps in the distilling process, fairly early on, and then makes appropriate use of the various technical terms during later distillery visits.  All fair enough.  But there is one term for part of distillery’s apparatus — the <a href="http://www.whiskymag.com/words/lyne_arm.html">lyne arm</a> — that he starts referring to without ever explaining what it is (I’m fairly sure: it is possible that I just missed that explanation, but I don’t think so). </p>
<p>However, that relatively small matter aside, it’s a fun read, especially if you like whisky: though as I said above, it’s about a lot more than whisky.  This book will be good for the Scottish economy, I predict: it has already made me drink more whisky, and I’m sure I won’t be alone.</p>
<p>How I came to get a copy is mildly amusing.  I heard about it because they were trailing it as <i>Book of the Week</i> on Radio 4.  Then I saw it in a shop and confirmed that it was by <em>the</em> Iain Banks, but didn’t buy it because Christmas is approaching.</p>
<p>Then we had my team’s Christmas meal at work, and we did one of those ‘Secret Santa’ things.  And my present was… <i>Raw Spirit</i>!  Awesome.</p>
<p>And one last anecdote.  In the unlikely event that anybody will be concerned about spoilers for the ‘search’ in the subtitle, I’ll put it behind a cut.</p>
<p>
<br>
Banksie’s conclusion is, unsurprisingly, that there is no perfect dram, and one person’s favourite will not necessarily be another’s.  However, he does give some opinions.</p>
<p>Probably the one he likes most of all on his travels is straight from a cask at the Ardbeg distillery on Islay.  Unfortunately, it’s a one-off and all the bottles are already spoken for, so it doesn’t really count.  His favourite of all the ones you can actually get turns out to be <a href="http://range.glenfiddich-whisky.co.uk/havana-reserve/">Glenfiddich’s twenty-one-year-old Havana Reserve</a>.  It is aged in Cuban rum barrels.  This makes it illegal in the USA, and so leaves more for the rest of us.</p>
<p>So I was on a work trip to Luxembourg a few days ago, and obviously stopped in at the airport shop on the way back.  They have an astonishingly fine array of whiskies.  And there, right at the end, along with the other Glenfiddichs: Havana Reserve.</p>
<p>A quick phone call (international roaming is a fine thing): “Frances, what do you think of me spending 68 Euros on a bottle of whisky? … OK, you’ll get it for me for Christmas, then?  Great.” </p>
<p>And so it awaits me under the tree.  I’ll report back on Boxing Day (or thereabouts).</p>

			 <html><body><p>I woke up this morning (da da-da da DUN) to what sounded like a Microsoft spokesman explaining on the<i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/">Today</a></i> program, how they were going to break email.  I half feared it, half didn’t believe it.</p>
<p>A bit of research shows me it’s worse than I thought.</p>
<p>Say hello to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3207258.stm">Information Rights Management</a>, and fear.</p>
<p>Apparently this was announced some time ago; I guess I just missed it.  <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=7926">This Inquirer article comes from February</a>, and back in September a site callled <a href="http://www.ospolitics.org/">Open Source Politics</a> discussed the pros and cons in ‘<a href="http://www.ospolitics.org/knowledge/archives/2003/09/05/microsoft_.php">Microsoft Information Rights Management…Threat or Menace?</a>‘ </p>
<p>If there is hope, it lies in two areas, I think.  Open source/free software can be part of the solution, of course.  As the Open Source Politics article suggests, something like this is going to come sooner or later; it just doesn’t have to be Microsoft’s implementation.  In conjunction with that, we have to hope (and exert any influence we may have to ensure that) companies, governments and other Microsoft-using organisations realise that this move may welll decrease their data security and increase the degree to which they’re in thrall to Microsoft.  With such realisation they might kick Office 2003 into the long grass, where it belongs.</p>
<p>Otherwise it might be time to start saying goodbye to the Information Age as we have known it, and hello to the age of total information control.</p>

			 <p>Now, more than ever, I realise that we&rsquo;ve lost one of the greats.</p>
<p>We all blogged <a href="https://devilgate.org/2003/09/08/warren-finally-gets.html">Warren Zevon&rsquo;s
death</a>, but now I want to
write an appreciation of him. This may turn into a rant against death
and the loss of the greats, but if so, so be it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seven o&rsquo;clock, Eight o&rsquo;clock, Nine o&rsquo;clock, Ten<br>
You wanna go home?<br>
Why? Honey, when?<br>
We may never get this chance again!<br>
Let&rsquo;s party for the rest of the night!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got his last two albums a week or two back, and they haven&rsquo;t been out
of my personal CD player since. I&rsquo;m listening to <em><a href="http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/z/zevonwarren-myrides.shtml">My Ride&rsquo;s
Here</a></em>
as I write this. At least as I start it. I&rsquo;ll probably have alternated
between it and <em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/reviews/story/0,11712,1040070,00.html">The
Wind</a></em>
a few times before I finish.</p>
<p>He died at the top of his game: the three albums that closed his career
contain some of the best things he&rsquo;s ever done: <em><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=28286">Life&rsquo;ll Kill
Ya</a></em>, <em>My
Ride&rsquo;s Here</em> and <em>The Wind</em>. I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s ever &ldquo;a good
day to die,&rdquo; or even, really, that you can have a &ldquo;good
death&rdquo;. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a thought for another day. The point here is that Warren died
having completed his final album, said goodbye to his family, friends
and fans, and even seen the latest James Bond film. If you&rsquo;ve gotta go,
it&rsquo;s better than most of us can expect. Unlike <a href="http://www.strummersite.com/">Joe
Strummer</a>, for example, who <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/2002/12/23/">died at the
tail end of last year</a>,
and who was taken from us totally by surprise: he wasn&rsquo;t sick, and
no-one expected it; and he had no chance to finish things. Which is how
most people die, of course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eleven o&rsquo;clock, Twelve o&rsquo;clock, One o&rsquo;clock, Two<br>
Me, tired? Well boo hoo!<br>
I&rsquo;m starting to fall in love with you<br>
Let&rsquo;s party for the rest of the night!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like to think though, that, despite all that, Warren went raging
against the dying of the light; and &lsquo;<a href="http://www.poplyrics.net/waiguo/rock/warrenzevon/133.htm">The Rest Of The
Night</a>&rsquo;, from
his last album, is the perfect roar of defiance to hurl at the darkness.
Yet at the same time it shows some of the resignation, or acceptance, we
see on some of the other tracks, such as &lsquo;<a href="http://www.leoslyrics.com/listlyrics.php?hid=9ywHWfdU4T4%3D">Keep Me in Your
Heart</a>&rsquo;.
Many have described the latter track, which closes the album, as the
most affecting song on it; and I can scarcely listen to it without a
lump coming to my throat.</p>
<p>Yet &lsquo;The Rest Of The Night&rsquo; is the song that, for me, captures the
end-times nature of the album more than any other.</p>
<p>As a straightforward party anthem it&rsquo;s right up there with Springsteen&rsquo;s
&lsquo;<a href="http://www.lyricsdomain.com/lyrics/31082/">Mary&rsquo;s Place</a>&rsquo;, from last
year&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/">The Rising</a></em>. (The comparison
is particularly apt, because Springsteen provides guitar and backing
vocal&rsquo;s on <em>The Wind</em>&rsquo;s other rabble-rouser, &lsquo;Disorder In The House&rsquo;.)
But it&rsquo;s in the context of his impending death that &lsquo;The Rest Of The
Night&rsquo; really takes wing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may never get this chance again&rdquo; is the key line here. Of course,
considered rationally, that is true of any of us, any time, about any
experience; Zevon must have felt it very keenly, though, whether or not
he was well enough to party.</p>
<p>Then the line, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting to fall in love with you&rdquo; suggests that,
even as &ldquo;the old whore death&rdquo; was hovering in the background of his
life, Warren was still willing to take a chance on the great
rollercoaster ride that makes life even more worthwhile.</p>
<p>The song has a similar effect on me to the film <em>Dead Poets' Society</em>,
with its advice to &ldquo;seize the day&rdquo;: it makes me want to grab hold of
life with both hands and hang on for the ride. Because we&rsquo;re only on
this Earth for a short time, we don&rsquo;t get a second chance, and (I
believe) there&rsquo;s nothing afterwards. We may <em>not</em> have this chance again
&mdash; whatever it is &mdash; so let&rsquo;s throw ourselves into it now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three o&rsquo;clock, Four o&rsquo;clock, Five o&rsquo;clock, Six<br>
Let&rsquo;s throw it all into the mix<br>
And open up our bag of tricks,<br>
And party for the rest of the night!</p>

			 <html><body><p><lj user="steer"> has <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/steer/68269.html">already discussed this in some detail</a>, both in the post and the comments, but I started writing this before I read his, so I’m going to allow most of it to stand.</lj></p>
<p>Derren Brown’s <a href="http://channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/D/derren_brown/">Russian Roulette</a> was a fascinating study in psychology and showmanship.  When he pretended he though the bullet was in chamber five and aimed down the room and we heard the <em>click</em>; the few minutes of silent anticipation that followed seemed like hours, and had me on the edge of my seat.</p>
<p>This despite the fact that I was (and am) sceptical about the possibility that he could come to any harm.  I don’t know how (any more than I know how that Copperfield guy flew a couple of hours later (this should include a link to Channel 4′s ‘Top Fifty Magic Tricks’, but I can’t find it on their site)), but I’m sure there was no way he could possibly have blown his brains out.</p>
<p>The strange thing for me was that, since he showed right at the start, with the cup game, essentially how he was going to work out which was the deadly chamber; and since it was clear in that cup game example that the guy hesitated slightly before he said the number of the cup in question; I expected to be able to tell which chamber held the bullet.</p>
<p>However, they guy who loaded the gun (James?) was so nervous that he raced through counting one to six, with only, I thought, a slight hesitation on six.</p>
<p>But he’d loaded chamber one.</p>
<p>Is it just me, or does anyone else think that’s an incredibly weird number to choose?  My mind was screaming “four”, but that’s probably because it was cup four in the cup game earlier.  But to put the bullet in the first chamber.  I don’t know: what if Brown had decided just to start at the bottom?</p>
<p>More significantly, how did Brown catch the hesitation in James’s voice when it must have come on the first number spoken?  Make it hard for the guy, why don’t you, Jimmy.</p>
<p>And what does watching that kind of spectacle do to us as viewers, to television as a medium?  In Saturday’s  <i><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a></i>, Mark Lawson route about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1055685,00.html">potential death as media spectacle</a>, saying:<br>
</p><blockquote>Our culture is now so tricked out with smoke and mirrors that were Brown to fall to the studio floor under a gunpowder cloud – or, indeed, if David Blaine was carried out of his glass box in a wooden one – we could not be certain that we were really seeing what we thought we saw. In the spun world, the illusionist just joins a queue behind the politicians and other tricksters. In such an environment of lies and winks, the media need to set rules of truthfulness and keep to them.
<p>If Brown really is risking his life tomorrow night, then it’s a moment of landmark depravity for television. But, if he really isn’t, then it’s a lesser but still terrible offence against the integrity of the medium. </p></blockquote>
<p>And now I find that in today’s, he points out the twistedness of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1056879,00.html">David Kelly/Samaritans/Russian Roulette</a> segue.  I feel slightly unclean.</p>

			 <html><body><p>I started reading <i><a href="http://www.novelguide.com/janeeyre/">Jane Eyre</a></i> for the first time the other day.  It’s been in my to-read pile for a couple of years at least, but you know how it is: there’s always something else; something more cutting-edge, more up-to-the minute.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>People, the fucking <em>preface</em> alone is one of the finest pieces of writing in the English language: jam-packed with wisdom for our time and all times.  George Bush should be made to read it.</p>
<p>But don’t take my word for it; go on over to <a href="http://promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenburg</a> and read <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext98/janey11h.htm">the start of their version of Jane Eyre</a>; it won’t take long.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~matsuoka/EG-Charlotte-1.html">Charlotte Bronte’s</a> <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/cheryb/women/Emily-Bronte.html">sister’s</a> masterpiece, <i><a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/cgi-bin/sdb/t9.cgi?entry=768&amp;full=yes&amp;ftpsite=http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/">Wuthering Heights</a></i> is the only book that’s ever made me miss my stop on the train on the way to work.  Proof, perhaps, that genius can run in families; or that a similar environment can produce similar results.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <html><body><p>A while back <a href="http://scunner.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">scunner</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.emusic.com/">Emusic</a>, an online site where, for a monthly fee, you can download as much music as your bandwidth can cope with.  It’s all legal and above board: the artists get royalties per download, and all in all it seems like a fine model for how music can be distributed.</p>
<p>Obviously not every artist on the planet is going to be on there, so it can be kind of disappointing sometimes.  However, the kind of artist that is there (in my brief study of the matter) is kind of off the wall, left field stuff that maybe doesn’t get major mainstream distribution.  The sort of stuff I tend to like, in other words.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have no problems using Mozilla at their site, and their download manager is available for Linux as well as Windows.  They just <em>get it</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>So I just started a trial subscription period: fourteen days, fifty files.  Plenty to choose from, and it’s all going very well.</p>
<p>Or it was, until I started seeing this message appear alongside some albums: <i>Not available outside North America due to licensing restrictions</i>.</p>
<p>And this is alongside, for example, <a href="http://aasearch.emusic.com/aasearch?rtype=search_art&amp;searchterm=the+birthday+party&amp;cid=emusic&amp;imageField.x=0&amp;imageField.y=0">everything they have by The Birthday Party</a>.  Bugger.  Bastards.</p>
<p>I’m expecting comments from <a href="http://scunner.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">scunner</a> and <a href="http://swisstone.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">swisstone</a> about this, because they specifically said that <a href="http://www.emusic.com/cd/10601/10601119.html"><i>Lazy Line Painter Jane</i></a> by <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/10514/10514569.html">Belle And Sebastian</a> was on Emusic; and it is: a Scottish band, not licensed outside of North America.</p>
<p>So does anyone know how to get round this?  I could change my registered country to the US, but it would cause some problems as my credit card billing address, I fancy.</p>
<p>Though its not like they’re sending anything…</p>

			 <html><body><p>Maybe it’s a mid-life crisis kind of thing.  As my thirty-ninth birthday rolled around the other day — thereby taking me into my fortieth year — I decided that it was time to do something I’ve been vaguely thinking of for quite a while.</p>
<p>So I’m going to start studying with the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk">Open University</a>.  And as a Physics graduate, and long-time programmer, obviously I’m going to study <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/subjects/humanities_page.shtm">Humanities</a>.  Specifically, in February I’m going to start <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C02A103_humanities">this course</a>.  Before that, though, in November, I think I’ll probably do this short one: <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C02A172_humanities">Start Writing Essays</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in years to come, there are courses in <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/subjects/literature_page.shtm">Literature</a>, <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/subjects/music_page.shtm">Music</a>, <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/subjects/history_page.shtm">History</a>, all kinds of stuff.  Even <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/subjects/computing_page.shtm">IT</a>, should the mood takes me; though I suspect that OU courses may be less than cutting-edge in that area.</p>
<p>Which only leaves the inevitable question: since I don’t have time to do all the stuff I want to now, how the hell will I find time to do this?</p>

<p>Which was quite limiting, but also interesting.  We hadn’t rehearsed at all in nearly a month, and our last fully-plugged one was on the 8th of April, if my diary is to be believed.  So we were, to say the least, rusty.  It was appropriate, then, that we should close with ‘<a href="http://home.teleport.com/~jfitz/words/powder.html">Powderfinger</a>‘, since that comes from <i><a href="http://www.inkblotmagazine.com/rev-archive/Neil_Young_Rust.htm">Rust Never Sleeps</a></i>.</p>
<p>And indeed it doesn’t.  But still, we did some good work.  Memories were refreshed and songs were practised.  We showed a definite pattern of “play it badly, try it again, play it better; sometimes repeat.”  Which is as it should be, of course.</p>
<p>It was good to be back in <a href="http://www.backstreet.co.uk">Backstreet</a>, with its strange, mouldy, under-the-railway-arch smell; it was good to crank the guitars up and let rip; and it was good to drive there on a sunny evening with all the windows open and <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/">Bruce Springsteen</a>‘s <i><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=41566">The River</a></i> blasting.</p>
<p>I arrived at the studio just as ‘<a href="http://people.fm.uniba.sk/veres/mp3ii/hungry_heart.htm">Hungry Heart</a>‘ was playing, which was appropriate, as we considered covering it once, when we heard that Springsteen originally wrote it for <a href="http://www.officialramones.com/">The Ramones</a>.</p>

<p>From the few comments I had read while trying to avoid spoilers , I had got the impression that people thought the action was good while the philosophy was overdone — not blended in as well as in the first film, I believe was the sense of it.  This was utter bollocks.</p>
<p>In fact, if anything the fight scenes, etc, were too long — though I did find myself chortling with glee throughout several of them.</p>
<p>If we hadn’t had to get back to kids and babysitter, I would have been in favour of going back in for the 11pm show — which is something I’ve never done.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Shortly after I posted it, I realised that <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/devilgate/12304.html">my previous post</a> could be taken as a “comedy mishearing” — and indeed, it duly was so taken.  That’s not what I originally intended it as — and indeed, if I had, it wasn’t very funny.</p>
<p>No, when I started writing it, I was genuinely wondering what Robert Johnson was talking about.  Why was he thinking about methane?  Could he, perhaps, have been interested in the search for life on other planets, where the existence of methane might suggest the existence of oxygen-breathing life?</p>
<p>Or might he have been using a methane-burning stove?  A dangerous and unpleasant cooking solution which might well have weighed on this thoughts and made him think of rambling.</p>
<p>Or perhaps “methane” was code for a drug or sexual practice — we are talking about the 1930s US, after all: a less enlightened time and place than our own.</p>
<p>But the dreary reality was that I had misheard “mean things”.  Perhaps when I discovered that I shouldn’t have posted; but I was only a click or two away and it’s hard to stop.</p>
<p>Still, it all gave <lj user="zoo_music_girl"> and </lj><lj user="zotz"> the chance to have a little chat, and for the latter to point us to <a href="http://www.kissthisguy.com/">Kiss This Guy</a>, where some of the mishearings actually are funny.</lj></p>
<p>Anyway I hope that this has made it clear that I wouldn’t waste precious posts on such a thing as a comedy mishearing.</p>
<p>At least, not unless it was funny.</p>

			 <html><body><p>… and it still is.</p>
<p>(I’ve been drafting this piece for a while, and I’ve done as much as I’m going to .  It’s been a bugbear for a long time, and it’s time to put it out there.)</p>
<p>Anyone who bought records during the eighties and probably early nineties, at least in the UK, will be familiar with the propaganda I’m referring to there.  At some point during those years, the record companies, in their wisdom, decided that the common practice of people making tape copies of their friends’ records (or records borrowed from libraries) was seriously eating into their profits, and had to be stamped out.<br>
</p>
<h3>Hoist the Joyless Roger</h3>
<p>Part of their programme to achieve this aim was the printing, on all album inner sleeves that didn’t have pictures or lyrics, of the slogan “Home taping is killing music” above a large skull-and-crossbones with the skull formed from the silhouette of a cassette.  Below this device was the text, “and it’s illegal”.  You can see a reproduction of it <a href="http://www.stunned.org/mt/archives/000015.html">here</a></p>
<p>Obviously, when first the young, would-be home taper saw this, they immediately gave up their nefarious acivities, destroyed any tapes they had already made, and went out and bought all the albums they had taped.</p>
<p>Oh no.  Sorry: that was just in the dreamworld of the record company executives.</p>
<p>Is any of this — even if you’re too young to remember those days — starting to sound vaguely similar to events in our present (and more recent past)?</p>
<p>The parallels with MP3 sharing are undeniable; but are the conclusions the same?</p>
<h3>Divided but undimmed</h3>
<p>Before I consider that, let me just say why I think home taping was/is good for music.</p>
<p>The fundamental point that the record companies never got, I think, was that records taped <em>were not lost sales</em>.  Taping was always a poor second-best to having the record.  I speak here from the point of view of a teenager at school, of a student, of a young adult on the dole: mostly we taped records that we wanted to hear or have, <em>that we couldn’t afford to buy</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine, for a moment, that taping had never existed: that records had been released, but that there was no technology available to individuals that would allow a copy to be made.  Would we — would <em>I</em> — have bought all the albums that, in reality, I taped?</p>
<p>I think it’s easy to see that the answer is “no”.</p>
<p>I might have <em>wanted</em> to, of course; but there’s no way I’d ever have been able to afford to.</p>
<p>So I, and thousands — maybe millions — like me, made tapes.  And in doing so, I got to know the music of the bands I liked.  And what do you do if you like, say, a band’s first two albums, which you have on tape, when their third album comes out?</p>
<p>You buy it on record, of course.</p>
<p>Especially if, by that time you are working and generally financially better off.  This is exactly what happened to me with, for example, The Pogues.  I heard them on John Peel, taped the first two albums (from <lj user="swisstone">, as it happens) and gradually fell in love with them.</lj></p>
<p>Then when their third album came out, I bought it.  Same with their fourth and fifth.</p>
<h3>Make the switch</h3>
<p>But it gets better than that, as far as the long-term income for the band (and record company) is concerned (or at least it did during the years of vinyl’s fading and aluminium’s growth).  Because tapes degrade; after a few years of heavy use, they sound shite, quite frankly.  But of qcourse, the music they hold doesn’t; our love for the songs doesn’t.</p>
<p>Sooner or later you need replacements.</p>
<p>This is why I have the first two Pogues albums on CD and the remainder on vinyl.  Same with others.  Or take The Fall: I have a mixture of vinyl and CD, and a still incomplete collection.  Keep them out there, the record companies, and eventually I’ll buy the missing ones.  On CD, almost certainly.</p>
<p>I am, of course, a trivial statistical sample; but I strongly suspect that I’m a long way from unrepresentative.</p>
<p>So my conclusion is that my taping activities didn’t deprive the artists or record companies of any sales; and <em>did</em> prepare me to buy the material later.  A net gain for artists and record companies.  And for me, for that matter: a no-lose situation.</p>
<h3>It’s got to be perfect</h3>
<p>But things have changed — or they might have at least.  Nowadays you can borrow a CD and make a CD copy of it: a bit-perfect, nondegrading copy (on the assumption that CDR doesn’t degrade, which is another story entirely).  Or you can rip it to your hard drive.  The MP3 encoding is of a lower quality than CD, of course, but most of us, most of the time, probably can’t tell the difference; and if it doesn’t bother you — or once you get used to it — again, there’s no deterioration.</p>
<p>This all, I must admit, bothers me.</p>
<p>Clearly there’s no problem with ripping your own CDs, for convenient playback.  Ripping, or copying, borrowed ones, though: there’s the rub.</p>
<p>Because it completely blows my repacement theory out of the water, doesn’t it?  You’ll never replace your copied CD, because it’ll never become muffled and stretched like a tape.</p>
<h3>Rip it up and start again</h3>
<p>Well… I can think of a couple of occasions where you might go back and buy a copied or ripped CD.  One is to get the packaging.  A not completely unreasonable possibility; many albums are attractively packaged, with lyrics, sleevenotes, and so on.  But in equally many, even ones that contain glorious, deathless music, the packaging is at best an irrelevance (and I’ve long felt that twelve-inch vinyl records are better to own <em>as artifacts</em> than CDs anyway; not least because of the bettter printing quality on the bigger covers).</p>
<p>The second is when you’ve ripped it and you lose the ripped files through a disk crash or similar (in conjunction with poor backup discipline, of course).  Indeed, there is a growing belief or acceptance that “the CD is your master copy” while your working copy resides on your hard drive, or in your iPod or whatever.</p>
<p>So, it’s not impossible that we may go on to buy a once-borrowed CD.  But I think it’s a lot less likely than it was with tapes.</p>
<p>So where do I stand on copying CDs?  is home duplication killing music?  Well, no: it’s clearly not as bad as that.  I’m not totally comfortable with duplication, so I rarely do it.  The fact that people out there will, however, doesn’t mean that the whole edifice of the music industry is going to come crashing down any time soon.</p>
<h3>Stay tuned for more rock ‘n’ roll</h3>
<p>Indeed, the other side of the digital music revolution probably balances out the problem of making copies: downloading.  The record companies don’t get this yet,of course, but on the whole I think even they will have to admit that downloading is good for music.</p>
<p>This argument has been discussed to death on the net, so I can hardly bear to write it, but in a nutshell: you dowload — legally or not — a few tracks by an artist; if you don’t like them you never listem to them again and/or you delete them to save space.  If you like them, you go out and buy the album.  It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>OK, there are alway exceptions.  There are no doubt people who’ll be prepared to take the time to download entire albums; but they’re surely in the minority.  For most people the download model will, or does, work broadly as I’ve outlined it above.</p>
<p>Also, I’m fairly sure that most people will be willing to pay a small fee to download tracks, once a suitable payment mechanism is found.  So all in all music-downloading culture is good for music — especially, of course, for the smaller artist without big record-company backing.</p>
<p>All of this has been said before, and will be said again (for example, <a href="http://www.netmusicians.org/mp3_death/Mp3_death.htm">this guy</a> presents a good discussion of it); we’ll have to keep saying it, I suppose, until the record companies listen — or until they just go away and leave bands to get on with doing it themselves.<br>

			 <html><body><p>Too many people to mention been filling in “what I did n years/days ago” questionnaires (I hesitate to call it a meme, because that word is becoming so overused).  And who am I not to join in?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>20 years ago:</strong> Just starting second term of first year at Uni.  Hadn’t been to Eastercon — hadn’t been to a con yet: RaCon was later, I think; and anyway, a good Catholic boy like me had been at home with his parents, going to midnight mass and all that.</p>
<p>However I had got into SF fandom, via the <a href="http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/sesoc">EU SFSoc</a> (of which I was later President, for what it’s worth).  Had started making several of my closest friends, whom I’m don’t stay in nearly close enough touch with these days.  Must have seen the Architects of Fear (seminal Edinburgh punk band, without whom <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/tickettothewest">Burn</a> would probably not exist) a few times by then.  It was through SF Soc that I met <lj user="swisstone"> and, indirectly, because they were a bit after my time, </lj><lj user="karmicnull"> and Ol (my turn to say, “Get an LJ, mate”).</lj></p>
<p><strong>15 years ago:</strong> I had started work in London the previous August (and  had a long-weekend trip to Brighton for reasons many of you will remember, if vaguely).   Exactly fifteen years ago I had probably recently returned from Follycon.  I was living in Tooting with some members of a band called The <a href="http://www.mp3.com/pleasurethieves">Pleasure Thieves</a> — they had some fine songs which I remember fondly (so I was pleased to find, while researching this, that they’ve put a lot of them out via MP3.com).</p>
<p>Also in the same house was their <a href="http://www.thegliders.co.uk/biog.html#Andy">recently-left singer</a>. He left because the other band that he was involved with had recently got a deal.  Tensions were high, but largely unspoken.  The Jazz Devils put out a couple of albums on Virgin, but they had never played a gig before they got their deal so they had no following.</p>
<p>The Pleasure Thieves regrouped as a three-piece and gigged heavily over the next couple of years.  I sometimes helped them out with a bit of roadieing.</p>
<p>Later that year I bought a house in Walthamstow with two friends called John (if any of these people had sites I’d link to them).  Big mistake financially, given what was to follow, but we had a fun few years including putting a band together for a bit.  Never got past the rehearsal-room stage, though.  In fact, we never even settled on a name.  We tried out many, with The Void being the last and longest-serving, but we were never very happy with it.</p>
<p>I wonder now whether we’d have done more if we’d had a name.</p>
<p><strong>10 years ago:</strong> still in Walthamstow, but by this time the house-partnership was sundering — amicably enough: it was all to do with other relationships starting.  By this time I had met and was going out with Frances, (whom I’ve been with ever since), so I was spending a lot of time in Hackney, too.</p>
<p><strong>5 years ago:</strong> Daniel, our son, was 1.  Living in Hackney, commuting to Wimbledon.  Holidayed in Normandy, on a farm where there was a donkey which Daniel loved at first, but then got frightened of when it charged down the hill braying loudly (safely behind a fence, I should add).  I had hardly touched my guitar in several years, but Burn were in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Last year:</strong> Fiona, our daughter, was 1.  We were starting,very gradually, to get the house done up, a long-term project.  I had been in Burn for four years, I think.  Holiday in France again, camping in the Loire Valley this time.  No donkeys seen.</p>
<p><strong>Yesterday:</strong> At work: tail end of Meridian 4 development (soon to be shelved as we redevelop it using EJBs — though that release will probably still be numbered 4).  Collected kids, Frances working late.</p>
<p><strong>Today:</strong> At work again; more of the same.  band rehearsal at Ol’s tonight: mmm, pizza, beer.</p>
<p><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> It’s the working week, what do <em>you</em>. think?  Don’t expect the Mayday celebraions to affect me much, though work have warned us to be careful, “to avoid accidental involvement in violence”.  Yeah, but what about deliberate involvement?</p>
<p><strong>Next year:</strong> should repeat this, to build up a year-by-year picture.</p>

			 <html><body><p>This week I’m on a training course: <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/">Enterprise Java Beans</a>, at <a href="http://qa.com">QA Training</a>.  On the first day, the trainer, as is usual at these things, asked us each to say a few words about ourselves, our expectations of the course, and so on.  “And as a bit of light relief, your favourite book”.</p>
<p>I said, “I don’t believe anyone really has a single favourite, but one that I especially like at the moment is <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747234825/qid=1051133772/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/026-1985933-1122808">Hyperion</a></i> by <a href="http://www.dansimmons.com/">Dan Simmons</a>.”</p>
<p>“Do you like science fiction generally?” asked the trainer.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Do you know of an author called <a href="http://johnmeaney.tripod.com/">John Meaney</a>?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I just read his <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553505890/qid=1051134488/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_3_1/026-1985933-1122808">Paradox</a></i>,”  I answered, thinking he was a fellow fan.</p>
<p>“He’s teaching <i>Java for C Programmers</i> upstairs.”</p>
<p>FX: Martin’s jaw hitting desk.</p>
<p>The out-of-context setting and surprise of it all left me feeling strangely star-struck — despite the fact that I haven’t actually met him, just spent a couple of days in the building where he works.  I shouldn’t be affected like this: I’m an old conventioneer, after all.  And indeed, half (or more) of my potential readers here were probably drinking with Mr Meaney last weekend in Hinckley; but still…</p>

			 <html><body><p>So it’s begun.</p>
<p>I haven’t posted about the formerly-impending war here before now, not because of any reticence, but because <a href="http://www.geocities.com/keentonyuk/">faster</a> (and better) <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/plaidder/">writers</a> than me have <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/03/19#waggingTheTaleOfWar">already</a> said <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/yonmei/39609.html">anything</a> I would <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blosxom.cgi/2003/Mar/18#wartime-14">want to say</a>.  And we don’t want to get into “me too” syndrome, now, do we?</p>
<p>But I can’t let it pass without comment.</p>
<p>Today, as well as hearing about the first  strikes on Iraq, we are being warned of the likelihood of increased terrorist risk now that it’s started.  So finally somebody in authority <a href="http://www.skirsch.com/politics/iraq/Lessons911.htm">gets it</a>.  Pity they didn’t get it soon enough to tell the US (or even UK) government.  Because you can be sure that we (by which I mean the whole world) are entering a time of increased danger from terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Not just over the next few week or months while the war actually happens, though: we are now likely to be entering a terrorist decade; maybe century.</p>
<p>Of course, as <a href="http://www.rawilson.com/main.shtml">Robert Anton Wilson</a> put it (or maybe he was quoting somebody) “Terrorist is what the big army calls the little army.”</p>
<p>And the biggest army of them all is going to cause the most terror.  Though they might call it “shock and awe”.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Infrequent posts are me.  But I have been scattering comments around various people’s journals, at least.</p>
<p>Zotz <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=zotz&amp;itemid=66143">posts</a> about The (remaining members of the) MC5 <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,912932,00.html">playing a Levis-sponsored gig</a>.  I have to say that I’m not sure how I feel about this.  I know I <em>ought</em> to feel upset that they’ve ‘sold out’ but I just can’t seem to get up the ire.</p>
<p>Perhaps I’ve become too accepting of the capitalist society in which we live.  But it’s not like they’re being sponsored by a weapons manufacturer — or even McDonald’s or Nestlé, for that matter.</p>
<p>Not that Levis are likely to be angels, but I just wonder whether we should cut the MC5 some slack: why should we hold them to a higher standard than we hold ourselves? (and we all work for corporations or governments, ultimately, don’t we?)</p>
<p>At this point, though, I worry that I may be contradicting the spirit of <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.mccallion/pieces/vote.html"> something I wrote a few years ago </a>, just prior to the 1997 UK General Election.  in essence, there, I said that becoming a parent hadn’t made me more conservative, but if anything politically the opposite.  This relative acceptance of selling out to corporate interests could easily be perceived as a step in the conservative direction.  And maybe that’s so.  But from where I’m sitting, it’s not me that’s changed, but everything else.</p>
<p>That sounds horribly solipsistic, but the political landscape <em> has </em> changed a lot in this country in the last five or six years.  Though, if everything has moved right, that should leave the good Marx-fearing socialist<sup><a href="#PoliticsFoot1">*</a> </sup> appearing to be even further left: unless they have been dragged with it.</p>
<p>Which means my parenthood piece’s assertion is contradicted; but it’s not because of parenthood.  The question I have to consider is whether I <em>want</em> to be dragged around by society.</p>
<p>I should just add at this point that I feel that I was in no way moved to the right by the supposed move right of society during the Thatcher years.  Obviously it takes a ‘Labour’ government to do that.</p>
<p>Then at the same time, Karmicnull <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=karmicnull&amp;itemid=7836">tells us</a> that Warner Hodges out of <a href="http://www.jasonandthescorchers.com/">Jason and the Scorchers</a> has formed a <a href="http://www.disciplesofloud.com/">new band</a>.  This is a surprise, because I thought that a) he’d quit the music business, saying he didn’t really enjoy making music, and b) there had been a Scorchers tour planned, which was still sort of in a state of ‘might one day come to fruition’ if he ever did come back to it.</p>
<p>Still, people change (and moving ones do too); so what seemed right once may no longer seem so (and of course, having one band doesn’t preclude the possibility of playing in another; just ask Blixa Bargeld, for example).</p>
<p>The common theme here seems to be, ‘people change’.  And in direct opposition to almost everything anyone ever says about that subject, I <em>like</em> change.  Life is change: if you’ve stopped changing, you’re dead.</p>

			 <html><body><p>See, I like my job.  I know this is considered unusual by a large percentage of the population <sup><a href="#step-change-foot1">*</a></sup>.  But on the whole I do.  I’ve had my ups and downs, of course, but I wouldn’t have stayed there for fifteen years, through name changes and takeovers, reshuffles and redundancies, if it wasn’t a reasonable place to work; and I wouldn’t have gone into that area, and stayed in it — not to mention resisted all inducements to move into management — if I didn’t like the work.</p>
<p>I’m a programmer, which, in my humble opinion and personal mythology, is the third best job in the world (and I do the top two in my spare time anyway: see my bio).  So when, some fifeen years ago, the precursor of the company that I now work for offered me a trainee programmer job, I, having been on the dole for a year since graduating, was delighted.  Not only was I starting a programming job, but also I was moving to London, which, despite burning with boredom, had been calling to my faraway town for a long time.</p>
<p>My personal graph of contendedness and the ups and downs of the job market combined to ensure that I stayed there ever since.  I have occasionally looked around for another job, but never quite got round to moving.  At the time when I was furthest down that line, for example, I was offered a move to a more interesting role, so I stayed.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, senior management announced the latest round of redundancies (I wrote a blog piece about it, which, for various reasons, I never posted).  That safely behind them, they feel they have to justify their existence by doing the latest spot of restructuring.</p>
<p>The division I work in is being split into three independent (allegedly autonomous) operating companies.  This comes some eighteen months after all the prior companies (the group grew by acquisition) were renamed and rebranded under the group name and logo.</p>
<p>Both the rebranding and now the split can be seen as good decisions in business terms, and there are some aspects of the latest split that seem positive from where I’m sitting.  But here’s the rub.  Each of the new companies is to have its own HR and Finance departments.</p>
<p>Now, I’m sure if you asked the board they would tell you that they had no plans to sell off any of the companies; and they probably wouldn’t even be lying; but could it be any plainer that they’re positioning things such that they easily <em>can</em> sell off the various bits if they’re seen to be performing poorly?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company in which I am to find myself has announced the following facts (among others):</p>
<ul>
<li> it’s going to become a nicer place to work </li>
<li> they’re going to tighten up on the dress code </li>
<li> they’re going to tighten up on timekeeping (which had, over years, become informally flexible) and definitely <em>not</em> introduce flexitime </li>
</ul>
<p>I invite the reader to join me in musing about the incompatibilities in the above statements.</p>
<p>Oh yes: and they’re going to improve communications; but they announced all the above without the vaguest hint of consultation with the staff.  No, wait, this is management-speak: “communication” means “We will communicate at you”.</p>
<p>And on that note, all this is being badged the “Step-Change Program”.  Now I don’t know about you, but to me a step-change sounds like quite a small thing; like a stepper-motor in electronics, maybe, or just the first steps of a child.  Apparently not to management.  In management-speak, our new boss (same as the boss before the current one, as it happens) tells us, “step” means “huge”.</p>
<p>Do what you want with the company, guys: but give us our language back.</p>

			 <html><body><p>You know I said a while back that, though <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=devilgate&amp;itemid=6558">I hadn’t yet done a lyrics quiz, I would</a>?  Well, the more observant among you may have noticed it appearing right under your noses, gradually, in the very titles of these posts.</p>
<p>Yes, eight of the posts since I started this have titles that are quotes from popular (or not so popular) songs.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to identify the posts and the source of the quotes.  It should mostly be pretty easy (<i>I</i> think).</p>
<p>As an extra clue, the song in question (if not the quote itself) always has some relevance to the content of the post (now <i>there’s</i> a way to get people to (re-)read my posts).</p>
<p>Go on, give it a try.  I bet Swisstone has got the first one already.</p>
<p>This will probably be ongoing, with periodic roundups.  And anyone who says, “Martin can’t think up decent titles of his own,” will probably be agreed with.</p>
<p>I noticed this morning that, judging by her titles, Purplerabbits seems to be doing the same sort of thing.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Duct tape.  I ask you, when, in this country, did we start calling gaffer (or gaffa, I’m never quite sure) tape, ‘duct tape’?</p>
<p>The answer seems to be about two or three days ago.  Certainly <i><a href="http://guardian.co.uk">The Guardian</a></i> is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,894334,00.html">blithely referring to it</a> as if we talked about it every day.</p>
<p>And anyway, what ducts exactly is said famous tape intended for?  It holds cables to floors, patches up guitar cases and even amps; but what ducts?</p>
<p>Thing is, I realised in these troubled times that all <i>my</i> ‘duct tape’ is at Karmicnull’s, since our <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/tickettothewest">recording sessions</a>.</p>
<p>The Nulls, of course, live out in the countryside, many miles from civilisation; so perhaps their need for taped-plastic-sheeting protection is greater than we inner-Londoners.  But I doubt it.</p>
<p>Anyway, it gave me the idea for another of my obscure post-titles, which, if you haven’t worked out the purpose of yet, I’ll explain in my next post.</p>

It’s called <i><a href="http://www.wordmagazine.co.uk/">Word</a></i> and it’s about books and music and videos and popular culture in general.  It may be of particular interest to certain LJ users (hi Zoo_music_girl, hi Zotz) because it has interviews with Nick Cave (he’s on the cover) and John Peel.  I haven’t read much of it yet, but it looks pretty good, despite the unfortunate Microsoft-application-name-overlap</p>
<p>Its kind of exciting to get issue one of something; it’s a long time since I did anything like that.</p>
<p>In a bit of a newsagent spree, I also bought the <i><a href="http://nme.com/">NME</a></i>, which I used to get religiously, but haven’t done so for a few years now.  This week’s comes with a free CD of NME Awards nominees, which is pretty good.  Slightly strangely, it closes with The Clash’s ‘Complete Control’.  So I now have that on CD, as well as 7″ black vinyl picture sleeve.  Ha!</p>

			 <html><body><p>I spent all of Friday afternoon trying to track down (what should be) the last bug in the project I’m currently working on.  Only to discover that it wasn’t really there.  Grrr.  I must have looked at the wrong output when I ran the relevant test just before lunch, so I thought I wasn’t getting the data that I should be.  Then after I got back from Pizza Express (it was Friday after all) I started debugging.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the afternoon deep in the bowels of <a href="http://borland.com/jbuilder/">JBuilder</a>, stepping through the code in debug.  Then just as it was getting close to being time to go home, and when I thought I was going to have to come back to it on Monday, I discovered that there wasn’t any bug at all: I was getting the data that I expected.  Grrrr.  And Grrr! again.</p>
<p>Still, at least I <b>did</b> get it sorted out before the weekend.</p>
<p>For some of the time I was listening to a band called <a href="http://www.islandrecords.com/rustedroot/index.las">Rusted Root</a>, who are a kind of folky, percussive lot.  One of my co-workers had them on his hard drive, and he had thought that <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=tickettothewest"><img height="17" border="0" src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" align="absmiddle" width="17"></a><b><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/tickettothewest/">we</a></b> might sound a bit like them, purely going on the “cowpunk” description (and knowing next to nothing about punk, clearly).</p>
<p>So I pointed him at the <a href="http://hovell.com/Muse/">mp3s of our old demo</a>.  It stems from before <lj user="swisstone"> and I joined the band, but we still do the first two songs (and might conceivably reinstate two of the others into our repertoire).  He’s an open-minded sort of guy, and is keen to hear the results of our recent sessions.</lj></p>

			 <html><body><p>Spent the weekend at <lj user="karmicnull">‘s doing some recording.  See the band’s blog at </lj><lj user="tickettothewest"> for blow-by-blow details (with pictures), but here’s my take on it.</lj></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We were up till one on Friday night doing initial setup and soundcheck for my guitar.  Got my rhythm (god, that’s a stupid word to spell; I always take about three goes, and it still never looks right) guitar for ‘Naples’  down in the first hour or so on Saturday morning.  There’s a part in it where all of us are having difficulty locking into the beat correctly (note how I avoided using that word again).  This was where <lj user="swisstone"> demonstrated that a drumstick could become a conductor’s baton.   All these years we thought he was air-drumming, and here he was really practising to be a conductor.</lj></p>
<p>Actually it was very helpful.</p>
<p>We then decided we needed a different sound for the next song, ‘Massachusetts Avenue’.  And spent the next hour playing with gain and EQ controls until we had it right.  Karmic is nothing if not a perfectionist, and I’m sure we’ll thank him for it when we hear the final results.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we were able to use the same sound for the third song, ‘Cowboys and Indians’, and it went down without too much fuss, leaving us only to choose a suitable clean sound for ‘White Line’.  That didn’t take too long,and before the night was out Ol, the lead guitarist (and sole non-LJ user in the band, I might add) had done his rhythm part on the last song.</p>
<p>The next day he did all his other rhythm parts, and in the afternoon I started singing.</p>
<p>That’s when we discovered all the parts in the songs where I had been getting it wrong up until now.  I didn’t write any of the songs we’re recording at the moment, so there’s always someone else to know what I’m doing wrong (in many ways this makes it easier for me than doing my own songs, when there’s only me who knows what I should be singing); however, it’s not always easy to catch such things in a rehearsal when everyone is playing.</p>
<p>Still, as <lj user="zotz"> said, taking two hours to record the entire lead vocal for a track is not, in the grand scheme of things, that much.</lj></p>
<p>In the end, though, we only managed to finish three of the four tracks before we all had to go home, so ‘Naples’ remains undone as yet.</p>
<p>And in the middle of all that we heard the tragic news about <i>Columbia</i>.</p>

			 <html><body><p>How crap is that?   I was cycling to Waterloo this morning, on my brand-new, four-month old <a href="http://www.ridgebackbikes.co.uk/">Ridgeback</a> bike, when all of a sudden something began to drag badly on the back wheel.  I got off, had a good look, up-ended it, and saw that the tyre was rubbing against the mudguard bracket, once per turn.</p>
<p>I tried slackening the wheel and re-seating it, but that didn’t help.  The mudguard bracket wasn’t bent or anything.  I gradually realised that the wheel was out of true.</p>
<p>But it had happened in an instant; I had heard the change, just as I went over a speed bump.  Surely wheels only get warped over a long period of time?</p>
<p>A few more minutes of examination revealed the culprit: a spoke had broken.  The careful balance of tension that makes a bike wheel the perfect, dynamically stable circle that it is, had gone, throwing all out of alignment.  I feel there should be some sort of metaphor here, perhaps for world affairs; but this isn’t <i>Thought for the Day</i>.</p>
<p>So I was left to take it easy the rest of the way to Waterloo,  and I’ll have to struggle home somehow.</p>
<p>Fortunately (I suppose) the bike is overdue for its first free service, so I’ll take it into <a href="http://www.londonfieldscycles.co.uk/">the shop</a> and I’m sure they’ll sort it out.  But after only four months?  It’s very disappointing.  It’s not like it’s seen very heavy use: twelve miles a day on only two or three days a week on average, and I didn’t use it at all in December.</p>
<p>And it would have to happen <i>this</i> week, when the Central and Waterloo &amp; City Lines are fracked because of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/leaders/story/0,3604,883586,00.html">crash</a>.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Further to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=devilgate&amp;itemid=6927">yesterday’s post</a>, I have to express extreme, pleased surprise and respect at how well the tax return site worked.  After my post yesterday I tried again, but went back a few extra steps.  I think the fact that I couldn’t get back directly to the page I’d been on was due to some wrinkle with the HTML form that the page was using.  I went back to the start and went forward again; all the data I had entered was still there (apart from on the page I was on when there was a server problem, but that was easy to re-key).</p>
<p>I finished entering the rest of my data (after spending more time than I should have had to tracking down some of the documents I needed) and got to the end, and pressed the button saying, “Calculate my tax”.</p>
<p>That’s when I got the biggest (and pleasantest) surprise of all: it seems <em>they</em> owe <em>me</em> two hundred and twenty quid!</p>
<p>As a socialist, of course, I approve of paying your taxes; though like anyone, I wasn’t looking forward to the possibility of having to pay some extra.  But I never imagined for a a second that I’d get a refund.</p>
<p>Thing is, I don’t even understand <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>Who’d have thought that doing your taxes could be both so easy and so lucrative?</p>

			 <html><body><p>It’s the first time I’ve had to fill in a tax return since I was a student, and I decided that, in the 21st century, it’s almost a moral requirement to do it onlline if you can.  I was prepared to fall back on IE if I had to, but I have to express a certain surprised respect that the <a href="http://www.ir-online.gov.uk/">online form</a> seems to work in Mozilla.  As a precaution, before I started I disabled my ad-and-popup blocking software, <a href="http://www.adsubtract.com/">AdSubtract</a>, as it can cause problems with functional sites if they happent to use much JavaScript.  But then the site just worked.  Errr, until it ground to a halt, that is.</p>
<p>Now, you’d think that they’d have realised that the last weekend that you can do your return before you get a penalty charge would be on the busy side, and boosted their severs a bit.  But no.  There it sits, hours later, on an ” operation timed out” page.  <em>Sombeody</em> must be connecting, but it sure ain’t me.  Even <a href="http://netcraft.com/">Netcraft</a> can’t connect (I thought it would be worth finding out <a href="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?mode_u=off&amp;mode_w=on&amp;site=ir-online.gov.uk&amp;submit=Examine">what kind of servers they’re running</a>; but I don’t know yet).</p>
<p>Oh well, I have to get some info from my building society before I can finish, so I suppose it can wait.</p>

			 <html><body><p>It’s a truism that time appears to pass faster as we get older.  Just how true this is was brought home to me anew when it crossed my mind that I had, a while ago, been thinking about writing a piece with a similar title to the above.</p>
<p>Then I realised that I had been thinking about it around <i>last</i> New Year.  Yet it felt to me like it had been no more than a few weeks before.</p>
<p>Then on Radio 4′s <i>Today</i> program, before I left for work this morning, they were doing a piece on time-saving devices, and how some people think that they don’t save us time, but merely free us to waste it in new ways.  And how we’ve lost the sense of <strong>process</strong>.</p>
<p>To paraphrase:</p>
<blockquote><p>We travel only to be at our destination, not to experience the journey; we treat food as something to eat, not something to cook; we wash merely to have clean clothes or dishes, not to get them clean.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is all very well, but what exactly is the problem with that?   Especially in the case of the last point: I’d say, “Damn right” to that one  The single best household good we ever bought was the dishwasher.</p>
<p>As for travelling, well <strong> of course </strong> we do it to be at the other place.  For example, I went to <lj user="karmicnull">‘s with Frances and the kids for New Year, and the purpose of the travelling was only so that we could be with our friends.  If I could have stepped onto a transporter platform and beamed there in an instant I’d certainly have done so in preference to experiencing the dubious pleasures of the rain-drenched M11.</lj></p>
<p>On the other hand, I do enjoy cooking, but what with work and kids and <nobr><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=tickettothewest"><img height="17" border="0" src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" align="absmiddle" width="17"></a><b><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/tickettothewest/">band</a></b></nobr> there’s little enough time for home life.  And at the same time, it’s slightly ironic that they should run that piece just a week after many if not most people in the country have spent a day cooking (or helping to cook) the biggest meal of the year.</p>
<p>Here’s a thought: if, on Christmas Day, you could press a button and instantly have a classic Christmas dinner ready, with no preparations and no cooking, would you?  I think I probably wouldn’t.  Because part of the whole Christmas experience is the preparation and cooking.</p>
<p>Though I would certainly use such a magic button at other times…</p>
<p>With the year-change bringing thoughts of time, the other time-related quote I was thinking of using as a title was, “Time takes a cigarette”, from Bowie’s<br>
‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Suicide’.  Then what do they go and use as part of the backing for the Radio 4 piece?  Plagiarists!</p>
<p>It was an interesting piece, though, and I would have liked to listen to all of it; but I was already late leaving, and so (of course) I didn’t have time.</p>
<p>And last year’s piece?  Inevitably I never found the time to write it.</p>
<p>
In a nice touch of real-world LiveJournal linking, just after the year turned at Si’s, we got a phone call from <lj user="swisstone">.  Which was nice.<br>

			 <html><body><p>Joe Strummer died yesterday.</p>
<p>For me, the word “hero” is not too strong.  The Clash were my favourite band of all time, and I’ve continued to follow his solo work.  He’ll be sadly missed.</p>
<p>There are two spooky coincidences about this two me.  First is that I heard about it in a text message from <lj user="swisstone">.  This is a strange, sad echo of his <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=swisstone&amp;itemid=47047">recent posting</a> in which he dreamt that he texted me about discovering a Clash gig at a con.</lj></p>
<p>The second is that yesterday, I set up my turntable for the first time in several months.  The second record I played was <i>Combat Rock</i>.</p>

			 <html><body><p>Or maybe that should be, “when do we forget?” or, “When do we let it lie?”</p>
<p>I was thinking about the Saatchi ad agency, and how all decent people in Britain despised them throughout the eighties and nineties, because of their work in getting the Tories into power, and keeping them there.</p>
<p>You may remember how, just a year or two ago, <a href="http://www.soft.net.uk/theziggy/books/ibanks/">Iain Banks</a> admirably refused to go to some awards ceremony or other, because it was being held at the Saatchi gallery.  “Words matter,” said the writer, correctly<a href="#foot1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was that phrase that started this whole train of thought.  On leaving work I noticed what I thought was one of the many casual misspellings that haunt our public spaces.  In this case it was on a London Borough of Merton electronic noticeboard by Wimbledon station.  “Run with the Wimbledon Windmilers”, it said, and I wondered whether it was a pun on the distance they run.  Wimbledon has a windmill, though, and I somehow doubted that members of an athletic organisation would be that keen on wordplay.  A quick websearch showed me that <a href="http://www.windmilers.org.uk/">I was wrong</a>, though.</p>
<p>Indeed, I imagined a literate member of the organisation complaining about it to their colleagues, and being told, “It doesn’t matter: it’s only a word”.</p>
<p>But it’s their name.  And names matter.  Words matter (the fact that I was mistaken, and there was no misspelling doesn’t matter, for the sake of this argument).</p>
<p>So when <strong>should</strong> we let the Saatchis — or at least their name — back into polite society?  It’s hard to say; and not an immediately pressing matter, as I have no particular desire to visit their gallery, nor a need for an ad agency.</p>
<p>It’s not like that first time I bought South African wine after apartheid ended.  That was both difficult, and positive.  Difficult because I had developed such an ingrained reaction against South African goods; and positive because I could feel I was supporting the new regime.</p>
<p>That, of course, was several orders of magnitude more significant than the doings of a seedy little political party and their advertising lapdogs (hmm, I wonder whether the lapdog relationship was actually the other way round?)</p>
<p>I suppose, though, if it comes to making the decision, I should ask myself, “What would Iain Banks do?”</p>
<p><font size="-1"><br>
<a name="foot1">[1]</a> Though I have to admit to doubting my memory when I find that Google can find no record of this event, either on the web or on Usenet.  And, as I always say, if Google can’t find it, it’s probably not there.<br>

			 <html><body><p>I used to go to <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">Edinburgh University</a>.  For the first two years I was nominally doing <a href="http://www.roe.ac.uk/">Astrophysics,</a> until it proved too difficult, and I backed off to do plain <a href="http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/">Physics</a> (which, in turn, I only just managed to pass; but that’s another story).</p>
<p>In our house we’re regular watchers of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/whatson/search/advance_search.cgi?title=1&amp;keyword=university+challenge">University Challenge</a>.  So imagine my excitement last night when Edinburgh were on with a team of scientists, including two astrophysicists.</p>
<p>And  imagine my embarassment when they were roundly trounced by a team from Southampton.</p>
<p>It did seem slightly ominous when Paxo specifically said that they were weak on arts.  It’s common for arts-heavy teams to be weak on science; but I’ve never seen a team of scientists that were so bad on arts.</p>
<p>Actually I don’t think I’ve ever seen a UC team that was all scientists before, but I’ve never <strong>met</strong> four scientists who knew so little bout the arts.</p>
<p>Maybe standards really are slipping?  Or maybe today’s science students just aren’t reading enough <a href="http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/sesoc/">Science Fiction</a>.  Who knows.  Though by the look of that last link, even SFSoc don’t read much now.</p>
<p>Incidentally, when I was there, we didn’t have any of those websites.  Because we didn’t even have the web.  Seems hard to imagine now…</p>

			 <html><body><p>The waiting emptiness of a new blog is even more intimidating than that of a blank page.  Especially when, as with LiveJournal, there's an already-existing community who all seem to know each other.  It's a bit like it must be to go to an SF convention when you don't know anyone.
<p>I once saw a guy in the bar on the Saturday night at a con, (I think it was that Eastercon in Docklands) sitting on his own, <strong>wearing a walkman</strong>.  He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I want to be here, but it&rsquo;s so hard to get in that I might as well make my own entertainment.&rdquo;  I kind of wanted to ask him to join our group, but I didn&rsquo;t, partly because of my own reticence about approaching a stranger (and fear that I&rsquo;d end up having to babysit a weirdo for the rest of the con, if I&rsquo;m honest) and partly because, of course, the other thing his walkman was saying was, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t want to be saying that, so I&rsquo;ve got all the comment options enabled.  And fortunately I know <em>swisstone</em> and <em>zotz</em>.  So that&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>My reasons for joining the blogging revolution (not that I need to give any) are: ego (I want to be like <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blosxom.cgi">Charlie Stross</a> or <a href="http://boingboing.net/">Cory Doctorow</a> or <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls</a>) and not wanting to miss out on a bandwagon (if I can paraphrase the <a href="http://www.billybragg.co.uk/">Bard</a> (of Barking): &ldquo;So join the struggle while you may/The Revolution is just a text editor away&rdquo;).</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been meaning to set up a personal website for ages anyway.  And one day I still will.  But in the meantime (and after, in all likelihood) I&rsquo;ll publish anything I want here.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention.</p></body></html></p>

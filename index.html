			 <p>This morning I read the whole of the<a href="https://archive.is/J31rj"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vulture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article about Neil Gaiman</a>. That link&rsquo;s to an archived copy, because someone said on Facebook that the original has had the references to Scientology removed because of legal threats. And also it&rsquo;s paywalled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so depressing that a man who seemed so decent, so generally a positive force in the world, can turn out to have been an abuser all these year. Allegedly, I suppose I must say.</p>
<p>You know, Paul Cornell included Gaiman as a character in one of his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shadow Police<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stories, <a href="https://devilgate.org/2014/10/12/the-severed-streets.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Severed Streets<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>. If I remember the &lsquo;Neil Gaiman&rsquo; character was a villain. We took it as fun at the time; but I wonder if Cornell had an inkling that he wasn&rsquo;t the nice guy he seemed.</p>
<p>In other shitty-men news, Matt Mullenweg has been blowing up most of the good feeling people have about WordPress over the last few months. I&rsquo;m glad I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/04/09/website-changes.html">moved my site off it a few years ago</a>. But now he&rsquo;s <a href="https://heatherburns.tech/2025/01/12/another-day-of-stochastic-harassment-for-old-times-sake/">attacked a woman who used to work on WordPress</a> but hasn&rsquo;t for years.

<p>Just being shitty.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780735273344">Conclave</a> by Robert Harris 📚</p>
<p>After my recent <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/12/15/conclave.html">viewing of the film</a> based on this, my daughter got me the book for Christmas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising how compelling a book can be when you know exactly what&rsquo;s going to happen, and it&rsquo;s about something that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally give a toss about. Though on the latter, I suppose the boy can leave the church, but it always leaves its mark, or something.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out this Harris guy can really write. Who&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve thought?</p>
<p>I note with interest that the &lsquo;why this story, why now&rsquo; question that I mentioned when writing about he film, never even crossed my mind while reading this. I approach a book with a different set of expectations from how I do a film, maybe.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593470954">The Bridge of San Luis Rey</a> by Thornton Wilder 📚</p>
<p>Finished reading several weeks ago, in fact. I&rsquo;m way behind with the change of year.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is an odd little book. I stress the &lsquo;little&rsquo; because it&rsquo;s very short. We&rsquo;re in Peru. An ancient rope bridge, of Inca origin, collapses one day, killing the five people who were crossing it. A priest, Brother Juniper, witnesses the event and decides to use it to prove God has a plan for humans.</p>
<p>The narrator, however, tells us that Juniper&rsquo;s eventual vast book on the subject was derided, destroyed, and in any case incomplete. The narrator knows things about the people that Juniper never learned. How the narrator knows these things is never stated — we might assume it&rsquo;s because the narrator is also the author, though that&rsquo;s rarely a safe assumption.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the start. The rest of the book consists of the stories of the victims and how they came to be there on that day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. Won the Pulitzer.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784971625">Death&rsquo;s End</a> by Cixin Liu, Translated by Ken Liu 📚</p>
<p>I laugh gently at <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/11/08/finished-reading-the.html">my past self</a>, musing that this volume, based on its title, might have a <em>less</em> bleak universe-view.</p>
<p>Reader, it does not.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s the thing I liked least about this whole trilogy, the dark view of the universe, of sentience. The idea that every species that develops intelligence and advances to the point of thinking about space travel and the idea of possibly communicating with other intelligent species; that they would all have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide">xenocidal</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> instinct. Have it, and routinely, casually act on it, by wiping out the star systems of other species they detect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it couldn&rsquo;t be so. As one explanation for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi paradox</a> it&rsquo;s exactly that: one explanation. But it&rsquo;s just too fuckin <em>bleak</em> for my tastes.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this story, and the trilogy as a whole, is jam-packed with ideas, stuff about relativity, higher and lower dimensions, all sorts of good hard-SF stuff. The characters are kind of blank, undeveloped: I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be sticking in my memory. But I enjoyed it overall.</p>
<p>Apart from when I was annoyed/disturbed/upset by the dark forest idea.</p>
<p>Your central idea: I do not like it.</p>

			 <p>I was shocked, but not exactly surprised, by the US election result. Or no: I was surprised. I think I had somehow internalised that idea that Kamala Harris would win. It seemed unthinkable that Americans would elect Trump again.</p>
<p>But then, it seemed unthinkable that they would elect him <a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/01/20/trumpeting.html">the first time</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised though. Among the presidents in my lifetime, we&rsquo;ve had Nixon, Reagan, Bush, and W Bush. All of them considered to be dangerous warmongering borderline fascists at the time. And/or comical and incompetent choices, to consider Reagan and W Bush, specifically.</p>
<p>Yet America elected all of them (notwithstanding that the popular vote nearly always favoured their Democratic opponent).</p>
<p>Trump, of course, rolls the ills of all of them up into one great ugly package, and adds narcissism on top. And the times could hardly be worse for women in America in particular, with reproductive healthcare under attack with the overturning of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Roe v Wade<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>What can you do, though? Life goes on. We&rsquo;ll get through it, except for those of us who don&rsquo;t.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784971618">The Dark Forest</a> by Cixin Liu, Translated by Joel Martinsen 📚</p>
<p>This is somehow much less obscure and strange than <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/10/20/finished-reading-the.html">the first one</a>. I don&rsquo;t know how much that is to do with it having a different translator, but it&rsquo;s possible. The third one is back to Ken Liu, who translated the first one, so maybe we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>The other odd thing is that when I added this to Micro.blog&rsquo;s Bookshelves feature, it came up with a subtitle I&rsquo;ve never heard of before: &lsquo;Remembrance of Earth’s Past, #2&rsquo;. On the book&rsquo;s title page, and in any other discussion I&rsquo;ve heard of, it&rsquo;s always referred to as &lsquo;The Three-Body Trilogy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Getting to the story itself: perhaps the least believable thing about the whole thing is the idea humans could be convinced to believe that an alien invasion force was on its way to Earth and would arrive in 450 years. To believe and act toward resisting the force or ameliorating the situation by escaping or anything else.</p>
<p>I mean, in the real world we can&rsquo;t even get people to believe in, get governments and businesses to act on, the climate emergency, and its effects are visible day by day.</p>
<p>The climate is largely ignored in this book, as well, though in the latter part, set two hundred years after the start, we see some extreme desertification in China.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty bleak in places, in its philosophy, this one; especially as regards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi paradox</a>, or a solution thereto. But it leaves us at a point where I&rsquo;m thinking, &lsquo;Where now? That feels like a decent ending.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Death&rsquo;s End<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (great title, and potentially a much less bleak philosophy, if it matches the title) is sitting waiting, all 700+ pages of it. Why does each volume of a trilogy tend to be longer than the one before?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> So we&rsquo;ll see where that takes us.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this. There&rsquo;s a lot of telling, and the characters maybe aren&rsquo;t very clearly differentiated, but it&rsquo;s full of ideas.</p>

			 <p>It seems Facebook still has the odd use, apart from keeping in touch with family and friends who still use it. I popped in late last night, and it told me I had memories on this day. It seems the 29th of October has been a day on which I&rsquo;ve often posted in the past, because there were several. But the one that really caught my eye was this one:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>15 years ago, it tells me, in 2009, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason Ringenberg doing The Clash&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ivan Meets Gl Joe&rsquo;: a thing of rare beauty. Spotify URI: <a href="http://is.gd/4Hcr7">http://is.gd/4Hcr7</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s quite telling, in several ways. First of all, remember the <code>is.gd</code> URL shortener? Remember <em>URL shorteners that aren&rsquo;t <code>t.co</code></em>?</p>
<p>Also, I haven&rsquo;t used Spotify in a long time, being a happy Apple Music subscriber. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter. What&rsquo;s really weird is that I have absolutely no memory of Jason (out of Jason &amp; the Scorchers, as I&rsquo;m sure you know) doing any Clash song, much less a surprising choice of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandinista<!-- raw HTML omitted --> album track.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> And back then was probably still in the time when was listening to Jason quite a lot.</p>
<p>Obviously I quickly searched for it on Apple Music. To find that it&rsquo;s part of an album. Not one by Jason, though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/2107226-Various-The-Sandinista-Project-A-Tribute-To-The-Clash">The Sandinista! Project</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> is a compilation album of covers of the entirety of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandinista<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by different artists.</p>
<p>Why was I not told such a thing existed?</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that I <em>was</em> told of it, one way or another. Some passing mention, a mental note, quickly forgotten… maybe it was mentioned in Jason&rsquo;s newsletter or some such.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not a totally off the wall idea. It&rsquo;s subtitled &lsquo;A Tribute to The Clash&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;ve had or listened to things like it before. I had something called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->London Booted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> once, which was sort of techno-ish covers of some or all of the tracks from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->London Calling<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And I remember listening to a reggae version of that album, or tracks from it, at least.</p>
<p>But this is every track on what is famously a triple album. Yes, including &lsquo;Career Opportunities&rsquo; (though not, to be fair, &lsquo;Blowing in the Guns of Brixton&rsquo;). And the great thing about it is, almost no track is a carbon copy of the original. We get jazz instrumentals, ska versions, rocked-up versions of ones The Clash took slowly, and everything in between. Most of the performers are little known, or unknown, to me a least. But we get Katrina of Katrina and the Waves, Jon Langford of the Mekons, Wreckless Eric, The Coal Porters, and of course the aforementioned former Scorcher.</p>
<p>It is really, really good. Highly recommended if you&rsquo;re a fan, and even if you&rsquo;re not, I imagine you&rsquo;ll find something to enjoy. Go on, <a href="https://album.link/i/256099883">find it on your favourite service here</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I love that the label it&rsquo;s on is called 00:02:59 Records. &lsquo;The band went in/And knocked them dead/In two minutes fifty-nine,&rsquo; as &lsquo;Hitsville UK&rsquo; says.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784971540">The Three-Body Problem</a> by Cixin Liu , Translated by Ken Liu 📚</p>
<p>Spoilers below.</p>
<p>This is a really strange book. I know it&rsquo;s probably cultural differences in storytelling style, and what have you. But there is something deeply odd about the way this is told. I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on what it is (and at least part of it will be to do with the translation).</p>
<p>At a plot and character level, one thing that surprised me is that when someone starts seeing unexpected visual effects — specifically, a countdown timer superimposed on the world around them — they don&rsquo;t ever seem to think that the explanation is they&rsquo;re actually in a simulation. That would seem like the logical first attempt at an explanation, given the recent history of SF and indeed discussions outside of it.</p>
<p>We never learn what was meant to happen at the end of the countdown. And (not connected to that) the character we&rsquo;re first sympathetic to betrays all of humanity!</p>
<p>I liked the early parts about the Cultural Revolution in China. They linked surprisingly well into my <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/10/13/of-all-the.html">recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nineteen Eighty-Four<!-- raw HTML omitted --> deep dive</a>. Which is amusing because not long ago I read something about someone encouraging someone else to read this, where they said you just had to get past that part to really start enjoying it.</p>
<p>I did enjoy it, mind. I went right out and bought the sequels and have started <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Dark Forest<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I just find it weird. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://devilgate.org/2015/10/06/the-threebody-problem.html">actually a reread</a>, but it&rsquo;s nearly a decade since, and I only remembered two scenes.</p>

			 <h2 id="ministry-of-plenty">Ministry of Plenty</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2024. It&rsquo;s 40 years since 1984. So I guess that&rsquo;s why there have been a lot of things turning up that are related in one way or another to George Orwell&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nineteen Eighty-Four<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s considerably more than forty years since the novel was published: more like 75 years. Which is a memorable enough number in itself.</p>
<p>At Worldcon in Glasgow in August, the last panel I went to was about the book. People discussing when they had first read it, how it had affected them, the effects it had on literature and culture more broadly, and so on.</p>
<p>Then a few weeks later the podcast of the BBC Radio 4 programme <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In Our Time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dropped into my feed, with an episode about it. It was described as a &lsquo;summer repeat&rsquo;. I assume the programme is off the air but they like to keep the feed fed.  <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001bz77">It was originally broadcast in 2022</a>, so nothing to do with any anniversaries in this year, but no matter.</p>
<p>All of this served to remind me of two things: one, that it was high time I read it again. And two, since read it in my teenage years and never since, I had shamefully never quite read <em>all</em> of it. Because there&rsquo;s that bit in the middle where Winston is reading &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;, as it&rsquo;s called. And when you&rsquo;re fourteen or fifteen that can seem terribly dull and easily skippable.</p>
<p>Also at the convention<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I picked up a copy of Ken MacLeod&rsquo;s new collection, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Jura for Julia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  You might guess from the title that there&rsquo;s some sort of connection, what with Julia being the only female character in the original book, and Jura being where Orwell spent the last months of his life writing it.</p>
<p>And indeed, the collection is bookended by two connected stories comprising a sequel to Orwell&rsquo;s novel.</p>
<p>So I was going to revisit the original and then read Ken&rsquo;s stories. But I realised I didn&rsquo;t actually have a copy. I think I read it from the library all those years ago. We got our son a copy at some point, but that&rsquo;s either with him or in a box in the basement. So I decided just to buy a new one.</p>
<p>While I was in Foyles I noticed another connected work: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Julia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Sandra Newman. I remembered reading about this when it came out and thinking I&rsquo;d like to read it. It&rsquo;s a retelling of the story of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nineteen Eighty-Four<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, from Julia&rsquo;s point of view. It came out last year, so I&rsquo;m sure author and publisher had anniversaries in mind, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<h2 id="not-forever">Not Forever</h2>
<p>So what about these books, then?</p>
<p>There are two things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_geography_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four">Ingsoc</a> got right, I mention in passing: going over properly to the metric system — which leads to the oddity of a prole barman who has never even heard of a pint — and going to full use of the twenty-four-hour clock, giving us that famously startling opening line about the clocks striking thirteen.</p>
<p>Not much else, though. It&rsquo;s a bit odd thinking about it now that the ideology is called &lsquo;<em>English</em> Socialism&rsquo; when the geopolitical bloc Airstrip One is part of, Oceania, is clearly dominated by America. The renaming of the UK makes that clear. And indeed, the switch to decimal measurements and twenty-four-hour time are even stranger, given how America in our world is the biggest holdout against those.</p>
<p>I suppose the &lsquo;English&rsquo; in &lsquo;Ingsoc&rsquo; could mean the language. But a socialism dominated by America? Something that calls itself socialism, at least: it&rsquo;s no more socialism than Germany&rsquo;s &lsquo;National Socialism&rsquo; was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before that I dislike dystopian fiction as genre or background to stories. I wonder if that dislike was caused in part by early inoculation with this work.  But what I found really weird about reading it after all these years is how weirdly <em>cosy</em> it all felt. Maybe it&rsquo;s just because I knew what happens; maybe because there are these sequels by other hands to consider; or it could be somehow inherent in the writing. But I had no real sense of bleakness, nor even of menace. Strange, really.</p>
<p>It is, of course, a tragedy, among other things. Winston and Julia know that they&rsquo;ll be caught by the Thought Police and taken to the Ministry of Love eventually; but they believe that, whatever they have to go through, there will be a core of them, deep in their hearts, that will survive, uncorrupted, undefeated. I was reminded of Evey, in Alan Moore and David Lloyd&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->V for Vendetta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. About how you&rsquo;ll survive — maybe win — as long as they can never reach that last half inch of you (I write from probably inaccurate memory).</p>
<p>That turns out not to be true for Winston and Julia, as they each betray the other. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s assertion that &lsquo;We will empty you out and fill you up with us&rsquo; proves true; and the novel closes with Winston loving Big Brother. There is no hope. A boot stamping on a human face.</p>
<p>Except, then we get the appendix. It tells the story of Newspeak, and does so wholly in the past tense, describing plans the party had for the minimal, stripped-down language. How it was expected to limit the capability for thoughtcrime — for thought itself — in the populace forced to use it. But it is presented as if it were an academic work, part of a history of the Big Brother times in what was then called Airstrip One, and is now called Britain again.</p>
<p>Hope in an appendix. I like it.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-it-short">Keeping it Short</h2>
<p>So we come to the first sequel I want to speak of, which is composed of Ken MacLeod&rsquo;s two short stories. &lsquo;Nineteen Eighty-Nine&rsquo; picks up on Winston&rsquo;s story. He&rsquo;s taken from the Chestnut Tree café thinking he&rsquo;s finally going to be killed. But in fact it&rsquo;s the revolution. Big Brother and the party are overthrown. Winston is to be Minister of Truth in the new government.</p>
<p>And then in &lsquo;A Jura for Julia&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a decade or two later. Julia is a researcher in &lsquo;computational literature&rsquo;, mechanical writing. She used to be a mechanic who worked on the machines that created cheap novels for the proles. Now she&rsquo;s an academic studying the technology behind the machines. She travels to Jura because she has heard there is an important link there to the history of the machines. What she finds ties her story and Winston&rsquo;s together with Orwell&rsquo;s in a fascinating way.</p>
<h2 id="a-womans-perspective">A Woman&rsquo;s Perspective</h2>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Sandra Newman before <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Julia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but she&rsquo;s written several books, and been nominated for various awards. This one is authorised by Orwell&rsquo;s estate and tells the familiar story from Julia&rsquo;s perspective, expanding it both in worldbuilding, character, and time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a much richer story than Orwell&rsquo;s, in that Julia&rsquo;s character is dramatically expanded from the original, and we learn a great deal about the society, or the various societies that exist in Airstrip One. It&rsquo;s all well done, very convincing, and completely in keeping with the original. There&rsquo;s nothing added that couldn&rsquo;t have been imagined in Orwell&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Julia the character is not much more than a cipher in the original, and here she has a rich inner life, and is wonderfully and believably changeable.</p>
<p>One chapter opens with the line, &lsquo;She was in Love.&rsquo; Which jars you for a second, because the previous chapter ended with her and Winston&rsquo;s arrest. Till you remember that she refers to the ministries just by their key words: &lsquo;Truth&rsquo; for the Ministry of Truth, and so on.</p>
<p>It takes us to a an ending not so very different from MacLeod&rsquo;s but perhaps a more ambiguous one.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s enough <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nineteen Eighty-Four<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for a while, and enough 1984, too, though it strikes me that the novel I&rsquo;m writing at the moment is set then. It&rsquo;s a year that still has a massive gravitational pull on the imagination.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781915556431">Nova Scotia Vol 2</a>: New Speculative Fiction from Scotland, Edited by Neil Williamson and Andrew J Wilson 📚</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a record for the longest gap between volumes of a series of collections, I think we all know that there&rsquo;s only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dangerous_Visions">one real contender</a>. Though to win it, JMS&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Last Dangerous Visions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will have to actually be released (which, at the time of writing, is scheduled to happen next month, amazingly).</p>
<p>Second on the list, though, might be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nova Scotia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The <a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/novascotiarev.htm">first volume</a> was published in 2005, to more-or-less coincide with the second Glasgow Worldcon. Nineteen years later all is well, as Volume 2 is published to more-or-less coincide with this year&rsquo;s Glasgow Worldcon.</p>
<p>And it is again, very good, and very varied. I&rsquo;m not going to go through the stories, but it struck me that three of them concern someone being resurrected — woken from cryogenic stasis, or reconstructed from DNA and memories — in a future that might not be quite what they had expected or hoped for. A couple of others include bringing back extinct species, or sentient life coming to entities that are not (to the best of our knowledge) sentient at present.</p>
<p>I doubt the stories were chosen deliberately to have those connections. Rather, perhaps this is how our current end-of-the-world fears are playing out: in fantasies of technological afterlives. Not that such stories are particularly new, but maybe they&rsquo;re particularly <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>Notable contributors: Ken McLeod, of course, Scotland&rsquo;s premier living SF author. James Kelman, surprisingly: as one of Scotland&rsquo;s best-known <em>literary</em> authors, it&rsquo;s pleasing that he&rsquo;d lower himself into our genre murk. Grant Morrison, Scotland&rsquo;s best known comics writer, I imagine. And plenty others.</p>

<p>I saw Tendai (as is his name) interviewed at Worldcon last month. Went along without knowing anything about him or his writing, and the interview was interesting enough that I went and bought this in the dealers' room immediately afterwards. Or maybe the next day, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edinburgh Nights<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series, which I think is currently at three books with a fourth on the way and a fifth planned. Which means it kind of violates one of my personal guidelines to have bought it, but what the hell, you know?</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s set in an alternative Edinburgh where there&rsquo;s magic. The time is approximately the present day, because there&rsquo;s things like smartphones. But our heroine, Ropa, can talk to ghosts, which tend to hang about when they&rsquo;ve got unfinished business back on the plane of the living.</p>
<p>And a whole lot more happens besides. It&rsquo;s a pretty bleak environment that she lives in, essentially a shanty town of caravans on the edge of the city, very much hand to mouth. It feels kind of post-apocalypse, but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s been anything quite as disastrous as that, just a slow decline. Not sure, though, there are hints at things. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see where he takes it.</p>
<p>As far as the &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t start a series that the author hasn&rsquo;t finished writing&rsquo; guideline goes, it&rsquo;s pretty standalone, thought with plenty of setup for more.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780385671316">Case Histories</a> by Kate Atkinson 📚</p>
<p>I mentioned in the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/09/03/finished-reading-death.html">last books post</a> that I&rsquo;ve seen the Jackson Brodie TV series. Well, maybe not all of them. I enjoyed the latest book in the series so much that I thought I&rsquo;d go back and read the earlier ones. This is the first, and the story was completely unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>It was also surprisingly horrific. It starts by setting up three &lsquo;case histories&rsquo;, with three stories of crimes at different times in the past: a young girl disappears; a young woman is murdered; another young woman murders her husband.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re introduced to Jackson Brodie: divorced and trying to co-parent a young daughter and carry on his life, while also trying to run a private detective agency in Cambridge, a city he hates.</p>
<p>Somehow, all these cases are going to come together and get solved. As I said about the latest book, though, it&rsquo;s clear that Atkinson&rsquo;s writing about the minutiae of the human heart, far more than the minutiae of detective work. And that&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an enjoyable, easy read — well, apart from the gruesomeness and tension of the first three chapters — and intriguingly it ends as if Brodie&rsquo;s career is over. I don&rsquo;t know if she planned to write sequels, but clearly something must change.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780385548007">Death at the Sign of the Rook</a> by Kate Atkinson 📚</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read several of Kate Atkinson&rsquo;s books, but never one of her Jackson Brodie detective series. This despite having seen the TV adaptations. So getting this as a birthday present was great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re promised a murder mystery set against the background of a country house hosting a murder-mystery party, and that&rsquo;s what we get, eventually. I really enjoyed it, but if anything I&rsquo;d like her to spend more time with the titular detective.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But we get various viewpoint characters, and really very little from Brodie&rsquo;s viewpoint. Very little actual detecting, too.</p>
<p>Indeed, I got the impression that Atkinson doesn&rsquo;t really <em>want</em> to be writing a detective story. Or she does, of course, but she&rsquo;s so keen on multiple viewpoints and character creation — and so good at them — that those are the things she&rsquo;s doing, more than writing a conventional story of a detective solving a mystery.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with that, of course, you can tell any story you want, any way you want, and why be bound by conventions?</p>

I assume that the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/08/16/finished-reading-against.html">third</a> volume just became so long that the publishers, and probably Donaldson himself, decided it needed to be split in two. Each of the third and fourth volumes is about the same length, anyway.</p>
<p>And they bring everything to a satisfying conclusion, that&rsquo;s the main thing. Of course Linden hesitates, and Covenant resists using wild magic (but not to the extent he once did). Of course Donaldson uses fifty words where fifteen would do. Of course his writerly tics come through.</p>
<p>But the pages keep turning, and old friends and enemies turn up, and Wild Magic, Law, and Earthpower do their things, and we all leave satisfied.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780356206523">The Crow Road</a> by Iain Banks 📚</p>
<p>You will, I think, be far from surprised to learn that this is a reread. At least the third read, in fact. I suggested it as a possibility for my book club, and when it wasn&rsquo;t chosen I decided it was time anyway.</p>
<p>There are still books that should be in <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a> that I&rsquo;ve only read once: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stonemouth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Quarry<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But I&rsquo;ll get to those eventually.</p>
<p>One oddity about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Crow Road<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is that I&rsquo;ve never blogged about it before. Yet I&rsquo;ve loved it since I first read the opening line, at a convention in Glasgow in 1992, if memory serves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just read the opening line and you&rsquo;ll buy it,&rsquo; my friend Steve said, when I was hesitant about shelling out the huge £10 price for the hardback. I had already read all of Banks&rsquo;s earlier books, so I was definitely planning on getting it, but waiting for the paperback was the norm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was the day my grandmother exploded.&rsquo; Steve was right. I bought it, and all he subsequent books, in hardback.</p>
<p>Memory does serve, but not all that well: <a href="https://devilgate.org/2013/06/17/forgot-the-cry.html">I&rsquo;ve written all that before</a>, it turns out, after Banksie died. Though it remains slightly unclear which convention it was that year.</p>
<p>A book is more than its opening line, though. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Crow Road<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a family drama, set mostly in a fictional Scottish town not far from where I grew up. Also in Glasgow, a non-fictional city where the titular road exists. The metaphorical one is everywhere, of course: it means death, in the vernacular of that exploding grandmother.</p>
<p>I read it with more of a writerly eye this time, I think, and I wondered whether the structural games really add anything to the whole. I don&rsquo;t mean the parts that are effectively speculative: the main character, Prentice McHoan, trying to work out what might have happened to his missing uncle. Nor the flashbacks in third-person, when the main narrative is in first. That makes sense, as they&rsquo;re showing us Prentice&rsquo;s childhood, or things that happened to other family members when Prentice wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more thinking about a couple of flashes forward, that hint about where the many narrative is going to go. They aren&rsquo;t enough to really make the reader speculate, and they happen when we&rsquo;re already well into the story, so they aren&rsquo;t needed to make us keep going.</p>
<p>They  do no harm, though, and maybe Banksie needed to use them to keep his own interest up. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with them, or that.</p>
<p>I do find it hard to explain why this book is so compelling. I think it&rsquo;s probably his best non-SF book. It&rsquo;s probably not quite my favourite, though it&rsquo;s up there. I&rsquo;ve long thought it was partly cultural for me, in that the characters and locations feel like people and places I knew growing up. But that can&rsquo;t explain its broader appeal.</p>
<p>I guess Banksie was just a great writer.</p>

			 <p>I seem to have largely stopped blogging. Certainly, as a general election approaches, I&rsquo;ve written nothing publicly about politics.</p>
<p>Consider: in just over a week we could be rid of this appalling Tory government. The Labour one we get in its place (or, just possibly, a coalition) will probably not be much to write home about, but even if its policies are far from perfect, its plans to tax the rich and invest in the country&rsquo;s infrastructure far weaker than I&rsquo;d like: things can hardly be worse.</p>
<p>Indeed, they can only get better, right?</p>
<p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/01/18/i-joined-the.html">saw Keir Starmer speak at the Fabian Society</a> a few years back. 2020, surprisingly, but January, before the pandemic really got going. He came across there as a thoroughly good and decent, left-wing, progressive guy. I can&rsquo;t remember anything he said specifically, but it was positive, you know?</p>
<p>Now, he&rsquo;s generally seen as timid, scared of appearing to be too left-wing, that sort of thing, or worse. While at the same time seemingly fierce at purging the left of the party. And poor on women&rsquo;s rights, to say nothing of his dealings with women MPs and candidates.</p>
<p>Still, after the shitshow of the last few years, I&rsquo;ll accept competence, as long as it&rsquo;s not right-wing competence.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780356517179">Some Desperate Glory</a> by Emily Tesh 📚</p>
<p>Actually finished this a few weeks ago, and forgot to write about it. I don&rsquo;t know why, because it&rsquo;s <em>absolutely fantastic</em>. Space opera of the biggest scope, yet a tightly-focused character-driven story, and a <em>bildungsroman</em>.</p>
<p>The Earth has already been destroyed when we start reading. Our heroine, Valkyr, or Kyr for short, lives on humanity&rsquo;s last outpost (or is it?), where they train for revenge.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so much more to it than that.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529077094">My Brother</a> by Jamaica Kincaid 📚</p>
<p>The latest bookclub book. Kincaid&rsquo;s brother died in 1996 of AIDS. Kincaid herself was estranged from her family for 20 years, so she saw her brother when he was three, and then again when he was 33, and dying.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly this is more about her than about him. She looks at feelings towards her birth family: does she love her brother? Does she love her mother? &lsquo;No&rsquo; is her conclusion for both. But she examines different kinds of love, different ways of loving.</p>
<p>Parts of it are kind of like cubist art in a way: examining the same place, person, or event, at different times, in the way the cubists would try to show a subject from different angles at the same time.</p>
<p>The writing flows very smoothly despite some impressively- if not excessively-long sentences.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781786897077">A River Called Time</a> by Courttia Newland 📚</p>
<p>I got this as a Christmas present from my beloved. I had no idea who Courttia Newland is. I assumed it was a woman, at first. It&rsquo;s not, and it turns out I had experienced some of his work already, as he wrote some of the scripts for Steve McQueen&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Small Axe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  series of films; specifically <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/01/26/lovers-rock.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lover&rsquo;s Rock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,</a>  <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/02/07/red-white-and.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Red, White and Blue<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> , and <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/03/06/education.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Education<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> . (I wouldn&rsquo;t bother clicking those links, it looks like I didn&rsquo;t write anything about them.)</p>
<p>I started the novel without reading any reviews or anything about it other than the blurb and quotes on the cover. The key one of those is this, from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Observer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A vast and wildly ambitious piece of speculative fiction that asks what the world would look like if slavery and colonialism never existed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which set me up with some expectations. Sensibly, Newland doesn&rsquo;t make this imagined world a utopia. Far from it, in fact. The world in which the protagonist, Markriss, finds himself, is pretty grim.</p>
<p>And to my mind, at least at first, the only thing in-universe that tells us about the absence of colonialism, etc, is skin colour is never mentioned. Yes, the world is different from our own, and it turns out (reading around the novel) a major reason is, instead of the weird monotheism of Judaeo-Christianity-Islam having the major religious impact on world history, African religions have the biggest influence.</p>
<p>What this means for our hero is he can have an out-of-body experience and it not exactly be unexpected.</p>
<p>Which takes us into the whole out-of-this-world part of this novel. All those blurbs talk about it as a novel of decolonisation and so on, which is fine. But that&rsquo;s because Newland has a mainstream, literary reputation — he has published several previous novels. <em>This</em>, though is a genre work. Science fiction, you might say, or fantasy, looked at from another direction.</p>
<p>And what nothing prepares you for (well, the reviews do, but I didn&rsquo;t want to read them first) is that this is a multiverse story. Because Markriss&rsquo;s ability to leave his body in his astral form develops to the point where he can do so permanently; and then drop back down into a different tributary of the titular river.</p>
<p>This puts him in an alternative version of himself: another timeline. Some have very similar events and experiences; some are very different, such as one that doesn&rsquo;t look at all removed from our own. He always has some of the people closest to him, though their relationships vary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s effective and accomplished, but it can be unsatisfying. Because, when he leaves a timeline, he leaves its story incomplete. We don&rsquo;t know what happened to the first version of Markriss, or the second, or…</p>
<p>Sometimes the language, the linguistic style, can be confusing. But it feels like a positive sort of confusion, the kind that stretches your mind.</p>
<p>On the whole, I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>This is a monster, behemoth of a book. At over 800 pages it&rsquo;s not the longest I&rsquo;ve read in recent years, but it&rsquo;s up there. And it is… very strange.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read several of Keenan&rsquo;s books before, and enjoyed them, but found them strange. This one is composed of three or four different narratives. They&rsquo;re interlinked, or at least interconnected, but they&rsquo;re very different.</p>
<p>A love story in France of a few years ago about someone who is studying cathedrals (sort of); a historical story about the Siege of Khartoum; a far-future science-fiction story supposedly written by two of the characters in one of the other sections.</p>
<p>And so on. It will bear rereading, I imagine, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll dedicate the time. I started it just before Christmas and finished it this morning. With a few other books in between, but still.</p>

			 <p>I didn&rsquo;t know I was writing a trilogy, but here we are.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/02/24/well-this-is.html">finding the mysterious pasta shape last weekend</a>, having <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/01/04/a-pasta-mystery.html">learned about it in early 2021</a> from <a href="https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/12/2020-bucatini-shortage-investigation.html">an article by Rachel Handler</a> in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Magazine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we finally tried it last night.</p>
<p>Rachel believes bucatini is &lsquo;the only noodle worth eating; all other dry pastas might as well be firewood.&rsquo; And she describes it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>spaghetti but thicker and with a hole in it, meaning it absorbs 200 percent more sauce than its thinner, hole-free brethren, due to math.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rereading the article now, I had forgotten that she did a whole investigation about the shortage, writing it as if it were about a grave conspiracy, and hoping she might be called &lsquo;the Bernstein of Bucatini&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So what of it?</p>
<p>It was… fine, I guess? Like spaghetti, but thicker.</p>
<p>But I fear we might not be getting the real thing. From the photograph accompanying the article, the hole through the noodles looks quite substantial. Whereas in the packet we have — the brand being Tesco Finest — the hole is quite narrow. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York<!-- raw HTML omitted --> photo might be exaggerating the holiness, but I suspect we&rsquo;re being fobbed off over here, with fakeatini.</p>
<p>Certainly there&rsquo;s no way it collected three times the sauce that standard spaghetti does.</p>
<p>Of course, if you go back to my picture from the other day you&rsquo;ll see that the packet describes it as &lsquo;<strong>Spaghetti</strong>&rsquo; in big letters, with &lsquo;bucatini&rsquo; underneath, in much smaller type, like a subtitle.</p>
<p>Maybe, rather than a fake, we have a hybrid.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781787612747">The House at the End of the Sea</a> by Victoria M. Adams 📚</p>
<p>First, a disclaimer: the author of this book was on the same Creative Writing MA as me, and I read a prerelease PDF that she sent me.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s a really good young-adult fantasy story set in the real world, present day.</p>
<p>Or I think &lsquo;middle grade&rsquo; is the sort of level it&rsquo;s marketed towards. The main character, Saffi, is about 12. Her younger brother is maybe eight or ten. Their mum has died tragically young and their dad takes them from London to live with their grandparents in a B&amp;B by the sea in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>The titular house has been in the family for generations, and it has A History. The kids hate it at first, but Saffi tries to adjust and to keep her brother&rsquo;s spirits up. She is helped by a slightly mysterious local boy they meet.</p>
<p>And then a group of guests arrive at the B&amp;B. In the middle of the night. Without coming through the door.</p>
<p>Things get stranger after that. Will Saffi and Milo save the family&rsquo;s legacy, themselves, and their new friend&rsquo;s home, from the plans of these powerful figures out of myth and fairytale? Only by reading will you find out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great. Get it for your kids.</p>

But Letterboxd knows it as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Boyfriends and Girlfriends<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

<p>I remember seeing this complaint years ago. &lsquo;Why do we refer to people with a term that comes from the illegal drugs trade?&rsquo; was a common refrain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, people taking illegal drugs <em>are</em> sometimes referred to as &lsquo;users&rsquo;. But only really in 70s cop shows. I grew up on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Starsky &amp; Hutch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kojak<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as much as the next guy my age, but I don&rsquo;t look to them for appropriate linguistic terms today.</p>
<p>More to the point, the term &lsquo;user&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t <em>come</em> from the drug trade, it <em>went to</em> it. The term just comes from the English language: from the verb &lsquo;to use&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Anyone who uses any item is a &lsquo;user&rsquo; of that item. If I cut a slice of bread, I&rsquo;m a user of the bread knife. If I go into the garden to gather the still-uncollected autumn leaves, I&rsquo;m a user of the rake. And so on.</p>
<p>Ian prefers the term &lsquo;customer&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s fair enough if you bought the item in question. But he also writes about using <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, which is a piece of software that is available at no cost. I use it every day, but I&rsquo;m not a customer of the people who make it. Ian may pay them, as it&rsquo;s possible to do for certain features, or just to support them. But there are plenty of examples of software for which that is not the case. It&rsquo;s just free. You&rsquo;re not a customer of Linus Torvalds when you use Linux, for example.</p>
<p>Anyway, my feelings are almost the opposite: being a <em>user</em> — or a <em>reader</em> or a <em>listener</em> or <em>viewer</em>, for that matter — is the truth, is the state that has power, has meaning. Not the tawdry commercial act, the mere fact of when or whether we bought a thing.</p>

<p>If Apple needed a general-purpose language for configuration, why did they invent their own, rather than using Terraform, say?</p>
<p>But then, this Pkl (‘Pickle’) seems a lot more expressive than Terraform, and a lot more down-to-Earth and less cloudy.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781324064831">The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida</a> by Shehan Karunatilaka 📚</p>
<p>I can see why this won the Booker <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last year<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the year before last. It&rsquo;s beautifully written, with a kind of light, easy style. And yet it goes to some very, very dark places.</p>
<p>The titular Maali is dead at the start, finds himself in the afterlife, and doesn&rsquo;t know how he died. He&rsquo;s given seven days — the &lsquo;moons&rsquo; of the title — to find out, or not, before he has to decide whether or not to go into &lsquo;The Light&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There are ghosts, ghouls, demons, and horrors. Most of the latter two are living humans, because we&rsquo;re in Sri Lanka&rsquo;s civil war, and Maali was a photographer who photographed the horrors. Many of the dead he meets died in atrocities, and they&rsquo;re not shy about sharing their stories.</p>
<p>I can highly recommend this, but not if you&rsquo;ll be too disturbed by stories of atrocities. So think of this as a content warning.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in 2021, when I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/03/30/how-to-write.html">read Chee&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How to Write an Autobiographical Novel<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>, I expressed an interest in this book, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edinburgh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, largely because of its title. As I said then, &lsquo;the Edinburgh connection in the novel didn’t survive the writing and editing process, but he kept the title anyway.&rsquo; There is, in fact, a tangential character in this who has a loose connection to the city, but it&rsquo;s not relevant.</p>
<p>What we have is a <em>bildungsroman</em>, the story of a boy becoming a man, knowing he&rsquo;s gay from an early age, and going through various experiences both because of that fact and having nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>But about halfway through, the first-person narrative switches to a different character&rsquo;s first-person narrative, which caused me some confusion. The sections are headed with the name of the narrator, but since there is only this one change, then a change back for the last quarter, it wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious what was going on.</p>
<p>That was OK though. What I didn&rsquo;t enjoy so much was a kind of allusiveness that really became vagueness, which at times made it slightly hard to see what he was getting at. Especially in the last quarter.</p>
<p>And that last quarter is the most difficult and problematic part of the whole. See, early on, the first narrator is abused, along with several classmates, by a teacher. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much effect on the narrator, though it does on some of the other victims.</p>
<p>But in the end the main narrator becomes an abuser himself; of the other narrator, who is linked to the whole story in a way that is, frankly, too coincidental. And it all ends in a kind of unresolved ambiguity which I found left a bad taste.</p>
<p>All in all, I preferred his nonfiction.</p>

			 <p>The first Christmas-present book, finished on boxing day.  Short, and a page-turner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read an Agatha Christie before, perhaps surprisingly. I&rsquo;m not even sure I&rsquo;ve seen any significant adaptation, except I once caught the end of one. Of this novel, unfortunately. So I sort of knew what the conclusion was, which meant I was seeing how the clues pointed in that direction.</p>
<p>No matter, it&rsquo;s still a great read, and makes me want to read more.</p>

			 <p>I suppose I should tell you what I thought of the three <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 60th anniversary specials.</p>
<p>They were good. Not great, but good. My favourite of the three — and I think probably the best, too — was the middle one, &lsquo;Wild Blue Yonder&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As to the ending, the &lsquo;bi-generation&rsquo; thing was daft, but fun. It was good to give the leaving and arriving Doctors the chance to interact, and a Doctor ending without it being a death was good.</p>
<p>However, let us speak of the extension of that effect, as explained in <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/doctor-who-bigeneration-doctorverse-newsupdate/">this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Radio Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article</a>. I was directed there by <a href="https://micro.blog/BenSouthwood">@BenSouthwood</a>, via a <a href="https://bensouthwood.me/2023/12/09/doctor-who-was.html">conversation on Micro.blog</a>.</p>
<p>As I said there, I loved the idea of the Timeless Child, and the expansion it brought to The Doctor&rsquo;s past and the prehistory of the Time Lords. But this &lsquo;every Doctor is now bi-generated&rsquo; idea just seems like it leaves things in a mess.</p>
<p>Sure, you can explain it all away with branching timelines, alternative realities and all that. But it all just seems a bit too chaotic, you know? Even if they never use it, it feels unnecessary.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this idea of making an expanded &lsquo;Whoniverse&rsquo;, in the vein of what Marvel and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have become. Disney&rsquo;s money is going to allow this, presumably. More shows, even, than when we had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Torchwood<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sarah Jane Adventures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Trouble is, from my point of view, that I&rsquo;ve lost interest in both <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Marvel exactly because there&rsquo;s <em>so much stuff</em>. It&rsquo;s all just too much.</p>
<p>So I hope my favourite programme doesn&rsquo;t go the same way. Or at least, if it does, that the original programme will always remain at the hearts of the franchise, and not depend on any of the expansion packs.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had this book for years, and I thought I had read it. Took a look at it a week or two back and realised I hadn&rsquo;t. So I did.</p>
<p>What I also didn&rsquo;t realise was that it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://christopher-priest.co.uk/books/the-dream-archipelago">Dream Archipelago</a> story. Which is surprising, since it starts in present-day (1980s) London. In fact it&rsquo;s the <a href="https://christopher-priest.co.uk/books/the-affirmation">first novel</a> (though not, I think, the first story) to use the Dream Archipelago as a setting, or state of mind.</p>
<p>Peter Sinclair suffers various crises in his personal life, and decides to write an autobiography to better understand himself. Through various revisions his writing becomes more fictionalised, until he&rsquo;s writing about the islands. Or living in them. Is it alternative world or madness? Portal fantasy or mental breakdown?</p>
<p>Or maybe both, or neither. You could argue that as a story it doesn&rsquo;t entirely make sense, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d go there. I mean, I&rsquo;d go <em>there</em>, to the Archipelago, for sure (it feels a lot like Greece to me, and indeed Sinclair and his ex/not-ex girlfriend met there, we are told).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a novel that leaves you questioning its realities, and maybe your own. And that seems like a good thing to me.</p>

			 <p>In a way it was surprising that Shane MacGowan survived this long, considering his noted and dramatic habits. But it&rsquo;s still sad that he&rsquo;s died.</p>
<p>I count The Pogues as one of the bands I&rsquo;ve seen live most of all. The only other one that comes close would be The Fall, and either could be the winner. Goes back to 1985, either way.</p>
<p>The Pogues were vey much a band of supremely talented musicians and songwriters. But Shane was the driving force. What they did was to meld punk with Irish folk music. The former, of course had helped me through my adolescent years and would remain a lifelong love. The latter: well, I came from a Scottish Catholic background, so it was pretty familiar, between Scottish folk and Irish songs sung at Celtic matches.</p>
<p>So on the instant that I first heard them — certainly on Peel, and probably &lsquo;Sally MacLennane&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d say — they clicked. There was no learning curve, no adjustment to this new sound. It was just <em>there</em>, it belonged, as if it had always existed.</p>
<p>The Pogues may have been inevitable, but Shane was a genius. And his songs, as I <a href="https://devilgate.micro.blog/2014/03/13/some-people-left.html">wrote when Phil Chevron died</a> were steeped in death imagery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with a couple of excellent screen grabs from Twitter (where, just to note, as I write, &lsquo;Sodomy and the Lash&rsquo; is trending under a &lsquo;food&rsquo; heading, which is just beyond weird.</p>
<p>First, this excellent mashups of the day&rsquo;s deaths of noted figures:</p>

			 <p>Why did nobody ever tell me that this book is funny? I had it in my head as a slightly worthy, if much-loved, courtroom drama. But the trial is only part of it, and quite small part at that. Though its ramifications play out to the end, and echo back to near the start.</p>
<p>Scout is an endearing narrator, wise beyond her years, tough, smart. Lee conjures a believable, well-formed picture of life in small-town Alabama in the thirties. A place of community and friendship, gossip and criticism, poverty and hard work. And a few people, notably Atticus, of course, willing to do the right thing in the face of dangerous racist neighbours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s intriguing, from a writer&rsquo;s perspective, how the narrative voice changes in the courtroom scenes when they do come.</p>
<p>And Boo Radley gave the band their name. I don&rsquo;t think I knew that, or if I did I&rsquo;d forgotten.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need me to tell you it&rsquo;s a classic, and it turns out, for good reason.</p>

			 <p>There is no evidence in the text of this book that it is SF. Yet here I have a copy, published in the SF Masterworks series.</p>
<p>Graham Sleight addresses this in his introduction, but doesn&rsquo;t try to give a conclusive reading either. There is no definitive answer, as the work is deliberately ambiguous.</p>
<p>The titular Sarah is a woman described as ‘ugly’ who turns up in the camp of some Chinese men who are working on railroads in the USA of the 1870s. She speaks no known human language, though she does make sounds. She gains her name later because, a character says, ‘she sings like an angel’. One of the men, a young man called Chin, is volunteered to try to find where she belongs, or failing that, at least get rid of her, so she stops distracting them.</p>
<p>So begins a trek across the Pacific Northwest and beyond. Along the ways we meet various characters with various good and bad qualities.</p>
<p>The ending is, as I say, ambiguous. We never find out who or what Sarah Canary is. But the journey is quite enjoyable.</p>

			 <p>I picked this up because of the title, taken as it obviously is from an early song by <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/the-clash/">my favourite band</a>. I bought it because it is set in and around the famous anti-Nazi festival in Victoria Park in London. Or at least it starts there.</p>
<p>Though that&rsquo;s not quite true. It starts even closer to home for me: my kids' primary school is mentioned early on, and many other streets, pubs, takeaways and landmarks that still exist are visited.</p>
<p>Joe Thomas was born in 1977, so he&rsquo;s doing this from research, not memory, but it captures the area very well, and the time — well, from what I know of those times in London, I think he&rsquo;s done a great job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not mainly about the music scene, though. Thomas is a crime writer, and this is, kind of, a crime novel. And becomes more so as it goes on, and jumps to 1983. As you might imagine, given the notoriety of Stoke Newington Police Station of the time, it&rsquo;s about bent coppers. And one more-or-less decent cop who is — we think — trying to bring them down.</p>
<p>I say &lsquo;We think&rsquo;, because it&rsquo;s not finished. It turns out it&rsquo;s the start of a trilogy, with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Red Menace<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->True Blue<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to follow. This one was only published this year, so I guess it&rsquo;ll be a while before we see the followups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all pretty good. It uses a slightly odd, cut-up sort of style: half sentences, fragments ending in dashes. But it&rsquo;s very readable. As I say, I was drawn to it by the music and the locations, but I enjoyed spending time with the characters, and the situation is compelling. Real life events are stitched into fictional ones (or vice-versa).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, then, it&rsquo;s a very political book. And surprisingly Thatcher turns up as a character. I&rsquo;m not sure why Thomas choose to do that. Maybe since most of the characters are on the left, it was to provide some sort of balance. Why not go as far up and right as possible, I suppose. I don&rsquo;t mean Thatcher is the furthest-right person in it, to be fair: the National Front are heavily involved, too.</p>
<p>The main police character is running &lsquo;spycops&rsquo;, and has operatives inside both the NF and the loose coalition of groups that oppose them (the Anti-Nazi League, Rock Against Racism, the Socialist Workers' Party). I expect as the series goes on we&rsquo;ll see some version of the scandals around that whole business, too.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s slightly surprising, perhaps, that I&rsquo;ve never seen this horror
classic, given my sometime, occasional, interest in the genre. But then,
it wasn&rsquo;t available or was hard to get in the UK for the core years
when I might have seen it.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s on iPlayer just now, so I rectified the situation.</p>
<p>Except I almost didn&rsquo;t get past the first ten minutes. Honestly, I was
so bored with the slow, tedious Iraq-set grave-robbing scene  <em>that has
nothing to do with the rest of the story!</em></p>
<p>And the film as a whole is weirdly fragmentary, disjointed after that,
at least for the first half.</p>
<p>Then the last third is just one big advert for the Catholic church.
Though I would note that the exorcism fails, the old exorcist is killed
offscreen (and weirdly, he turns out to be the archaeologist/grave
robber from the start).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the self-sacrifice of the doubting Jesuit Father Karras, that gets
the demon out of the girl. His ending is one of the bravest things I&rsquo;ve
ever seen in a film. And those steps were the scariest thing in this
film.</p>
<p>Presumably the necklace/coin-like artefact that somehow made its way
from Iraq was supposed to have had something to do with allowing the
demon into the girl, but no use or sense of that was made in the story.</p>
<p>Decent effects. good makeup, and a great performance from Linda Blair
(if slightly wooden performances from most of the rest of the cast)
leave this as just OK, and far from the classic of its repute.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, of course.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not Nolan&rsquo;s best, and I&rsquo;m not sure it entirely makes sense. But it was better, and easier to understand, than I&rsquo;d been led to believe. Of course, I was watching it at home, with subtitles on, so that always helps with making out mumblecore actors.</p>
<p>But the time-flipping: I realise it&rsquo;s well thought-out, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s quite well thought out <em>enough</em>.

<p>This one is a historical novel based on the true story of the Mirabal sisters, three women from the Dominican Republic who were assassinated for political activism by the regime of the dictator Trujillo, in 1960. Among the history of Latin American dictatorships, that was one I had never heard of.</p>
<p>A fictionalised story, bringing the characters to the fore. There&rsquo;s relatively little about what they actually did regarding revolutionary activities, but lots about them as daughters, as mothers. It&rsquo;s told from four points of view: each of the murdered sisters, Patria, Minerva, and Mate; and that of their surviving sister, Dedé.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautifully written novel, heartbreaking because you know how it&rsquo;s going to end, and because the characters are so well-realised, so brought to life.</p>
<p>The day they were murdered, the 25th of November 1960, is memorialised by the UN as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_for_the_Elimination_of_Violence_against_Women">International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women</a>.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s only a few days since I finished — just over a week since the year-long wait was over — and it seems like ages. Now we&rsquo;re back into another wait — hopefully not more than a year — till we find out what&rsquo;s next for Strike and Robin.</p>

<p>Minor spoilers follow.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t enjoy this as much as the previous one or two, I think. Certainly at first I was a bit disappointed because of the time-jump.

<p>But I think the main problem was that the two main characters are separated for much of it, precisely because she&rsquo;s undercover, so can&rsquo;t really communicate with him.</p>
<p>Of course, once it all kicked into gear, the pages kept turning like they always do. But, while it was great to see them bring down an appalling cult, it just wasn&rsquo;t as emotionally resonant for me as, especially, the previous two.</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;ve heard comments about this over the years, but I can&rsquo;t
remember whether people say it's surprisingly good, or so bad it's
good.</p>
<p>It's somewhere in between, of course. It's very much of its time,
which was 1995 — the same year as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Matrix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, if I&rsquo;m remembering
correctly. And while it comes from a place not that far from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The
Matrix<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — it&rsquo;s about hackers and how our lives are tied up with
computer systems, after all — it&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>Not least because it&rsquo;s far more a realist piece, compared to the
SF/fantasy stylings of the Wachowskis' film. Here, Sandra Bullock is a
freelance computer expert of loosely defined skills, who gets caught in
the backwash from the corruption of a sometime client&rsquo;s security
software.</p>
<p>Something like that, anyway. It starts very slowly, despite a dramatic
prelude incident, but she&rsquo;s soon on the run, wooed and threatened by a
glamorous hacker/gangster.</p>
<p>Out on her own with no one she can trust, she has to trust herself.</p>
<p>It's not bad. Probably not so-bad-it&rsquo;s-good, either. Just OK.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve always considered this the least of Iain Banks&rsquo;s novels. As, I think, did he. If I remember correctly, this was the one about which he said he wrote it without a plan, and he&rsquo;d never do that again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s strange, coming back to <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a>, and reading this for the first time in many years, to find that I liked it far more than I expected to. (Funny to note that my only other reference to it here was <a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/01/25/a-song-of.html">saying it was better than I remembered</a>.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that bad at all. It doesn&rsquo;t meander the way you might expect the &lsquo;no plan&rsquo; thing to imply. What is striking is how apt the title is. A significant proportion of the narrative is taken up with the main character&rsquo;s dreams. All of which either illuminate her past or tie in to other events in the plot, so they make sense.</p>
<p>But whichever novelist it was that I remember saying, &lsquo;Never have a dream sequence&rsquo; — Chris Priest, I think — must hate it.</p>

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/09/19/a-star-is.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-09-19 20:07:01 &#43;0000">Sep 19, 2023</time></a>

			 <p><img src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/8/6/1/49861-a-star-is-born-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=248b2be6d5" alt=""></p>
<p>The 1954 version of <em>A Star is Born</em> has in it the bones of a great film. It is not, however, the great film it&rsquo;s reputed to be.</p>
<p>I should start by noting that our enjoyment of this was marred by the fact that the sound was out of sync. We rented it from Apple TV on our Roku box, and it was out from the start. I tried all the suggestions I could find online to fix it, short of a factory reset. Thing is, all of those were about the sound being out of sync <em>on the Roku</em>.</p>
<p>But the Roku was fine, in every other app, and in other things in the Apple TV app (great to have <em>The Morning Show</em> back). No, the problem here was that particular file, it seemed like.</p>
<p>Maybe there was a way we could have forced a redownload of it, and got a different version. If so, it wasn&rsquo;t to be found.</p>
<p>But you adjust, you put up with things. We were startled half an hour or so in (to a <em>three hour film</em>, I note) when the video stopped and was replaced with a sepia-toned still image. Clearly a production still. The audio, and the story, carried on. The picture changed to another still. Visuals came back, to a long shot. Then another still.</p>
<p>This was strange enough that it deserved duckducking. Turns out we were seeing the result of studio meddling. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/oqnc5i/a_star_is_born_1954_does_an_uncut_print_exist/">It seems a producer, believing it was too long, made the decision to cut it</a>.
Without the director.</p>
<p>And later the studio, in a BBC-<em>Doctor Who</em>-video-wiping level of stupidity, melted the offcuts down to reclaim the silver.</p>
<p>Thing is, the producer may have been wrong at the time &mdash; according to that story, the shortened version was less popular &mdash; and he was certainly wrong in <em>what</em> he cut; but he wasn&rsquo;t wrong about the film being overlong.</p>
<p>That may be unfair. <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/01/01/rrr.html">Three-hour films can work perfectly well</a>, after
all. No, the edits should have been made at the script stage.</p>
<p>Or maybe at directing.Because this film is incoherent at times. A sudden cut and it&rsquo;s months or years later with no sense of what went on in between. That can be fine, it can work well. Except here it felt
like they had a series of scenes that they wanted to show, and they just bashed them together without a thought for how the story would flow.</p>
<p>There are some great moments. Judy Garland has a fantastic voice, of course, and is a perfectly fine actor, and a very good <em>physical</em> actor, it turns out.</p>
<p>A great voice, rubbish songs, unfortunately. Getting her to sing a song that includes the word &lsquo;somewhere&rsquo; does not make it as good as the song she&rsquo;s most famous for.</p>
<p>Honestly, that and the song-within-a-film-within-the-film (&lsquo;Born in a Trunk&rsquo;, I think it was called) are as much as I remember about the music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of keen to see if the seventies or twenty-tens versions are better. I&rsquo;ve got to imagine they must be.</p>
<p>Shorter, anyway</p>

			 <p>Wordy, as I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/08/18/the-runes-of.html">mentioned before</a>. Long. Unnecessarily repetitive.</p>
<p>But I enjoyed it nonetheless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite glad, though, I don&rsquo;t have the other books yet. I feel it&rsquo;s best to take a break after a story like this. Let it sink in. Prepare yourself, maybe, for the next one.</p>
<p>Anyway, more of the same: The Land is in danger, Linden Avery&rsquo;s son is in Lord Foul&rsquo;s clutches, and she&rsquo;s prepared to do just about anything to save it, and him. But especially him. I expect we&rsquo;re going to see a situation where she puts the whole Land — the whole of Earth, indeed — in danger, by trying to save Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Maybe she already has.</p>
<p>Oh: people have <em>far too many different names</em> in this. I mean, names by which various people refer to them. In the very last chapter someone refers to &lsquo;The Timewarden&rsquo;. I was like, &lsquo;That sounds like The Doctor; what the hell is going on?&rsquo; But they just meant Thomas Covenant.</p>

			 <p>Normally speaking I&rsquo;d claim <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141920078">a novel written in the 1930s and set in the late 40s</a> for science fiction. But this doesn&rsquo;t quite reach the threshold. There are around three obvious things that are futuristic: a reference to the Anglo-Nicaraguan war of 1946; &lsquo;air mail&rsquo;,  where a package sent from London is dropped into a field in Sussex; and the astonishing combination of phone and television, allowing the callers to see as well as hear each other! Or rather, one caller to see the other, since phone boxes don&rsquo;t have &lsquo;television dials&rsquo; (but must at least have cameras).</p>
<p>Oh, and the train service has become rubbish, not because of the car or Beeching, but because (wealthy) people mostly fly.</p>
<p>But all that is nothing compared to how funny and overall good this novel is. Stella Gibbons wrote many other novels, but all of them are out of print but this, which is a great shame.</p>

			 <p>I started reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473619777">this</a> a few years back, and stopped after the first chapter or so, because it seemed too similar to the thing I was trying to write at the time. I didn&rsquo;t want to be overly influenced, or worse, unconsciously plagiarise it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s always been in the back of my mind. And recently I&rsquo;ve been trying to get back into that novel I was working on then, and finding it difficult. So I thought maybe reading the space opera I backed away from because it was too similar to my own nascent space opera would be just what I needed to get me kickstarted.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t quite happened yet (maybe because I read it on holiday), but I loved the hell out of this.</p>
<p>Great characters you enjoy spending time with. A plot that&rsquo;s just believable enough, with stakes that are high for the characters and then get higher. An interesting, believable galactic political background, with Earth as very much the minor player.</p>
<p>None of the nonhuman characters feel really <em>alien</em>, except from in their physical descriptions, but that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to read <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781408871775">this</a> since I read a review of it back when it came out, in 2017. So, six years on, I finally did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly slight, given all the fuss and praise. I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with Saunders before reading that review, but he is famous for his short stories. I&rsquo;ve read a few of those since — at least one during <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">my MA</a> — and they&rsquo;re  fine, but to my mind tend to suffer from the problem that many short stories have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/short-stories/">mentioned this here before</a>, though seemingly only once. Often, when I read a short story — even, or perhaps especially, by one of the supposed greats of of the form: Carver, Hemingway, even Chekhov — I&rsquo;m left thinking, &lsquo;So what? What was the point of writing that, and why did you leave it where you did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, I recognise the skill that it takes to conjure a life, a character, in few words. And Saunders makes good use of that ability here. Because the story is not very much about Abraham Lincoln. It&rsquo;s not even that much about his son, Willie, who is the one who is actually in the &lsquo;bardo&rsquo;, a place where souls wait after death in some schools of Buddhism. Rather, it&rsquo;s about some of the other souls that are trapped in the same Washington graveyard. We get a whole host of compressed backstories.</p>
<p>And we get altogether too many quotes from books and articles about Lincoln and the death of his son. I haven&rsquo;t investigated to see whether these are from actual Lincoln biographies, histories of the American Civil War, and so on, or they are cleverly invented by Saunders. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_in_the_Bardo">This Wikipedia article suggests it&rsquo;s a mixture</a>.) But I found them much less interesting than the stories of the dead souls. A few would have been fine, for background, but it feels like they make up about half the book.</p>
<p>More stories about the dead, please.</p>

			 <p>Forty years ago it was: towards the end of school, Watty — <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/02/12/pennyfarthings-and-paranoia.html">he of the Number 6 badge, celebrating <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Prisoner<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> — turned me on to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does he not believe in?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everything!&rsquo; said Watty with relish.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get into the first book. There was an early section where I ground to a halt. But I went back to it, and ripped through the five books of the two trilogies that were out yet.</p>
<p>Then I had to wait. This is largely why I try not to start a series before its author has finished writing it. Those weeks and months through the first year of uni were interminable. (Only in that one regard, though, to be fair.)</p>
<p>There was a guy on my corridor in the halls of residence who was similarly waiting, and when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->White Gold Wielder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came out, he bought it at once.</p>
<p>In hardback. I was shocked by the profligacy, and didn&rsquo;t emulate him. Besides, it wouldn&rsquo;t have matched my paperbacks.</p>
<p>But after he&rsquo;d read it, he lent it to me. I wish I could remember his name.</p>
<p>So it should be clear that I liked the books a lot. However, I was thereafter corrupted by the general consensus that these were not well-written books, not a good example of the genre.</p>
<p>And yes, sure, they&rsquo;re not particularly well-written. Donaldson can be over-wordy and repetitive at times. But he knew how to weave a tale that gripped me.</p>
<p>And now, forty years hence, after my son had borrowed my old copies and read them (including my paperback of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->White Gold Wielder<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I bought to complete  the set, but have never read, since I never reread the series) he discovered (something which I vaguely knew) that Donaldson had written a &lsquo;final&rsquo; trilogy. Which has since turned into a tetralogy. I don&rsquo;t know when that happened. This volume that I read — my son&rsquo;s — says it&rsquo;s three volumes.</p>
<p>So how is it? Pretty damn good, actually. A copious &lsquo;What Has Gone Before&rsquo; leads off, and reminds me how much I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> remember about the original six books. And then — well, I don&rsquo;t want to get into spoilers, but after the first hundred or so pages, it&rsquo;s a real page-turner for the next four hundred or so, and leaves me keen to know how it all ends.</p>
<p>So expect more of this stuff here, in due course. This time, it&rsquo;s all finished, and there will be no need for me to wait for a final volume.</p>

			 <p>It’s like China wanted to write a police procedural, a detective story. But being China, there was no way it could be set in the quotidian world of today.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780330534192">Which is great.</a>. The setup here is that there are two cities, Besźel an Ul Qoma, somewhere in Eastern Europe; but they both occupy the same space. People in on can’t interact with those in the other.</p>
<p>That’s about as much as I knew about it before I started.</p>
<p>In another way it feels it&rsquo;s kind of an extended metaphor for how we don&rsquo;t notice things that are right under our noses. Or, as my beloved said, just for how we can live in a city like London alongside people from other cultures, people who look and dress differently, who even move differently; and never interact with them</p>
<p>This is both good and bad, of course. Or can be both or either depending on the circumstances. Because we&rsquo;re ignoring other people, whole swathes of them. The live their lives, full, rich, desperate, happy, sad; and we know nothing of them. They know nothing of us. Yet we don&rsquo;t get in their way. We don&rsquo;t interfere with them. We let them get on with their lives, and they us with ours, not causing them problems, as they cause us none.</p>

			 <p>To tide me over until the new Strike book comes out (in just under two months) I suddenly decided to reread JK&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781408704202">single non-pseudonymous, non-magical book</a>.  It&rsquo;s over a decade old now, which is kind of hard to believe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still bloody heartbreaking. How she can make us feel so much for so many flawed characters (but especially one or two) in so few words, never stops amazing me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slice of small-town England, in which a parish council member dies, leaving the titular vacancy. And all that proceeds from that. It shouldn&rsquo;t be as compelling as it is, based on that description. But there you go.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/05/29/films-books-blogging.html">mentioned in May</a>, that I had been reading this. It&rsquo;s taken me till now to finish it.</p>
<p>In another sense it&rsquo;s taken me a lot longer: I first started reading it in 2004. Back then I was <a href="https://devilgate.org/2005/10/20/postexam-comedown.html">doing an Open University literature course</a>. In one module an extract from <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780140434279">Daniel Deronda</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> was one of the options for us to write about. I think I must have chosen it, because my tutor sung its praises, saying it was a great one to read over Christmas, &lsquo;curled up next to the fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So I bought it and started it at the time. I can be fairly sure of this, as the bookmarks I found in it, when I picked it up back in May, were a pair of old-school paper train tickets from 2004. Two markers, of course, because this is a classics edition with comprehensive endnotes.</p>
<p>The main bookmark was around page 200, so I got a decent way into it. Except this is a book of over 800 pages, so actually not that far. I don&rsquo;t know why I stopped. Probably just got distracted by other books and petered out. I started from the beginning again this time, and found I remembered almost nothing of what I read nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<p>But enough meta story about my history with the book. What of the book itself?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really two main interwoven stories. The title character appears briefly, wordlessly, in the first scene, and then is not seen again for the whole of the first book (it was originally published serially, and is internally divided into eight books). First we get the start of the story of Gwendolen Harleth, a young woman of fair but limited means, who might expect to marry well. Until her family falls into poverty.</p>
<p>Her story at times feels like it&rsquo;s going to be a conventional, Austenesque romance. It is not, of course: it&rsquo;s much more complex than that.</p>
<p>The other story is about how Daniel Deronda rescues a young Jewish woman from self-inflicted drowning, and finds her a home, and what follows from that. This section is largely about the way Jews were treated at the time (the 1870s), and the idea that they might seek a homeland. The start of Zionism, in effect. Deronda is sympathetic to the plight of the Jews generally, as he is to Mirah, the woman he rescued. But then, he&rsquo;s synmpathetic to just about everyone.</p>
<p>The darkest part of this story shows us how terrifyingly restricted, locked down, controlled, a married woman could be in those times. the husband in question is not physically violent, he simply controls all aspects of their lives, and hence her life. She has no hope of escape. It&rsquo;s powerfully understated, and all the more chilling for that.</p>
<p>Some sentences are overly long by modern standards, and some of the language is complex or old-fashioned enough to be confusing, but it usually becomes clear with careful reading. And it doesn&rsquo;t detract from the power of the storytelling.</p>

<p>I first heard of Mike Myers in 1985 or so, at the Edinburgh Fringe.
Someone was giving out flyers for a comedy show (I know, at the Fringe,
right?) If I remember correctly it was the opening night that evening,
at St John&rsquo;s on Prince&rsquo;s Street.</p>
<p>A comedy duo called Mullarkey and Myers. We had probably heard of Neil
Mullarkey, and there was an added incentive: a free bottle of Moosehead
beer (owing to the Canadian nature of one of the performers) if you
turned up with the flyer.</p>
<p>I don't remember anything about the show, but the name and its
existence stuck. Years later came <em>Shrek</em>, in which the same Mike Myers
did a Scottish accent for no very obvious reason. I assumed he had
learned it that year in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way he made this, too. It's fine, but I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/02/05/our-man-flint.html">already
watched <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our Man Flint<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this year</a>, so&hellip;</p>

It&rsquo;s 800 pages and I&rsquo;m around the 200 mark.</p>
<p>I started reading something else after Eastercon — did I mention I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastercon">Eastercon</a> this year? Oh, yes, <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/04/07/on-my-way.html">I did</a>, but only briefly. it was in Birmingham, but not in the heart of the city with its many curry restaurants. It was at the Hilton Metropole, out near the airport and NEC.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the guests of honour was Adrian Tchaikovsky, who I&rsquo;ve been aware of but never read for lo! this several years. He seemed personable and interesting, and my friend Simon recommended his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Children of Time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Turned out I already had that on my Kindle from some offer, so I started it.</p>
<p>And I stopped after about a third. I just wasn&rsquo;t really enjoying it. The spider characters were kind of interesting, and the human ones much less so, and I just didn&rsquo;t care that much about the plot.</p>
<p>Then I discovered that it&rsquo;s the start of a series (or at least that it has sequels, which is not necessarily the same thing). That just put me off more, because if I&rsquo;m not that interested in 400 pages or whatever, how much <em>less</em> interested am I going to be in three times that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in the business of reading things because I &ldquo;should&rdquo;, either because they&rsquo;re in some way classic, or just because I&rsquo;ve started them. Sorry Adrian, sorry Simon.</p>

			 <p>I bought <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781911310990">this</a> on my <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/04/09/conventions-conventionally-drink.html">recent visit to Eastercon</a>, from one of the authors, David Wake.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about the possibility of self-publishing before this, but Wake was on a panel about what to watch out for when you first get a publishing contract (his point: nothing, if you self-publish). He made some good points about the advantages of doing it yourself versus the traditional publishing route. For example, you don&rsquo;t send your sample chapters and synopsis in then wait two years for someone to decide. And even if they say yes, it could be another two years before your book is published.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which way I&rsquo;ll go with my <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/04/06/just-after-midnight.html">recently-finished draft</a>, but I thought it was worth spending a fiver on this to check out the possibilities. And it seems a decent guide to how you can approach publishing both ebooks and paperbacks, for minimal outlay.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go into things like cover design and marketing, which, of course, are some of the things that traditional publishers handle.</p>
<p>I might give it a spin, though, with a novella that I&rsquo;ve got sitting around. We shall see.</p>
<p>Anyway, take a look at this if you&rsquo;re interested in the possibilities. <a href="https://punkpublishers.com/">Their website is here</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an excellent followup, with a very good summary of the previous novel at the start, which is useful. Top quality SF with politics. Scotland, and the Union (the EU++), are expanding into interstellar space, joining the other two power blocs.</p>
<p>Like the last, and perhaps even more so, this ends in a place that is quite satisfying. No cliffhangers, and if there were no more books, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Though at the same time it&rsquo;ll be great to see what happens in book 3.</p>

			 <p>Just after midnight last night I finished my novel, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Casino Soul<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The first draft, anyway, or maybe only the zeroth draft. There&rsquo;s a lot to do to make it anywhere close to <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>But that can wait for later. For now I&rsquo;m feeling a combination of elation and deflation.</p>
<p>92,000 words and two years elapsed. Writing takes time.</p>

			 <p>Atkinson&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life After Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2014/03/26/the-first-three.html">wonderful</a> story of Ursula Todd, who kept repeating her life, dying in different ways each time. One interpretation or explanation for this strange experience is that she was trying to create (or find, or reach) a version of her life in which her beloved brother Teddy survives the Second World War and lives to grow old.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780385618700"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A God in Ruins<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> is the story of that timeline.</p>
<p>Or maybe a couple of timelines. While this is in most ways a more straightforward tale than its predecessor, we do see two or three possible different endings for Teddy. It&rsquo;s also about his descendants: his daughter the infuriating Viola, and her two children. It&rsquo;s kind of a redemption tale for some characters.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the bits about Teddy&rsquo;s wartime expreiences as a bomber pilot most. Overall it&rsquo;s not as good as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life After Life<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but not bad.</p>

<p>That case, though, is interesting. It was a sex-discrimination one<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> where the discriminated-against party was a man. He was a carer for his elderly mother, and the fact that he had never been married meant he wasn&rsquo;t entitled to a tax credit, where a woman would have been.</p>
<p>Ginsburg was able to convince the judges to declare the law unconstitutional, as it discriminated arbitrarily, on the titular basis. And with the ACLU, she was then able to tackle the many laws that discriminated similarly against women. Clever.</p>

<p>Or gender-discrimination, as they renamed it, because &lsquo;sex is all over the brief&rsquo;, and it would distract the judges — male, of course; at least, according to the film. And I wonder if we can draw a line of causality from that decision to the position of gender in the culture today.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781446420874">The Rings of Saturn</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a very unusual book. My copy has this classification on the back: &lsquo;Fiction/Memoir/Travel&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Well make up your mind, I might say!</p>
<p>And yet, it is all those things, and the combination makes a compelling, readable whole. Sebald (or the narrator) goes on walks around Norfolk and Suffolk. Along the way his thoughts carry him on paths that both parallel his physical ones and diverge far from them in both time and space. He muses on history, architecture, biography, geology, ecology, and much more.</p>

			 <p>To Cambridge, on Thursday just past, and to the Corn Exchange, to see Suzanne Vega. My one-word review: spellbinding.</p>
<p>I had never been to the Corn Exchange before (to be honest I&rsquo;ve rarely been to a gig — especially an indoor gig — outside London these last thirty-six or so years). But it&rsquo;s one of those places that feels slightly legendary to me, because I&rsquo;d see it listed among the tour dates in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sounds<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NME<!-- raw HTML omitted --> back in my youthhood.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s a lovely, clean, modern venue, with Old Speckled Hen on tap. We were seated in the balcony (on the balcony?), which was fine.</p>
<p>And as to Ms Vega: I&rsquo;m not steeped in her work, so the fact that she essentially played a &lsquo;Greatest Hits&rsquo; set was ideal for me. She even explicitly said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna play some of the well-known ones early, so people don&rsquo;t worry that they won&rsquo;t get them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This after she&rsquo;d opened with &lsquo;Marlene on the Wall&rsquo;, followed by &lsquo;Small Blue Thing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She had one accompanying musician, a guitarist called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Leonard">Gerry Leonard</a>, who has worked with Bowie, among others. He was great, making heavy use of those sampling/looping pedals, making him sometimes sound like three or four players at once.</p>
<p>So, like I say, the whole thing was spellbinding.

			 <p>Watty was  wearing a badge, one of the big, old kind. Probably two inches across, round. They used to advertise them in the back of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sounds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NME<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Record Mirror<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and I think there was a fourth member of the British weekly music press, but I can&rsquo;t recall it). They always included the size, in old-fashioned imperial units: one-inch, two-inch. Probably inch-and-a-half.</p>
<p>In the early days we wore the big ones. My first one was almost certainly a Beatles one, but I don&rsquo;t remember what design it had. I do recall a glittery Thin Lizzy one, when I went through my period of them being one of my faves. Wings, maybe? Probably.</p>
<p>Anyway, with punk, the badge size that was considered cool, or even acceptable, reduced. Anything bigger than an inch across would lead to mockery, for sure. Although I think Brendan&rsquo;s Stranglers badge, saying &lsquo;Something Better Change&rsquo; (&lsquo;Because I like the song and I like what it says&rsquo;) was of the two-inch persuasion, but that was in the early days.</p>
<p>Watty&rsquo;s one, the one that I&rsquo;m talking about: that was probably even earlier. It was white, with the outline of what I had to get quite close to realise was a penny farthing bicycle. And a number: 6.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that about, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/158671"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Prisoner<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>! Do you not know about it?&rsquo; Watty wasn&rsquo;t too bad in this way, but the default reaction to someone being ignorant of something you liked was mockery, back then, when we were 13, 14. To be honest, probably for a decade or more after that, too. Instead of the healthier attempt to infect the ignorant one with our own enthusiasm. Or at least inform them about it.</p>
<p>I learned, though, that it was a weird programme that was on late at night, and anyway it was over now, so even if it hadn&rsquo;t been on at a time that I wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to stay up on a school night, it was finished, so there was no chance I&rsquo;d ever get to see it.</p>
<p>Pity.</p>
<p>Of course, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Prisoner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was originally broadcast in 1967-8, so if Watty was watching it ten years later, it does show that repeats were a thing. If only there were a way we could have our own copies of TV programmes. But what a fantastic, farcical idea!</p>
<p>I know it was the early days, because the name &lsquo;The Prisoner&rsquo; did not immediately make me think of The Clash. The <a href="https://song.link/i/688798635">B-side</a> of &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/i/647246391">(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais</a>&rsquo; shares a title with Patrick McGoohan&rsquo;s paranoid cold-war ex-spy drama. I don&rsquo;t think it has anything else in common with it, but you can&rsquo;t be sure.</p>
<p>I finally saw some episodes in the early nineties. I bought some on VHS, along with my friend Johnny, who also hadn&rsquo;t seen it. But that didn&rsquo;t prove very practical, as we live in different cities. And VHS was expensive. Two episodes per tape for, what fifteen quid? So that petered out.</p>
<p>Much later I got the DVD box set. And it&rsquo;s been one of the things we&rsquo;ve been watching over the last few months. Er, years, maybe. It might have started in lockdown.</p>
<p>Tonight we finally watched the last two episodes. Which were much better than I had been led to believe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of amazing, saturated as it is with sixties fears about mind control, brainwashing, hypnotism. Is anything real after the unnamed main character gets gassed in the opening of the first episode (repeated in the opening credits of almost every episode)? Maybe the whole thing is a hallucination induced by the gas, you know?</p>
<p>There are certainly plenty of actual induced hallucinations or dreamlike states in the series. Which is why you can&rsquo;t trust the increasingly psychedelic ending.</p>
<p>The whole thing is a mindfuck. I loved it.</p>

<p>I remember seeing this as a kid and absolutely loving it. We talked about it at school, probably played at being Flint.</p>
<p>It’s a Bond spoof. James Coburn as Flint is a super agent who is brought out of retirement to save the world from some mad scientists who are controlling the weather.</p>
<p>I only remembered two things about it. His ability to stop his heart for maximum rest, and the device in his watch that got him started again; and his lighter, with ‘82 functions… 83 if you want to light a cigar.’</p>
<p>It’s daft nonsense, but fun in places. There’s even a lesser agent called 0008 (Triple Oh Eight) who tells him ‘It’s bigger than SPECTRE.)</p>

			 <p>First, cards on the table, Bob is a friend of mine. <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780957217409">Bomber Jackson Does Some</a> is his first novel, self-published in 2012. He gave us a copy back then, and it&rsquo;s taken me till now to read it.</p>
<p>Just because of the size of my to-read piles, not any quality concerns.</p>
<p>Bomber is an ex-boxer and an alcoholic. At the start of the novel he has just got out of prison. As you might imagine from such a setup, things largely go downhill from there. His thoughts include a fair amount of slang, some of which I didn&rsquo;t understand, but the meaning was usually clear from context. For example, he refers to two homeless men as &lsquo;real old-fashioned paraffins&rsquo;. Paraffin lamp = tramp, I assume.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written in first person, present tense, which I think is quite a hard voice to sustain. Bob does a good job of getting us inside Bomber&rsquo;s head, and the story flows along at fine old rate.</p>
<p>All in all, top stuff. Recommended if you can get hold of a copy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m shocked that I posted less than 100 times, but there you go. I&rsquo;ve been busy with other things.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other Things</h2>
<h3 id="writing-a-novel">Writing a Novel</h3>
<p>What time I had for writing outside of work, I tried to spend mainly on completing my novel. You&rsquo;ll recall that I did a <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">Creative Writing MA</a> in 2020–21. I graduated in May 2022. My <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/09/17/dissertation-submitted.html">dissertation</a> was essentially the first 15,000 words of a novel (along with a preface on how it had all come together). I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/12/17/at-the-start.html">promised myself</a> that I&rsquo;d finish it by the end of the year. I haven&rsquo;t quite achieved that goal, but I expect to in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<h3 id="new-job">New Job</h3>
<p>But to that &lsquo;outside of work&rsquo;, above: I started a new job in February. I never quite got round to writing about it here, except on my <a href="https://devilgate.org/now/"><code>/now</code> page</a>, which is an infrequently-maintained page that&rsquo;s meant to say what I&rsquo;m up to at any time. I was and am glad to have it, of course, but it&rsquo;s amazing how much working 9–5:30 again takes away from your ability to do other things.</p>
<p>The job itself? I was employed as a Java Developer — that&rsquo;s literally in my job title — and I have written precisely zero lines of Java.</p>
<p>Instead, I found myself plunged into the exciting new world of infrastructure as code, or IaC, and the <a href="https://www.terraform.io">Terraform</a> language. I might write more about that at some point, but in short, it seems I work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> now, and I&rsquo;m enjoying it.</p>
<h4 id="digression-on-writing-at-work">Digression: On Writing at Work</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written over 70,000 words of a novel over the past year-and-a-half or so. But since February I&rsquo;ve written something like 100,000 words at work. This comes from keeping copious notes on what I&rsquo;ve being doing and what I&rsquo;ve learned, and so on. I thank <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> for making it easy to do so, and for working in a way that matches how I want to work. But I wonder: why didn&rsquo;t I keep notes like this before? I always wrote things down, of course, but not this systematically, this comprehensively.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mystery.</p>
<h3 id="jury-duty">Jury Duty</h3>
<p>In May I spent three weeks on a Jury at <a href="https://hornseyhistorical.org.uk/wood-green-crown-court-what-was-there-before/">Wood Green Crown Court</a>. That was an interesting experience. I might write more about it one day.</p>
<h3 id="etc">Etc</h3>
<p>And all the other things that make up life. Hey, I even read <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/books-2022/">33 books last year</a>!</p>

			 <p>Not just <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/12/30/knives-out.html">another</a> murder mystery, but an undeniably cosy one. OK, the deaths aren&rsquo;t cosy, obviously, but the mood and vibe of <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780241988275">the book</a> certainly is.</p>
<p>The club in question is made up of four residents at a retirement village. They start out by speculatively investigating cold cases that a former member, who had been a police officer, had records of. But soon a hot case lands right in front of them, and things get interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious in places, moving, well-plotted, and, let&rsquo;s face it, a tad unconvincing. But you don&rsquo;t let that bother you while you&rsquo;re reading it.</p>
<p>Which you should do.</p>

			 <p>As any fan will realise instantly, the title of this comes from Lou Reed&rsquo;s &lsquo;Romeo Had Juliet&rsquo;. So that&rsquo;s going to draw my interest right away. Then from the blurb we learn that Lou himself is a character in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781617756429">the story</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s a kind of coming-of-age novel about a seventeen-year-old boy from Queens in 1976 or so, who moves with his mother to Manhattan, and into the block where Lou Reed is also living. The boy, Matt, becomes something of a friend/assistant to Lou for a while.</p>
<p>In a parallel narrative, Matt falls for a girl at his new school, who might be involved in some withcrafty kind of stuff. It&rsquo;s not obvious exactly how the timelines of the two strands relate, but things come to a head — or a couple of heads, you could say.</p>
<p>The book closes with a chapter entitled &lsquo;Afterwords&rsquo; (note the plural) in which the narrator — or the author — writes after Lou&rsquo;s death. This section makes it seem as if the early section was based on real events. The author is a successful actor, so who knows?</p>
<p>I want to quote this from that last section, about Lou&rsquo;s music, because I love it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And more than anything else, it was punk. Which should come as no surprise since you were its creator. I don&rsquo;t care what Detroit says, you were doing it when Iggy was a mere Osterberg and Kramer was trying to figure out who the other four would be. As for the lads from my neck of the woods (famous for their <em>&ldquo;One, two, three, four&rdquo;</em> count-off and three power chords) who are considered by some as the progenitors of the movement… well, that just makes no sense chronologically or otherwise. Not to mention (but I will) that they basically wrote the same song over and over again. And however great a song it may be, it renders deep catalog cuts redundant. Sorry, kids, I guess you had to be there—on the Bowery when it happened. But I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the same goes for the little London boy. Just the first few sentences you speak to the audience on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Take No Prisoners<!-- raw HTML omitted --> relegates John-John to a corner with some crayons and a finger up his nose. The revolution you started was one of art and intellect. It inspired the defeat of tyranny in Czechoslovakia, for Christ&rsquo;s sake. God save the queen, indeed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;The little London boy.&rsquo; 😀</p>
<p>Something about the length, the writing style, and the age of the narrator, suggests that this book should or would be considered young-adult (YA). But the Lou Reed connection makes it much more likely that people in my age group will be drawn to it. I don&rsquo;t know what that means.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it, anyway. And it was a Christmas present from my daughter.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m quite pleased to have read as many as 31 books this year. Not sure quite how I&rsquo;ve managed it, what with writing my own, and starting a new job, and all. Partly a lot of rereading of page-turners, of course.</p>
<p>Le Guin&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780426064374">Rocannon&rsquo;s World</a> was not a reread for me, though I&rsquo;ve had it on my shelf for years. Bought second-hand, I&rsquo;m sure, I don&rsquo;t recall where or when, but it&rsquo;s an edition from 1978. And it&rsquo;s a super-slim volume. It probably wouldn&rsquo;t be classified as a novel at all, in today&rsquo;s publishing world. It&rsquo;s kind of a slight story, about a person from an advanced species — an Earth-human, essentially — getting stranded on a planet at bronze-age levels of technology, with various species of native humanoid.</p>
<p>The titular Rocannon has to make his way across the world to find the other high-level aliens who have caused him to be stranded, avenge himself, warn his people about their aggression, and maybe try to get rescued.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s maybe most notable for being, I believe, the place where Le Guin first used the term <em>Ansible</em> for s faster-than-light communication device. She went on to use it in many other novels, and other SF authors adopted it.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s also the name for something in IT automation. Infrastructure as code. Of which concept, though not Ansible, more later, probably.</p>

			 <p>I missed posting this yesterday, what with one thing and another. Twenty years ago yesterday, the 22<!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of December 2002, my friend Tony texted me and the other members of our then-band, Burn, to the effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nooooooooo!</p>
<p>Strummer&rsquo;s dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was at work, and immediately googled for the story.  Joe Strummer, dead at 50 from an undiagnosed heart defect. We didn&rsquo;t hear the reason at once, of course.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://devilgate.org/2002/12/23/the-death-of.html">The Death of a Hero</a> at the time. Not much has changed, in some ways. I still play his music, both The Clash and his solo stuff. I sometimes wonder what he&rsquo;d have to say about the times we live in now.</p>
<p>Hard to imagine he&rsquo;d have been 70 this year. Such is life, and death.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s amusing, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526643155">this one</a> coming straight after <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/11/22/the-books-of.html">this year&rsquo;s behemoth</a>, since the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/11/22/jerusalem-by-alan.html">last book I read by Moore</a> was a similar year-spanning (and reading-year-consuming) monster.</p>
<p>This one, however, is much more straightforward and shorter read than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jerusalem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a book of short stories. Or more accurately, a book containing some short stories and one that is more or less long enough to be a novel on its own.</p>
<p>That one — &lsquo;What We Can Know About Thunderman&rsquo; — is a fractured history of the US comics market. It tells of the two big companies — American and Goliath — and a few smaller ones that mostly got gobbled up over the years. American famously has the eponymous Man of Storms as its most famous character, along with King Bee, Moon Queen, and many more.</p>
<p>We get the stories of how various young fans attend conventions and end up as professionals, and what happens to some of them afterwards. But why are some odd things happening to people who work for American?</p>
<p>That one&rsquo;s the centrepiece, but I think my favourite might be &lsquo;American Light — An Appreciation&rsquo;. Subtitled as &lsquo;by C. F. Bird&rsquo;, it presents an annotated version of a poem, the &lsquo;American Light&rsquo; of the title, by a beat poet called Harmon Belner. In 26 pages and 86 footnotes, Moore manages to give us a pretty good beat poem, and tell parts of at least two life stories. You&rsquo;ve got to read all the footnotes, though.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The other stories are good, too. &lsquo;The Improbably Complex High-Energy State&rsquo; takes place in the first femtoseconds of the universe.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> &lsquo;Location, Location, Location&rsquo; is the story of an estate agent and her client after the world has ended.</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>

<p>I was mildly distracted by this text early in that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pioneering 2 Tone band rose thanks to the support of Joe Strummer,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> who invited them to support the Clash live,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While not wrong, it ignores the fact that The Specials were bloody brilliant! The piece does make that clear later, to be fair, but it seems slightly the wrong way to weight it.</p>
<p>I also listened to some Fun Boy Three, and they were far better than I remembered, too, both with and without Bananarama.</p>

<p>When I was a little kid my family used to go on holiday to
<a href="https://millport.org">Millport</a>, on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Cumbrae">Isle of
Cumbrae</a>,
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Clyde">Firth of
Clyde</a>.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t go to the cinema often, if ever, back then. But Millport had
a small cinema, and we always went once or twice when on holiday.</p>
<p>I don't recall any of the films we saw in the four years we holidayed
there. What I <em>do</em> remember is the film posters, because they were
always there, so I saw them year after year. And unusually, they were
round the walls inside the auditorium. So while you waited for the
lights to go down, you saw adverts for films that once shown there.</p>
<p>It's where I first heard of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dollars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> trilogy. Only the first two
then, in a double poster for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Fistful of Dollars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For a Few
Dollars More<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When Eight Bells Toll<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ice Station Zebra<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And one called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matt Helm Gets it in Denmark<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I eventually saw all the
others, but not that one. As I got a bit older, if ever the name came
back to me, I wondered what kind of &lsquo;getting it&rsquo; the title referred
to. I probably kind of looked like an adventure film, so it was probably
more likely to be a threat to his life, than any other interpretation.
But the <em>entendre</em> was clearly <em>double</em>.</p>
<p>I recently found that our Roku has a strangely-named channel called
&lsquo;Movieland Tv&rsquo; [<em>sic</em> as far as the lowercase &lsquo;v&rsquo; goes]. I had
a poke around, and it seems to specialise in old movies from the 60s and
70s that are not what might now be called classics. Though there are a
couple of Bond films: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thunderball<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the first Bond film I ever saw) and
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Diamonds are Forever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But I came across one called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Silencers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The blurb described it as
&lsquo;The first Matt Helm movie&rsquo;. Well! Here was the mysterious figure from
my childhood. If not getting it in Denmark, then at least in danger of
being silenced. The blurb also told us he was an agent who&rsquo;d got out of
the game and his superiors wanted him back.</p>
<p>Fair enough, sounds like it could be OK, and I fancied something like a
spy film tonight.</p>
<p>The first surprise was the star: Dean Martin. Now, that poster back in
Millport <em>might</em> have shown his name in large type, and if it did you&rsquo;d
think the collision of his last name with my first would have stuck with
me. But if so, that fact is lost in the mists of memory.</p>
<p>After an opening where four hit men are given bullets with &lsquo;Matt Helm&rsquo;
written on them, it starts with a woman dancing. And, basically,
stripping. It&rsquo;s obviously trying to be like a Bond opening scene, but,
way sub-even-that-standard.</p>
<p>And then another woman starts singing, and the credits include original
songs by Elmer Bernstein, and a choreographer. Is this a musical?</p>
<p>Well, no, but if you&rsquo;ve got Dean Martin in the studio, you&rsquo;d be daft
not to get him to sing a bit. Which he doesn&rsquo;t do in character, but
does in a couple of scenes in voiceover, in effect. Oh and there&rsquo;s a
joke with Sinatra coming on the radio and Helm saying, &lsquo;Turn that off,
I can&rsquo;t stand his voice.&rsquo; They retune, and a Dean Martin song comes
on, and he says. &lsquo;Now this guy can sing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I know, it&rsquo;s not much of a joke.</p>
<p>It's a daft spy romp, and from Helm&rsquo;s amorous adventures, I think
it's now clear which kind of &lsquo;getting it&rsquo; will be happing in Denmark.
Though probably a bit of both.</p>
<p>I'm giving it one star for making me laugh several times, though mainly
at the ridiculousness. And half a star for the fantastic mobile bed. Why
move to answer the phone when you can flick a switch and have your bed
rotate you to where it is? And when you want to have a bath, just let
your bed take you there and drop you in.</p>
<p>Honestly, that bit wouldn&rsquo;t have been out of place on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Island">Tracy
Island</a>.</p>
<p>Other than that, it&rsquo;s complete mince.</p>

			 <p>I am unreasonably happy about having finished this before the end of the year. I started reading it at the start of the year. In fact, possibly before the start of the year, since it was a Christmas present.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ve read <a href="/categories/books-2022/">28 other books</a> while intermittently dipping into this behemoth, something I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/02/13/raw-spirit-in.html">alluded to</a> once <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/03/16/the-schrdingers-cat.html">or twice</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a historical novel set in the middle and end of the 18th century, telling the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Frank">Jacob Frank</a>, a Polish Jew who led a cult, or alternative religious community if you prefer. He converted to Islam, then to Catholicism, taking his followers with him on the second of those changes. But they remained &lsquo;true believers&rsquo;, treating Frank as the true Messiah.</p>
<p>It took me so long to read partly because it&rsquo;s so long, and certainly not because it was uninteresting. In fact it&rsquo;s surprisingly compelling, considering the subject matter. But it is complex. Not least because of all the Polish place names and names of people. The latter is compounded when they get baptised into the Catholic church. They take on new names, so now most characters have two sets of names.</p>
<p>I got a surprise when I first picked up the book to find that it&rsquo;s numbered backwards. Chapter 1 of Book 1 starts on page 892. The story ends on page 27. (There are some notes and blank pages after that.)  At first I thought I might have to read it &lsquo;backwards&rsquo;, but no: the story proceeds in the direction I&rsquo;m used to. It&rsquo;s just the numbering.</p>
<p>I wondered if this was a reference to the direction of Hebrew writing, and Tokarczuk&rsquo;s note at the end confirms that it is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as well as a reminder that every order, every system, is simply a matter of what you&rsquo;ve got used to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is fair enough. I quite liked knowing how many pages I still had to go, with having to subtract. Especially as I got near the end.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, in the last couple of weeks I read this in  &lsquo;<a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/shift-happens/issues/some-good-news-1458208">Shift Happens</a>&rsquo;, a newsletter about a book about keyboards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(in Poland and parts of Europe, books have their tables of contents at the end, and so will mine).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which isn&rsquo;t the case here, but I thought it was an interesting slightly-connected idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge work, in more ways than one, and also an incredible example of the translator&rsquo;s art.</p>

			 <p>Since Musk&rsquo;s takeover of Twitter has been confirmed, there has been a lot of chatter about free speech. Musk, we are told, describes himself as a &lsquo;free speech maximalist&rsquo;, and there are fears that he&rsquo;ll have Twitter reinstate the accounts of Trump and other white supremacists.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Joe Strummer.</p>
<p>More specifically, I&rsquo;ve been wondering why his &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1443369287">The Road to Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll</a>&rsquo; was popping into my head so often. It wasn&rsquo;t a problem: getting an earworm of a song I like doesn&rsquo;t bother me. But I wondered what was triggering it.</p>
<p>I can often work out why I get a song in my head. I knew, for example, why I often had The Clash&rsquo;s &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/gb/i/688798635">The Prisoner</a> ' in my head through the summer. The words &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner">The Prisoner</a> ' are written on the whiteboard in our kitchen, along with the titles of the other serieses we&rsquo;re watching.</p>
<p>And in fact I sing &lsquo;The Prisoner&rsquo; every time I hang out the washing, owing to its line referring to &lsquo;hanging out the washing and clipping coupons and generally being decent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It clicked today, though. You know how — if you&rsquo;re an old-school album listener (or just old) like me — when you play an album, one track&rsquo;s ending often triggers the expectation of the next? So that, when you hear a song in isolation, on a playlist or on the radio or something, and the wrong song plays next, it can be quite jarring?</p>
<p>The song before &lsquo;The Road to Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll&rsquo; on <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1443368778"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rock Art and the X-Ray Style<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> is &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1443369281">Techno D-Day</a>&rsquo;. Joe&rsquo;s celebration of illegal raves ends with the line, &lsquo;And this is about free speech!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So it turns out my head was just playing the next song whenever the phrase came up.</p>

			 <p>And so I circle back and reread the book I read <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/09/12/the-ink-black.html">just over a month ago</a>.</p>
<p>This has been a most enjoyable experience, reading through the whole series. Rereading this one so soon was an excellent opportunity to see if I could spot any clues that I missed the first time (certainly one or two).</p>
<p>The apparent logical jumps the characters make at the climax made more sense this time, so that was good.</p>
<p>Excellent stuff. I look forward to the next one.</p>

<p>Martin McDonagh&rsquo;s latest is sad, hilarious, tragic, and true. Or feels like it could be true, even if some of the decisions characters make are baffling, to say nothing of gruesome.</p>
<p>On a rugged, beautiful island off the coast of Ireland in 1923, with the civil war going on on the mainland, two friends fall out. Or rather, one says he doesn&rsquo;t like the other any more. A whole sequence of events flow out from this simple, almost child-like choice.</p>
<p>The funniest part happens when one of them goes to confession.But that&rsquo;s only to be expected: confession&rsquo;s a pretty funny kind of thing, when you think about it.</p>

			 <p>For some reason this is the one whose title never sticks in my mind. When I try to think of the books in the series I always seem to have a hard time bringing this one to mind.</p>
<p>Which is by no means because of the story, which is excellent. Strike and Robin take on a cold case, 40 years old. <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/05/19/troubled-blood-by.html">When I wrote about this before</a> I said I thought there was too much time spent on the other cases. That didn&rsquo;t seem so this time.</p>
<p>Also back then, I was recovering from being sick. This time I was just starting to be. And indeed, I was reading a section where Strike gets flu and tries desperately to convince himself that he <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be getting it; to no avail, of course. I was reading that and thinking, &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m definitely getting it.&rsquo; <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/10/06/well-damn-as.html">And not flu</a>.</p>

<p>Politics is the background for this one, with Robin going undercover at the House of Commons to try to find out who&rsquo;s blackmailing a government minister — or rather, why? The blackmailers are known, but nobody outside of the minister&rsquo;s family knows what it is they have on him.</p>
<p>All good stuff, as ever. I had totally forgotten who was behind it all (where &lsquo;it&rsquo; is the murder that follows the blackmail), which just goes to show you can easily enjoy a whodunit <a href="https://devilgate.org/2018/10/04/lethal-white-by.html">a second time</a>.</p>

			 <p>God, I have missed this <em>so</em> much. Live music FTW.</p>
<p>I get emails from the <a href="https://joestrummerfoundation.org">Joe Strummer Foundation</a> . The most recent one told me that their <a href="https://joestrummerfoundation.org/gemma-rogers-jsfs-featured-artist-for-september/">artist of the month for September</a>  was someone called <a href="https://www.gemmarogersmusic.com">Gemma Rogers</a>. I hadn&rsquo;t heard of her, but was interested when I read that she&rsquo;d had an album launch at <a href="https://paperdressvintage.co.uk">Paper Dress Vintage</a>. That&rsquo;s a place just down the road from me on the Narrow Way. It used to just be a second-hand clothes shop, but now it&rsquo;s more, I guess.</p>
<p>Anyway, the thought that she might be a local piqued my interest, as well as the JSF recommendation, so I gave her a listen, and liked what I heard a lot.</p>
<p>She was booked to play at a place called <a href="https://www.folklorehoxton.com/info">Folklore</a>, on Hackney Road, so I thought, why not? In support was <a href="https://www.gabigarbutt.com">Gabi Garbutt and the Illuminations</a> , who I saw once a few years back, because <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/336678-Sean-Read">Sean Read</a>, whom I know from round these parts, was producing them and playing in the band. Back then. Not anymore. Not tonight, at least.</p>
<p>Going to a gig in a small venue? No big deal, right? Except… this is the first gig I&rsquo;ve been to since I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/03/01/glen-matlock-remembers.html">saw Glen Matlock</a>. At the end of February 2020.</p>
<p>It felt like quite a step.</p>
<p>But after a bite to eat across the road, we made our way in through forbidding, castle-like doors. Inside is a smallish bar area, and a classic pub backroom. The stage made of two layers of forklift pallets topped with hardboard. It was smoky. Visually, it was like being back in the eighties. But of course, it was stage smoke-machine smoke. Exactly why it filled the air before anyone had taken to the stage escapes me.</p>
<p>Unless it was to show the lasers. It looked like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway, Veronica  Bianqui brought her Hollywood-fuelled LA tones to Hackney Road. Though it turned out she had been on the bus with us down from Clapton.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I probably enjoyed Gabi Garbutt&rsquo;s performance most of the three. Because at times? At times they sounded a bit like late-period Clash.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They sounded. Like. The Clash. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Combat Rock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-era. I think it was mainly the bass player sounding a bit like Paul Simonon. Whatever, I can pay no higher compliment. No higher compliment <em>can</em> be paid.</p>
<p>But Gemma Rogers was also great, with the singalong of &lsquo;Rabbit Hole&rsquo; being the highlight. Not often you get the band applauding the audience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But yes: I had missed it so much more than I realised. Just getting together in room with a hundred or so people, while others make rocking sounds up the front? How could I have forgotten?</p>

			 <p>I surprised myself, really. I, an avowed republican and atheist, watched the Queen&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>It was a historic event, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that. If only because we need reminding once in a while that we live in a militarist theocracy.</p>
<p>Sure, the Prime Minister — elected, but just barely having any democratic legitimacy — was involved, reading one of the weird stories from the strange Christian book, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bible<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But look at the start of the ceremony. The military led the march to the church, surrounding the coffin throughout. Just inside the doorway they handed over to the religionists, who led them down the aisle.</p>
<p>All the living Prime Ministers were there, and some other politicians too, I expect. But it was not a day for them, for the elected; nor for their electors, for &lsquo;commoners&rsquo;, except to bow their heads and throw flowers.</p>
<p>I kept an eye on Twitter throughout, but it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as snarky as I imagined. A few comments about dropped papers and spiders, but mostly just revelling in it.</p>

			 <p>So we move into a(nother) period of rereading. Reading the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/09/12/the-ink-black.html">new Strike novel</a> immediately made me want to go back to the start. Mainly, I think, because I wanted to stay with these characters. As I type I&rsquo;ve just finished the second in the series.</p>
<p>The characters, though, are very different back here. Well, Strike not so much. Robin is new-minted, still unformed, and doesn&rsquo;t get nearly as much pagetime as she deservedly does in later books.</p>
<p>Good stuff, this tale of a famous model who dies in a fall from a balcony. The police have written it off as suicide, but Strike, when asked to investigate, has other ideas.</p>
<p>Keeping the whodunit alive, I had completely forgotten who actually was the guilty party. Or rather, I remembered it as being someone other than it was. So I was surprised by it, which you don&rsquo;t really expect on a rereading.</p>

<p>Aaron Sorkin not quite at his best. Decent film, based on the memoir of Molly Bloom. Who is nothing to do with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ulysses<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but parents who either were huge James Joyce fans, or had no knowledge of him whatsoever. I lean toward the latter.</p>
<p>She nearly becomes an Olympic skier, but is put out of action by injury. She falls into helping to run a poker game for extremely rich people. Takes it over and it becomes even bigger, even richer.</p>
<p>Even more dangerous. The mob gets involved. The FBI get involved.</p>
<p>Great dialogue, as you&rsquo;d expect, but mostly presented by characters who are seated, rather than walking at high speed. Perhaps playing poker while walking at high speed would have improved the whole thing.</p>
<p>Not bad, though.</p>

			 <p>This may be the best so far of the Strike books. My favourite so far, anyway.</p>
<p>Despite being set in 2015 (time flows differently in Galbraith world) it&rsquo;s very much of now. People being bullied online, right-wing terrorist organisations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossrail">Crossrail</a> still being built. Oh wait, they finished that. If the novels ever catch up with reality, Cormoran and Robin won&rsquo;t have to pick their way past roadworks around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_Street">Denmark Street</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://strikefans.com/the-tottenham-pub/">The Tottenham</a> pub won&rsquo;t be there any more. What will Strike do then? Well, OK, he&rsquo;ll just complain about it being renamed The Flying Horse, I imagine. I think I was in The Tottenham once, years and years ago, and didn&rsquo;t think too much of it. But who knows.</p>
<p>Anyway, the book! Yes, it is excellent. I loved it. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t like was the sheer physical size. It&rsquo;s over 1000 pages, and when it&rsquo;s not breaking your wrists, it feels like it&rsquo;s breaking its own spine.</p>
<p>The titular Ink-Black Heart (it should, of course, be hyphenated, as an adjectival phrase) is a cartoon series, initially on YouTube, moved to Netflix. Having read the description, I really want to see it.</p>
<p>It spawns a fan-created game, and therein lies the problem. Fans, you know? They can be troublesome types. Even dangerous.</p>
<p>Parts of the book are presented as in-game chat threads, with up to three streams running in parallel down the pages. It could get very confusing. It doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>

			 <p>Yes, I&rsquo;m only reading Iain Banks at the moment. What of it? Or I was for a brief period up until the book after this.</p>
<p>Probably my favourite Culture novel, and possibly the best. Mainly because the ships are most prominent and coolest and it&rsquo;s all just huge <em>fun</em>!</p>
<p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2013/10/16/201431.html">talked about it back in 2013</a> god how can this have been going on for so long? Where by &lsquo;this&rsquo; I mean <a href="/blog/tag/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a>. On the other hand, I suppose as long as I reread his books, it&rsquo;ll be going on, no matter how many &rsquo;re-' prefixes we might want to apply.</p>
<p>There are a couple, though none of the SF, that I&rsquo;ve still only read once. I think maybe literally a couple: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stonemouth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Quarry<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And one, the poetry collection (with <a href="/blog/tag/ken-macleod/">Ken McLeod</a>), that I&rsquo;ve only partly read.</p>
<p>But anyway, <a href="https://theculture.fandom.com/wiki/Excession_(novel)"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Excession<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>: pure dead brilliant. If by some odd means you&rsquo;ve read his SF and haven&rsquo;t got to this yet, you have a treat in store for you. Or if you&rsquo;re just starting out. Or if you&rsquo;re re-re-rereading, like me.</p>

			 <p>Banksie&rsquo;s most political book, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say. In the sense that the real-world politics and opinions of the author and the first-person narrator most closely align, and that it was written at about the time it is set and is often <em>about</em> the time it was written, as well.</p>
<p>It starts on 9/11, though that tragic event is only background. A London-based Scottish radio DJ and commentator gets up to mischief and into trouble.</p>
<p>It stands up well twenty years on.</p>

			 <p>The last of the Culture books and Banksie&rsquo;s SF books, both at all, and that I had only read once.</p>
<p>The odd one about this, as a Culture book, I realised only very late on, is that neither Special Circumstances nor even Contact are involved, directly. Just a random grouping of ships who take an interest in the matter.</p>
<p>The matter in question being the decision of a species called the Gzilt to sublime, or leave the material realm for higher dimensions. This a common endpoint (or new beginning) for civilisations in the Culture universe, and I wonder whether, had Iain lived, he would have taken us to the point where The Culture itself was making that decision.</p>
<p>Anyway, the sonata in question is one that is barely playable because it was written for &lsquo;an instrument not yet invented&rsquo;, which turns out to be be the Antagonistic Undecagonstring, or Elevenstring. An instrument with some 24 strings (some not counted in the name, because they are not played, they just resonate) designed to be played with two bows simultaneously.</p>
<p>Our hero — or at least, the main humanoid viewpoint character — Vyr Cossont, has been surgically adapted to have an extra pair of arms to allow her to play it. It is still next to impossible, but she has made it her &lsquo;life task&rsquo;: something to do while waiting for the day when your civilisation sublimes. The decision for them to go was made long before she was born.</p>
<p>But her playing the sonata is only a side issue. The real problem is that maybe someone is trying to sabotage the sublimation. Or maybe not, but odd things are afoot, and various people and ships get involved, and it&rsquo;s all a whole shitload of fun.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">my MA course</a>, in the Creative Nonfiction module, we were assigned the first chapter of this as one of our readings. It intrigued me enough that I ordered a copy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pagesofhackney.co.uk">Pages of Hackney</a> had to order it from the US, and it took a long time to arrive. The module (and possibly the course, though I don&rsquo;t actually think so) had finished by the time it arrived.</p>
<p>It took me even longer to finish reading it, despite it being a very slim volume.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s subtitled &lsquo;The Art of Personal Memoir&rsquo;. She starts one section by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thirty years ago people who thought they had a story to tell sat down to write a novel. Today they sit down to write a memoir.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it was published in 2001, so she was seeing a change since the seventies. That may be even more true now, as creative nonfiction, memoir, the confessional story: that&rsquo;s a huge publishing category.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure to what extent this book will help people who want to sit down and write one.</p>
<p>Gornick likes to teach by example. I would estimate that between 40 and 50% of the words in this book are other people&rsquo;s. All properly cited and credited, of course, and the relevant permissions listed at the back. But she uses huge long quotes.</p>
<p>Nothing inherently wrong with that, of course. How else do we first learn to write at all, other than by the examples of things we read? But I felt she spent too much time quoting the examples, and not enough explaining <em>why</em> she chose those. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe use smaller examples, or break the big quotes up with interjections on technique.</p>
<p>Early in the book she talks about the nonfiction writer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here the the writer must identify openly with those very same defenses [<em>sic</em>] and embarrassments that the novelist or the poet is once removed from. It&rsquo;s like lying down on the couch in public … Think about how many years on the couch it takes to speak about oneself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The casual synecdoche of &lsquo;couch&rsquo; to mean &lsquo;therapy&rsquo; or &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; amused me. So commonplace must analysis be in her circles, that she assumes everyone knows what &lsquo;lying down on the couch&rsquo; is like. Whereas most of us, I would guess, only know about it from seeing it in films.</p>

			 <p>Not strictly a book, but a <a href="https://interzone.press">double issue of a short-story magazine</a> seems substantial enough to treat as one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when the last issue came out, but I had actually forgotten that I still had a subscription. It was good to get this, not least because it&rsquo;s going to be the last to be edited by Andy Cox and published by TTA Press — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interzone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 2.0, we might call it, after the David Pringle years.</p>
<p>From the next issue the editor will be Gareth Jelley, and the publisher MYY Press. The surprising thing about that is that the press is based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw">Wrocław</a>, in Poland. Which is odd because then, is it a British SF magazine anymore?</p>
<p>That probably doesn&rsquo;t matter, because of course it&rsquo;s an international genre, and it&rsquo;s not like they ever only published British writers. But still, quite a dramatic shift. It&rsquo;ll be intersting to see how the magazine changes.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this a lot. There was perhaps too much <a href="https://twitter.com/glassworks18">Alexander Glass</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> — three stories and an interview — but I guess sometimes you have a special focus for an issue (or two). And they&rsquo;re all good.</p>
<p>Several of the stories suffer from something I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/2014/07/21/notexactlybooks-what-has.html">complained about before</a>, which is to say, they don&rsquo;t have endings. Or, put another way, the authors chose to end them at a point that I find unsatisfying; or I don&rsquo;t understand <em>why</em> they chose to end there.</p>
<p>But in this case, I don&rsquo;t think any of the ending-choices let the stories down too. much.</p>

			 <p>This starts out with the main character escaping from some obscure threat and reaching a friend&rsquo;s place. The friend sends him into the past — so you think it&rsquo;s going to be a time-travel story. In the past he tries to save a struggling artist by giving him gold.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the last we hear of time travel. It&rsquo;s actually a story of humans who have attained bodily immortality through various traumatic incidents, and things going on with them. There&rsquo;s some space travel, and, not surprisingly given the tite, a computer connection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty strange in the way that Bester can be. Not one of his best, but interesting enough. Harlan Ellison praises it — and Bester — highly in the introduction.</p>
<p>I had one of those, &lsquo;Have I read this before?&rsquo; experiences through the first few chapters, but it soon stopped. So I wonder if I started it once before. If so, I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;d have stopped, as it kept me going this time.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;ve read any of Priest&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dream Archipelago&rsquo; stories before now. Certainly the <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/christopher-priest/">ones that I&rsquo;ve tagged with his name</a> are all outside of that loosely-connected set. But you can&rsquo;t have been interested in <a href="/blog/tag/sf">SF</a> as long as I have and not be aware of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://christopher-priest.co.uk/books/the-islanders-2">This one</a>, though, well.</p>
<p>Its conceit is that it is a gazeteer of the Dream Archipelago (which is, I&rsquo;m slightly surprised to discover, what its residents call it: I had thought it was more… <em>dreamy</em> than that).</p>
<p>The archipelago is essentially impossible to map, because of some kind of time-distorting vortices that occur over the world it is on. No one is sure how many islands there are or the names or locations of even the main ones. The writers of the gazeteer try their best in any case.</p>
<p>By way of the would-be-factual entries, plus a number of fairly straightforward short stories (which don&rsquo;t fit the gazeteer format, but then nothing really &lsquo;fits&rsquo; here) we get something of the backstory of the archipelago, and fragments of the lives of a few of its prominent citizens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all highly readable and makes me want to know more about this odd world and its people (who seem to be essentially human).</p>

			 <p>&lsquo;<a href="https://www.valmcdermid.com/still-life/">A Karen Pirie thriller</a>,&rsquo; the description on the cover says of this. I&rsquo;m not sure &lsquo;thriller&rsquo; is quite the right term. It&rsquo;s exciting enough, but there isn&rsquo;t the tension that would take it up to &lsquo;thriller&rsquo; level. Not least because Karen Pirie is never in any danger, other than possibly pissing off her boss, the deputy chief constable of Police Scotland.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read Val McDermid before, so picking up one of her later ones — possibly her latest: published in 2020, set just before the pandemic, and ending as lockdown starts — would be a strange choice. But sometimes you&rsquo;re in a holiday house and there are some books and it&rsquo;s not so much a choice as an offering. I&rsquo;ve fancied checking out some <em>tartan noir</em> for a while, anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. I enjoy a crime novel from time to time, and this one certainly kept the pages turning. Backstory was filled in very efficiently, without it feeling like infodumping. And reading about the chill autumn in Scotland (with slight detours into France, the north of England, and Ireland) took the edge off some of the Greek heat.</p>
<p>The title is a little confusing. There is some art involved in the story, but none of it is a still life. There&rsquo;s at least a double meaning to the phrase, of course, and that makes sense in context. But maybe the French term, <em>nature mort</em>, is even more applicable. Not least since Karen Pirie works cold cases for the Scottish police force.</p>

			 <p>Greece is probably the best place to read <a href="https://pollysamson.com/books.htm">this novel</a>, which is good, because that was where I was when I read it. It&rsquo;s a work of fiction mostly set on the real island of Hydra during 1960-61. There was a famous community of anglophone expats there at the time, one of whom was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Ihlen">Marianne Ihlen</a>. They were notably joined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Cohen">Leonard Cohen</a>.</p>
<p>The first-person narrator is fictional, but nearly every other character is real. It&rsquo;s an unusual approach for a contemporary novel, though perhaps not for historical fiction. Which, at sixty years distance, you could consider this. Some of the people are still alive, though, which is probably what makes it feel a bit odd.</p>
<p>Not Leonard or Marianne, though. The books starts with the narrator visiting Cohen&rsquo;s old house on the morning after his death was announced. Which — and I had forgotten this — was just after Trump got elected. Everything else is flashback.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very good. Captures the feeling of a Greek island summer, the listlessness of the young drifters, and the bitterness of the older writers who still struggle for success.</p>

<p>This time round it was fine, and so was the second one, but not really anything to write home about. I&rsquo;ll read the other two, since I&rsquo;ve got the combined edition on my Kindle, and they&rsquo;re not very long. But there&rsquo;s a spark that Rucker has when he writes about things like infinities, that just isn&rsquo;t there when he writes about the themes here.</p>
<p>Which are artificial intelligence, machine sentience, and the possibility of transferring human consciousnesses into robot bodies and vice versa. Those are fascinating concepts, but the stories don&rsquo;t quite jump off the page enough for me.</p>

I think just because of the similarity of names.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ubik<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> is in fact more of a mid-period novel (written 1966, published 1969), and it shows. Though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik">according to the Wikipedia entry</a>, &lsquo;it was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest novels since 1923.&rsquo; I find that a tad surprising, as it&rsquo;s far from one of his better ones to my mind.</p>
<p>Certainly some of his tropes are there: strange warps to reality, confusion over who is and isn&rsquo;t dead, that sort of thing. But it&rsquo;s just not as compelling as, say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Scanner Darkly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; nor as weird and fascinating as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VALIS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The characterisation is weak — which is probably true for most of Dick&rsquo;s work, to be fair. But the story just doesn&rsquo;t really get off the ground.</p>

<p>So I started with the famous opening sentence I wrote about. But because I linked to the book&rsquo;s Wikipedia page, I skimmed the article. Which mentioned a prologue, that I had somehow missed.</p>
<p>As it happens, missing the prologue didn&rsquo;t really matter, didn&rsquo;t affect my enjoyment of the book. But first, I don&rsquo;t know how people can refer to the first sentence of Chapter 1 as the opening sentence, when there&rsquo;s a prologue full of sentences before it.</p>

			 <p>With its fairly famous opening line — &lsquo;I had reached the age of six hundred and fifty miles.&rsquo; — I kind of thought I had read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_World">this</a> before, long ago, maybe as a teenager. But no. It turned out definitely not.</p>
<p>A young man learns his place in a city — Earth City, as they call it — which is moving. Rails are placed before it and lifted up behind it so they can be laid in front again. The city is winched along on the rails by fits and starts. Why? Why is it in motion, and why do the inhabitants work desperately to keep it so? And why is the fact kept hidden from city dwellers who are not &lsquo;guildsmen&rsquo;?</p>
<p>The answers, or some of them, are within. Though there is no answer to why &lsquo;guildsmen&rsquo; is the correct word. Women are second-class citizens in the city. And worse outside it, on the whole.</p>
<p>The people of the city are human, they speak English mostly. They know their ancestors were from Earth planet, as they refer to it. The people in the villages they pass also seem to be human, and they mostly speak Spanish. The sun appears not as a sphere, but as a kind of disk with spikes top and bottom. What can be going on? The title suggests some kind of inversion, but what is it?</p>
<p>Ultimately the mystery isn&rsquo;t solved in a very interesting way, and the ending is sad, but maybe happy, but maybe sad.</p>
<p>Priest has written much better books, but it bears reading.</p>

			 <p>This was prompted by a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article — listicle, you might say, since it&rsquo;s basically a big list — of books for the summer (last summer): <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/summer-reading-the-50-hottest-new-books-everyone-should-read">Summer reading: the 50 hottest new books everyone should read</a>. I borrowed it from my local library. Kind of great that you can borrow ebooks from the library. Especially during lockdowns, when the buildings themselves were closed.</p>
<p>It is a magic realist novel set mostly in Britain and faerie; or the <em>sidhe</em>, as it&rsquo;s called here. It starts with the story of the tragic death of the main character&rsquo;s sister, when they were both in their late teens or early twenties. Was it murder? certainly the driver of the car that killed her was imprisoned.</p>
<p>The loss of her sister haunts Taryn&rsquo;s life, predictably. But if there are hints that the death is somehow linked to the other mysteries that run through the book, then it is never satisfactorily resolved that there is or isn&rsquo;t any connection.</p>
<p>That aside, we soon find ourselves — unexpectedly, for me at least — in another world. It seems that all the otherworlds exist: Munin and Huggin, Odin&rsquo;s ravens, turn up. We hear that &lsquo;The Great God of the Deserts&rsquo; went mad because his believers had too many different ideas of what he was like, so heaven is closed. A visit to purgatory is made.</p>
<p>Taryn finds out she is damned, because of an action she took — or didn&rsquo;t take, a sin of omission — regarding her sister&rsquo;s killer. And seems to accept this, and another evil at the heart of the Sidhe, without trying to understand it, without raging against it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, but there are definite weaknesses. I found the action scenes very confusing. Some of the geographical descriptions, too. And it feels a bit… maybe <em>unfocused</em> is the word? Hard to say what exactly I mean by that, but I guess it&rsquo;s that some things are hinted at when they should be explained. At least eventually.</p>
<p>There are a few oddities. It&rsquo;s set mostly in Britain, but some Americanisms creep in where they wouldn&rsquo;t. Can&rsquo;t think of any specific examples, but it&rsquo;s on the level of saying &lsquo;highway&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;motorway&rsquo;. That kind of thing.</p>
<p>Well worth a look, though.</p>

			 <p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to write anything about Elon Musk buying Twitter, because I mostly don&rsquo;t care. But Robin Sloan, in his newsletter, which isn&rsquo;t really a newsletter, because he just sends a link to a <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lostthread/">blog post</a> (with a few added words), says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An industrialist intends to purchase Twitter, Inc. His substantial success launching reusable spaceships does nothing to prepare him for the challenge of building social spaces. The latter calls on every liberal art at once, while the former is just rocket science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to quote that because I loved &lsquo;just rocket science.&rsquo; The common expression, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not rocket science&rsquo; has always mildly amused me, as a physics graduate. Because rocket science is <em>relatively</em> both simple and easy. It&rsquo;s straightforward Newtonian physics. Mass. Acceleration. Forces. The physics is simple, the sums are easy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go anywhere near even Special Relativity (still straightforward, if harder), General Relativity (much more complex), or of course anywhere close to quantum physics (frankly the most complex and confusing thing of all).</p>
<p>All of which is just to say that physics has more and less difficult areas. Rocket <em>engineering</em>, of course, is quite another matter. There you&rsquo;ve got all sort of complex materials science, chemistry, end even — if crew are involved — biology, sociology, psychology. Those are <em>much</em> harder.</p>
<p>As far as common similes for the ease of something go, I&rsquo;ve always preferred &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not brain surgery.&rsquo;  If I think about it I&rsquo;m amazed that operating successfully on a living human brain is even possible, and I bow my head to those who can do it. While hoping they&rsquo;ll never have to go near said bowed object, of course.</p>
<p>Anyway, that would have been that for this post, except that I pasted the above quote from Sloan into a text editor. But it didn&rsquo;t look like it does above. It looked like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>An indus-tri-al-ist intends to pur-chase Twit-ter, Inc. His sub-stan-tial suc-cess launch-ing reusable space-ships does noth-ing to pre-pare him for the chal-lenge of build-ing social spaces. The lat-ter calls on every lib-eral art at once, while the for-mer is just rocket science.
</code></pre><p>Where did all those hyphens come from? They look like they&rsquo;re non-printing characters. Ones that won&rsquo;t show up when a web page is rendered, but are there in the source code. Why? I can only imagine two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>a deliberate ploy to make it harder to copy quotes, as I have done above. But Sloan is a pro-web kinda guy, as far as I can tell. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like something he&rsquo;d do.</li>
<li>A glitch. An artifact of the software he used to create the post. It&rsquo;s most likely that. Weird one, though.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stranger still is that the character is not even a hyphen. As I discovered when I search-and-replaced it in BBEdit, it actually appears to be this: <code>\x{AD}</code>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that is. Some kind of hexadecimal representation of something. An invisible hyphen, presumably. Which I had to search-and-replace with actual hyphens to make them visible above. Looking at the source code, it&rsquo;s written as the HTML entity <code>&amp;shy;</code>, which the DuckDuck tells me is a &lsquo;soft hyphen&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All very odd.</p>
<p>I have positive feelings about Sloan, except for his closing image. I&rsquo;ll risk another paste:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wishful descriptions of Twitter as 	<!-- raw HTML omitted -->“the de facto public town square”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“the closest thing we have to a global consciousness”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sound, to me, like Peter Pan begging the audience to clap and raise a swooning Tinkerbell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don’t have to clap.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, but… of <em>course</em> you have to clap. Without wanting to get all metaphysical on you, if you don&rsquo;t clap when Tinkerbell is dying, you&rsquo;ve got no soul.</p>

			 <p>This came to me by way of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/summer-reading-the-50-hottest-new-books-everyone-should-read">summer reading</a> recommendations last year. I ended up reading it in the tail end of winter, or spring, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/15/luckenbooth-by-jenni-fagan-review-brilliantly-strange?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">his review</a>, M John Harrison describes it as &lsquo;brilliantly strange&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s about right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tale told across times, and tied to place. That place is number 10 Luckenbooth Close, in Edinburgh. Just off The Royal Mile, in fact, which is a place I lived as a student. I was in an alley called James Court, though, not the fictional Luckenbooth Close.</p>
<p>The close may be fictional, but the idea is not: <a href="https://luckenboothsedinburgh.co.uk/history/">luckenbooths</a>  were a kind of market stall in the High Street (part of The Royal Mile). Presumably that&rsquo;s where Fagan got the street name from.</p>
<p>Though I discover today that a luckenbooth is <em>also</em> a piece of jewellery: a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luckenbooth_brooch">heart-shaped brooch</a> , named after the <a href="https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luckenbooths">market stalls</a> in turn.</p>
<p>The book, though, is about none of those things. Instead it&rsquo;s about a series of people who live in the titular tenement block across the centuries. We start with the Devil&rsquo;s daughter, who — well, I won&rsquo;t go into spoilery details. William Burroughs is one of the characters, strangely. Apparently he <a href="https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/06/10/burroughs-and-scotland/">did visit Edinburgh</a>.</p>
<p>It is an astonishing work, involving the saving of ghosts, murders, the Millennium celebrations, homelessness, and much more. Highly recommended.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a strange set of opinions popping up on Twitter over the last week or so, essentially blaming the US, the UK, and/or NATO for Putin&rsquo;s illegal and horrifying war on Ukraine. Which on the face of it is bizarre, at best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that NATO&rsquo;s expansion over the last couple of decades was unwise. Yet who could blame small countries close to Russia from seeking the protection that membership brings? Putin&rsquo;s belligerence was well known even before the current attack.</p>
<p>George Monbiot makes the point well in his excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a strong argument that Nato should have been <a href="https://socialeurope.eu/what-is-nato-for">disbanded</a> at the end of the cold war. But while Putin’s sense of threat seems to have been heightened by Nato expansion and mission creep, Nato expansion has also been driven in part by Putin’s belligerence. Are we really to believe that Estonia and Latvia joined because they wanted to attack Russia? On the contrary, it’s because they fear attack. While Nato’s growth is likely to have contributed to the crisis, it’s ridiculous to suggest that Russia is not the aggressor.</p>
<p>&ndash; George Monbiot, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin">We must confront Russian propaganda – even when it comes from those we respect</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He suggests that Russian propaganda is at least partly to blame. It seems have made inroads on the left. Monbiot mentions the Stop the War Coalition, which normally we would think is an admirable goal and organisation. But their recent <a href="https://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/list-of-signatories-stop-the-war-statement-on-the-crisis-over-ukraine/">letter</a> claims the British government &lsquo;have poured oil on the fire throughout this episode.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m no supporter of Johnson or the Tories, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair. They also say that they &lsquo;do not endorse the nature or conduct of either the Russian or Ukrainian regimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the Ukrainians have done except prepare to defend themselves, and then do so. I&rsquo;m as against war as any former CND member from the eighties, but when a country is invaded, it has a right to fight back.</p>
<p>Monbiot says it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True anti-imperialism means opposing not only the west’s imperialism, essential as this is. It’s about opposing all imperialism, whether western, Russian, Chinese or other.</p>
<p>&ndash; George Monbiot, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin">As before</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As always, of course, it is the ordinary people who suffer. I recommend donating if you can, to one of the organisations working to help the people of Ukraine:</p>

			 <p>I remember seeing Brunner at a convention 30 years ago, or more, talking about &lsquo;the death of the midlist&rsquo;: how writers who sold their work steadily to publishers, and to readers, used to be able to make a living from doing so, but no longer could. I wonder what he&rsquo;d make of the publishing scene today.</p>
<p>Anyway, this slim book from 1966 hides its science-fictional nature till almost the very end. Unless you&rsquo;ve read the blurb. Or indeed, this post, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Productions_of_Time">the wikipedia entry about it</a>. A theatre actor, a recovering alcoholic not long out of a sanatorium, gets the chance to work with a hip writer and director.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to get a troupe together, coop them up in a house in the country, and work collaboratively to construct a play.</p>
<p>Or at least, that&rsquo;s what they want the cast members to think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad, if a little inconsequential.</p>

			 <p>An Agatha Christie book from 1961, and set round about then, too. We start in Chelsea espresso bar, where the main narrator, Mark Easterbrook, observes a fight between two beatnik/proto-hippie rich girls, and the first clue is sneaked in.</p>
<p>Easterbrook is no famous detective, though, either professional or amateur. He&rsquo;s a historian who is trying to finish writing a book. But things happen, and soon the action moves to the English countryside where its author is most comfortable.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>He meets Ginger Corrigan, who the blurb describes as &lsquo;his sidekick&rsquo;, which suggests to me an ongoing series and many adventures. And maybe that&rsquo;s what Christie had planned, who knows. But this is standalone.</p>
<p>Anyway, the titular Pale Horse is a former pub where three women live, and perhaps cast spells. Certainly they give seances and such. But are they using magic to murder people remotely? Well that&rsquo;s what our heroes have to find out, of course.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m finding season 2 of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Severance<!-- raw HTML omitted --> quite annoying. The pacing is glacial. Every episode, I wait for something to happen, and they pile up more mysteries. Very slowly.</p>
<p>Take episode 7, for example, where they filled in Mark &amp; Gemma&rsquo;s backstory. All very nice, but completely unnecessary. We already knew they&rsquo;d been a loving couple. We knew she was dead, and that she&rsquo;s not actually dead. They didn&rsquo;t need to spell out every little detail. What&rsquo;s going on with her now is intriguing, but I no longer even care much about <em>what</em> is going on, just <em>why</em>? And <em>when</em> are they going to burn that fucking Lumon cult to the ground?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this idea with modern &lsquo;prestige TV&rsquo;, that telling a story (or adapting a book) as an eight- or ten-episode series is better than trying to squash the same story into a two-hour film. And there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for that. Give the story room to breathe.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Severance<!-- raw HTML omitted --> spends too much time listening to its own breathing.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind all this so much if I knew how much more of it there was to go, and that there was a fully-planned story, and that it <em>would actually get made</em>. I&rsquo;ve not forgotten the deep disappointment of <a href="https://devilgate.org/2019/12/15/oa-going-away/">Netflix&rsquo;s completely random cancelling of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The OA<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>. And there we know Brit Marling had the whole thing planned out across five seasons.</p>
<p>Also the reason for my title: it&rsquo;s trying too hard to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twin Peaks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and failing. You&rsquo;re not David Lynch. No one is any more. Stop it, and just tell the story. A bit quicker.</p>

			 <p>There was a post about how &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t post your way out of fascism&rsquo; that did the rounds a few weeks ago. I have a feeling it might have done some harm.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read it in detail. Saw the headline, skimmed it, got the gist. Resistance to Trump/Muskism and the other right-wing authoritarian risings around the world: it needs more than tweets, toots, blog posts.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>But not everyone <em>can</em> do more, or give more. And even those who can, or could or should: for some of us, writing is not just what we do, it&rsquo;s what we <em>are</em>. We <em>need</em> to write. And I know I&rsquo;ve felt some discouragement a few times lately, when I might have written about Trump, or Musk&rsquo;s nazi salute, or the general horror of things. I&rsquo;ve thought, &lsquo;Yeah, but &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t post your way…&quot;&rsquo;</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say my memory, my knowledge of the existence of that post has <em>stopped</em> me posting. Other things, or a combination of things, have done that. But it&rsquo;s in there, like a spectre at the writing table, saying, &lsquo;No, this isn&rsquo;t enough, so you shouldn&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is almost certainly not what the writer intended. But I think it&rsquo;s unhelpful at best, and may be harmful to some people at worst.</p>
<p>Posting won&rsquo;t be enough to get us out of fascism, but it might help some people to get <em>through</em> it.</p>
<p>So please, everyone, don&rsquo;t be discouraged; and don&rsquo;t stop posting.</p>

			 <p>As <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL59863W/The_Dispossessed?edition=key%3A/books/OL24938050M"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Dispossessed<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> starts with a wall, <a href="https://www.jeffvandermeer.com/book/annihilation/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Annihilation<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> starts with a tower. And as LeGuin&rsquo;s wall round a spaceport both closes the planet off from the rest of the universe, and encloses the universe, depending on how you look at it; so VanderMeer&rsquo;s tower has its topological oddity. It starts at ground level and goes down, into the ground underneath it, rather than rising into the air.</p>
<p>Or so the Biologist sees it, But this is Area X, and things are rarely as they seem.</p>
<p>The Biologist is the first person narrator. Accompanied by three other women — the Psychologist, the Anthropologist, and the Surveyor — they are the latest in a series of groups sent in to investigate the mysterious zone.</p>
<p>Almost everything is unexplained in this book. It is incredibly compelling, gripping, even, but everything remains unexplained, the ending is open. Yet while there are three more books in the series, I feel it&rsquo;s such a perfect little nugget, beautifully crafted, that to read on would almost spoil it.</p>
<p>I suspect that&rsquo;s not true, though. We are in safe hands with VanderMeer, so I expect the continuation will be sound. I remember my friend Simon having a similar response when he read <a href="https://www.gollancz.co.uk/titles/dan-simmons/hyperion/9781399609500/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hyperion<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>. Its perfectly-crafted open ending seemed to him like it didn&rsquo;t need a sequel. But of course <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Fall of Hyperion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was magnificent, and so were the two <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Endymion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> followups.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is great, but you probably already knew that, what with winning awards and being ten years old.</p>

			 <p>We started watching <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Miss Austen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the {BBC serial about Jane&rsquo;s sister Cassandra](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Austen">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Austen</a>) trying to get hold of Jane&rsquo;s letters a few years after her death. That made me want to read some more Austen, the only I&rsquo;ve read before being <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pride and Prejudice<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So I tried ,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Northanger Abbey<!-- raw HTML omitted -->](<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781903025628)">https://micro.blog/books/9781903025628)</a>. Which is mainly a spoof of the gothic novels that Austen herself would have been reading at the time, and also, of course, a romance.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it a lot, but it ended very surprisingly. It has the omniscient narrator you might expect for a book of its time, but it&rsquo;s mostly written in close third-person. We are privy to Catherine&rsquo;s thoughts and fears. But the thing is, when we get to the climactic scene, when everything is going to resolved and our heroine end up happy (it&rsquo;s not much of a spoiler), Austen (or the narrator) turns away.</p>
<p>Instead of being with Catherine as the hero rides to her emotional rescue, we are told about it. We&rsquo;re kept at a distance, no longer aware of what&rsquo;s going on in her head. It&rsquo;s an absolute masterclass in the difference between &lsquo;showing&rsquo; and &lsquo;telling&rsquo; in writerly terms; but the wrong way round for a really satisfying experience.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a continuation of the style of those gothic romances she was parodying, but read today, it&rsquo;s a strange choice.</p>

			 <p>I think I read somewhere that <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526643216">this</a> ends on a huge cliffhanger. It doesn&rsquo;t. Or I wouldn&rsquo;t describe it in those terms.</p>
<p>It has an epilogue, entitled &lsquo;The Old Man at the End&rsquo;, set 50 years or so after the main story. Someone we take to be the protagonist fears for his life; and the close-third-person narration hints at or mentions some events that intrigue. But we&rsquo;re not left hanging.</p>
<p>The book <em>is</em> described as &lsquo;a Long London novel&rsquo;. though, so we certainly expect additions to the series in time.</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;Long London&rsquo; is not used in the book, I think, though our normal, everyday London is called &lsquo;Short London&rsquo; at one point. &lsquo;The Great When&rsquo; <em>is</em> used, and is one of the terms for another London that exists parallel to ours in some sense. Certain people, with certain kinds of imagination (or damage) can find and use some few portals between the two realms.</p>
<p>You know the sort of thing. Parallel worlds, unseen realities, aren&rsquo;t exactly new. But Moore is such a good writer, this is a high, fine example of the form, even if there have been others like it before. The  richness of his description and believability of his characters make this a five-star affair, if I gave stars to books.</p>
<p>And books are key here. It all kicks of in 1949, when Dennis Knuckleyard, 18 years old, orphaned in the war, and working in a second-hand book shop, comes into the possession of a book that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>It is imaginary, being named in an Arthur Machen tale. Which means he has to get it back to the other London before very bad things start happening.</p>
<p>Highly recommended, and I eagerly anticipate the next volume, despite not being cliffhung by this one.</p>

<p>Light blogging year, then, but I&rsquo;ve written quite a lot of fiction, so there&rsquo;s that. To say nothing of things like the currently-1500-word essay on <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/06/06/i-keep-thinking-i-should/">my thoughts and feelings about AI</a>, wherein I try to understand those things. That might appear here one day. I hope so.</p>

			 <p>I read about <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781852428426">this</a> some four years ago on <a href="https://jackdeighton.co.uk/2021/04/24/vivaldi-and-the-number-3-by-ron-butlin/">Jack Deighton&rsquo;s blog</a>. It sounded interesting enough that I tried to order it via <a href="https://www.pagesofhackney.co.uk">Pages of Hackney</a>. But they told me it was out of print.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t even find it on Amazon; no Kindle version. So I left it.</p>
<p>Until just recently, when I had cause to by some second-hand books from <a href="https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb">World of Books</a>. Something made me think of this one. Quick search, and there it was.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s even weirder and more fun than I imagined from reading Jack&rsquo;s review. It&rsquo;s a series of short stories, with some interconnections, about various classical composers (plus some philosophers). But it&rsquo;s all deeply surreal. You&rsquo;ll find Beethoven living in present-day Edinburgh, for example.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it all for? I don&rsquo;t really know. But they&rsquo;re great little vignettes, easily digestible, and lots of fun.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t really picked up on blogging properly since this year started. I didn&rsquo;t, for example, write a summary post about last year&rsquo;s entries, as I generally do. I&rsquo;m also behind on books updates. <a href="https://devilgate.org/2025/02/11/books-the-murder-of-roger/">The other day&rsquo;s post</a> was about a book I finished very early in January.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve been kind of off the whole thing since November or so. Maybe earlier, but the USA&rsquo;s apocalyptically stupid choice of head of state was the anti-icing on the un-cake of my feelings about the world in general.</p>
<p>I feel like I might be coming out of that downturn now. And strangely, I think I&rsquo;ve got my new blog theme to thank for it. In part, anyway.</p>
<p>It seems daft, but just freshening the place up can make a difference, you know? So thanks <a href="https://devilgate.org/2025/02/10/have-switched-my-blog-to/">once again</a> to <a href="https://micro.blog/Mtt">@Mtt</a>, or Matt Langford, for the lovely <a href="https://bayou.micro.blog/">Bayou Theme</a>.</p>

<p>Another great one from Christie, with a killer twist. Poirot has retired and is living in the country. But that kind of character never really gets to retire, do they?</p>

			 <p>This morning I read the whole of the <a href="https://archive.is/J31rj"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vulture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article about Neil Gaiman</a>. That link&rsquo;s to an archived copy, because someone said on Facebook that the original has had the references to Scientology removed because of legal threats. And also it&rsquo;s paywalled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so depressing that a man who seemed so decent, so generally a positive force in the world, can turn out to have been an abuser all these year. Allegedly, I suppose I must say.</p>
<p>You know, Paul Cornell included Gaiman as a character in one of his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shadow Police<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stories, <a href="https://devilgate.org/2014/10/12/the-severed-streets.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Severed Streets<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>.

			 <p>After my recent <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/12/15/conclave.html">viewing of the film</a> based on this, my daughter got me  <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780735273344">the book</a> for Christmas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising how compelling a book can be when you know exactly what&rsquo;s going to happen, and it&rsquo;s about something that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally give a toss about. Though on the latter, I suppose the boy can leave the church, but it always leaves its mark, or something.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out this Harris guy can really write. Who&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve thought?</p>
<p>I note with interest that the &lsquo;why this story, why now&rsquo; question that I mentioned when writing about he film, never even crossed my mind while reading this. I approach a book with a different set of expectations from how I do a film, maybe.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading several weeks ago, in fact. I&rsquo;m way behind with the change of year.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is an odd little book. I stress the &lsquo;little&rsquo; because it&rsquo;s very short. We&rsquo;re in Peru. An ancient rope bridge, of Inca origin, collapses one day, killing the five people who were crossing it. A priest, Brother Juniper, witnesses the event and decides to use it to prove God has a plan for humans.</p>
<p>The narrator, however, tells us that Juniper&rsquo;s eventual vast book on the subject was derided, destroyed, and in any case incomplete. The narrator knows things about the people that Juniper never learned. How the narrator knows these things is never stated — we might assume it&rsquo;s because the narrator is also the author, though that&rsquo;s rarely a safe assumption.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the start. The rest of the book consists of the stories of the victims and how they came to be there on that day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. Won the Pulitzer.</p>

			 <p>I laugh gently at <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/11/08/finished-reading-the.html">my past self</a>, musing that <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784971625">this volume</a>, based on its title, might have a <em>less</em> bleak universe-view.</p>
<p>Reader, it does not.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s the thing I liked least about this whole trilogy, the dark view of the universe, of sentience. The idea that every species that develops intelligence and advances to the point of thinking about space travel and the idea of possibly communicating with other intelligent species; that they would all have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide">xenocidal</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> instinct. Have it, and routinely, casually act on it, by wiping out the star systems of other species they detect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it couldn&rsquo;t be so. As one explanation for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi paradox</a> it&rsquo;s exactly that: one explanation. But it&rsquo;s just too fuckin <em>bleak</em> for my tastes.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this story, and the trilogy as a whole, is jam-packed with ideas, stuff about relativity, higher and lower dimensions, all sorts of good hard-SF stuff. The characters are kind of blank, undeveloped: I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be sticking in my memory. But I enjoyed it overall.</p>
<p>Apart from when I was annoyed/disturbed/upset by the dark forest idea.</p>
<p>Your central idea: I do not like it.</p>

			 <p>I was shocked, but not exactly surprised, by the US election result. Or no: I was surprised. I think I had somehow internalised that idea that Kamala Harris would win. It seemed unthinkable that Americans would elect Trump again.</p>
<p>But then, it seemed unthinkable that they would elect him <a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/01/20/trumpeting.html">the first time</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised though. Among the presidents in my lifetime, we&rsquo;ve had Nixon, Reagan, Bush, and W Bush.

<p>Yet America elected all of them (notwithstanding that the popular vote nearly always favoured their Democratic opponent).</p>
<p>Trump, of course, rolls the ills of all of them up into one great ugly package, and adds narcissism on top.

<p>The other odd thing is that when I added this to Micro.blog&rsquo;s Bookshelves feature, it came up with a subtitle I&rsquo;ve never heard of before: &lsquo;Remembrance of Earth’s Past, #2&rsquo;. On the book&rsquo;s title page, and in any other discussion I&rsquo;ve heard of, it&rsquo;s always referred to as &lsquo;The Three-Body Trilogy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Getting to the story itself: perhaps the least believable thing about the whole thing is the idea humans could be convinced to believe that an alien invasion force was on its way to Earth and would arrive in 450 years. To believe and act toward resisting the force or ameliorating the situation by escaping or anything else.</p>
<p>I mean, in the real world we can&rsquo;t even get people to believe in, get governments and businesses to act on, the climate emergency, and its effects are visible day by day.</p>
<p>The climate is largely ignored in this book, as well, though in the latter part, set two hundred years after the start, we see some extreme desertification in China.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty bleak in places, in its philosophy, this one; especially as regards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi paradox</a>, or a solution thereto. But it leaves us at a point where I&rsquo;m thinking, &lsquo;Where now? That feels like a decent ending.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Death&rsquo;s End<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (great title, and potentially a much less bleak philosophy, if it matches the title) is sitting waiting, all 700+ pages of it. Why does each volume of a trilogy tend to be longer than the one before?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> So we&rsquo;ll see where that takes us.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this. There&rsquo;s a lot of telling, and the characters maybe aren&rsquo;t very clearly differentiated, but it&rsquo;s full of ideas.</p>

			 <p>It seems Facebook still has the odd use, apart from keeping in touch with family and friends who still use it. I popped in late last night, and it told me I had memories on this day. It seems the 29th of October has been a day on which I&rsquo;ve often posted in the past, because there were several. But the one that really caught my eye was this one:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>15 years ago, it tells me, in 2009, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason Ringenberg doing The Clash&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ivan Meets Gl Joe&rsquo;: a thing of rare beauty. Spotify URI: <a href="http://is.gd/4Hcr7">http://is.gd/4Hcr7</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s quite telling, in several ways. First of all, remember the <code>is.gd</code> URL shortener? Remember <em>URL shorteners that aren&rsquo;t <code>t.co</code></em>?</p>
<p>Also, I haven&rsquo;t used Spotify in a long time, being a happy Apple Music subscriber. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter. What&rsquo;s really weird is that I have absolutely no memory of Jason (out of Jason &amp; the Scorchers, as I&rsquo;m sure you know) doing any Clash song, much less a surprising choice of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandinista<!-- raw HTML omitted --> album track.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> And back then was probably still in the time when was listening to Jason quite a lot.</p>
<p>Obviously I quickly searched for it on Apple Music. To find that it&rsquo;s part of an album. Not one by Jason, though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/2107226-Various-The-Sandinista-Project-A-Tribute-To-The-Clash">The Sandinista! Project</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> is a compilation album of covers of the entirety of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandinista<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by different artists.</p>
<p>Why was I not told such a thing existed?</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that I <em>was</em> told of it, one way or another. Some passing mention, a mental note, quickly forgotten… maybe it was mentioned in Jason&rsquo;s newsletter or some such.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not a totally off the wall idea. It&rsquo;s subtitled &lsquo;A Tribute to The Clash&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;ve had or listened to things like it before. I had something called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->London Booted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> once, which was sort of techno-ish covers of some or all of the tracks from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->London Calling<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And I remember listening to a reggae version of that album, or tracks from it, at least.</p>
<p>But this is every track on what is famously a triple album. Yes, including &lsquo;Career Opportunities&rsquo; (though not, to be fair, &lsquo;Blowing in the Guns of Brixton&rsquo;). And the great thing about it is, almost no track is a carbon copy of the original. We get jazz instrumentals, ska versions, rocked-up versions of ones The Clash took slowly, and everything in between. Most of the performers are little known, or unknown, to me at least. But we get Katrina of Katrina and the Waves, Jon Langford of the Mekons, Wreckless Eric, The Coal Porters, and of course the aforementioned former Scorcher.</p>
<p>It is really, really good. Highly recommended if you&rsquo;re a fan, and even if you&rsquo;re not, I imagine you&rsquo;ll find something to enjoy. Go on, <a href="https://album.link/i/256099883">find it on your favourite service here</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I love that the label it&rsquo;s on is called 00:02:59 Records. &lsquo;The band went in/And knocked them dead/In two minutes fifty-nine,&rsquo; as &lsquo;Hitsville UK&rsquo; says.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

			 <p>Spoilers below.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784971540">This</a>  is a really strange book. I know it&rsquo;s probably cultural differences in storytelling style, and what have you. But there is something deeply odd about the way this is told. I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on what it is (and at least part of it will be to do with the translation).</p>
<p>At a plot and character level, one thing that surprised me is that when someone starts seeing unexpected visual effects — specifically, a countdown timer superimposed on the world around them — they don&rsquo;t ever seem to think that the explanation is they&rsquo;re actually in a simulation. That would seem like the logical first attempt at an explanation, given the recent history of SF and indeed discussions outside of it.</p>
<p>We never learn what was meant to happen at the end of the countdown. And (not connected to that) the character we&rsquo;re first sympathetic to betrays all of humanity!</p>
<p>I liked the early parts about the Cultural Revolution in China. They linked surprisingly well into my <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/10/13/of-all-the.html">recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nineteen Eighty-Four<!-- raw HTML omitted --> deep dive</a>. Which is amusing because not long ago I read something about someone encouraging someone else to read this, where they said you just had to get past that part to really start enjoying it.</p>
<p>I did enjoy it, mind. I went right out and bought the sequels and have started <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Dark Forest<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I just find it weird. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://devilgate.org/2015/10/06/the-threebody-problem.html">actually a reread</a>, but it&rsquo;s nearly a decade since, and I only remembered two scenes.</p>

			 <h2 id="ministry-of-plenty">Ministry of Plenty</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2024. It&rsquo;s 40 years since 1984. So I guess that&rsquo;s why there have been a lot of things turning up that are related in one way or another to George Orwell&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nineteen Eighty-Four<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s considerably more than forty years since the novel was published: more like 75 years. Which is a memorable enough number in itself.</p>
<p>At Worldcon in Glasgow in August, the last panel I went to was about the book. People discussing when they had first read it, how it had affected them, the effects it had on literature and culture more broadly, and so on.</p>
<p>Then a few weeks later the podcast of the BBC Radio 4 programme <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In Our Time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dropped into my feed, with an episode about it. It was described as a &lsquo;summer repeat&rsquo;. I assume the programme is off the air but they like to keep the feed fed.  <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001bz77">It was originally broadcast in 2022</a>, so nothing to do with any anniversaries in this year, but no matter.</p>
<p>All of this served to remind me of two things: one, that it was high time I read it again. And two, since read it in my teenage years and never since, I had shamefully never quite read <em>all</em> of it. Because there&rsquo;s that bit in the middle where Winston is reading &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;, as it&rsquo;s called. And when you&rsquo;re fourteen or fifteen that can seem terribly dull and easily skippable.</p>
<p>Also at the convention<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I picked up a copy of Ken MacLeod&rsquo;s new collection, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Jura for Julia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  You might guess from the title that there&rsquo;s some sort of connection, what with Julia being the only female character in the original book, and Jura being where Orwell spent the last months of his life writing it.</p>
<p>And indeed, the collection is bookended by two connected stories comprising a sequel to Orwell&rsquo;s novel.</p>
<p>So I was going to revisit the original and then read Ken&rsquo;s stories. But I realised I didn&rsquo;t actually have a copy. I think I read it from the library all those years ago. We got our son a copy at some point, but that&rsquo;s either with him or in a box in the basement. So I decided just to buy a new one.</p>
<p>While I was in Foyles I noticed another connected work: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Julia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Sandra Newman. I remembered reading about this when it came out and thinking I&rsquo;d like to read it. It&rsquo;s a retelling of the story of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nineteen Eighty-Four<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, from Julia&rsquo;s point of view. It came out last year, so I&rsquo;m sure author and publisher had anniversaries in mind, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<h2 id="not-forever">Not Forever</h2>
<p>So what about these books, then?</p>
<p>There are two things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_geography_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four">Ingsoc</a> got right, I mention in passing: going over properly to the metric system — which leads to the oddity of a prole barman who has never even heard of a pint — and going to full use of the twenty-four-hour clock, giving us that famously startling opening line about the clocks striking thirteen.</p>
<p>Not much else, though. It&rsquo;s a bit odd thinking about it now that the ideology is called &lsquo;<em>English</em> Socialism&rsquo; when the geopolitical bloc Airstrip One is part of, Oceania, is clearly dominated by America. The renaming of the UK makes that clear. And indeed, the switch to decimal measurements and twenty-four-hour time are even stranger, given how America in our world is the biggest holdout against those.</p>
<p>I suppose the &lsquo;English&rsquo; in &lsquo;Ingsoc&rsquo; could mean the language. But a socialism dominated by America? Something that calls itself socialism, at least: it&rsquo;s no more socialism than Germany&rsquo;s &lsquo;National Socialism&rsquo; was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before that I dislike dystopian fiction as genre or background to stories. I wonder if that dislike was caused in part by early inoculation with this work.  But what I found really weird about reading it after all these years is how weirdly <em>cosy</em> it all felt. Maybe it&rsquo;s just because I knew what happens; maybe because there are these sequels by other hands to consider; or it could be somehow inherent in the writing. But I had no real sense of bleakness, nor even of menace. Strange, really.</p>
<p>It is, of course, a tragedy, among other things. Winston and Julia know that they&rsquo;ll be caught by the Thought Police and taken to the Ministry of Love eventually; but they believe that, whatever they have to go through, there will be a core of them, deep in their hearts, that will survive, uncorrupted, undefeated. I was reminded of Evey, in Alan Moore and David Lloyd&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->V for Vendetta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. About how you&rsquo;ll survive — maybe win — as long as they can never reach that last half inch of you (I write from probably inaccurate memory).</p>
<p>That turns out not to be true for Winston and Julia, as they each betray the other. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s assertion that &lsquo;We will empty you out and fill you up with us&rsquo; proves true; and the novel closes with Winston loving Big Brother. There is no hope. A boot stamping on a human face.</p>
<p>Except, then we get the appendix. It tells the story of Newspeak, and does so wholly in the past tense, describing plans the party had for the minimal, stripped-down language. How it was expected to limit the capability for thoughtcrime — for thought itself — in the populace forced to use it. But it is presented as if it were an academic work, part of a history of the Big Brother times in what was then called Airstrip One, and is now called Britain again.</p>
<p>Hope in an appendix. I like it.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-it-short">Keeping it Short</h2>
<p>So we come to the first sequel I want to speak of, which is composed of Ken MacLeod&rsquo;s two short stories. &lsquo;Nineteen Eighty-Nine&rsquo; picks up on Winston&rsquo;s story. He&rsquo;s taken from the Chestnut Tree café thinking he&rsquo;s finally going to be killed. But in fact it&rsquo;s the revolution. Big Brother and the party are overthrown. Winston is to be Minister of Truth in the new government.</p>
<p>And then in &lsquo;A Jura for Julia&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a decade or two later. Julia is a researcher in &lsquo;computational literature&rsquo;, mechanical writing. She used to be a mechanic who worked on the machines that created cheap novels for the proles. Now she&rsquo;s an academic studying the technology behind the machines. She travels to Jura because she has heard there is an important link there to the history of the machines. What she finds ties her story and Winston&rsquo;s together with Orwell&rsquo;s in a fascinating way.</p>
<h2 id="a-womans-perspective">A Woman&rsquo;s Perspective</h2>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Sandra Newman before <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Julia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but she&rsquo;s written several books, and been nominated for various awards. This one is authorised by Orwell&rsquo;s estate and tells the familiar story from Julia&rsquo;s perspective, expanding it both in worldbuilding, character, and time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a much richer story than Orwell&rsquo;s, in that Julia&rsquo;s character is dramatically expanded from the original, and we learn a great deal about the society, or the various societies that exist in Airstrip One. It&rsquo;s all well done, very convincing, and completely in keeping with the original. There&rsquo;s nothing added that couldn&rsquo;t have been imagined in Orwell&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Julia the character is not much more than a cipher in the original, and here she has a rich inner life, and is wonderfully and believably changeable.</p>
<p>One chapter opens with the line, &lsquo;She was in Love.&rsquo; Which jars you for a second, because the previous chapter ended with her and Winston&rsquo;s arrest. Till you remember that she refers to the ministries just by their key words: &lsquo;Truth&rsquo; for the Ministry of Truth, and so on.</p>
<p>It takes us to a an ending not so very different from MacLeod&rsquo;s but perhaps a more ambiguous one.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s enough <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nineteen Eighty-Four<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for a while, and enough 1984, too, though it strikes me that the novel I&rsquo;m writing at the moment is set then. It&rsquo;s a year that still has a massive gravitational pull on the imagination.</p>

			 <p>If there&rsquo;s a record for the longest gap between volumes of a series of collections, I think we all know that there&rsquo;s only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dangerous_Visions">one real contender</a>. Though to win it, JMS&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Last Dangerous Visions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will have to actually be released (which, at the time of writing, is scheduled to happen next month, amazingly).</p>
<p>Second on the list, though, might be <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781915556431">Nova Scotia</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The <a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/novascotiarev.htm">first volume</a> was published in 2005, to more-or-less coincide with the second Glasgow Worldcon. Nineteen years later all is well, as Volume 2 is published to more-or-less coincide with this year&rsquo;s Glasgow Worldcon.</p>
<p>And it is again, very good, and very varied. I&rsquo;m not going to go through the stories, but it struck me that three of them concern someone being resurrected — woken from cryogenic stasis, or reconstructed from DNA and memories — in a future that might not be quite what they had expected or hoped for. A couple of others include bringing back extinct species, or sentient life coming to entities that are not (to the best of our knowledge) sentient at present.</p>
<p>I doubt the stories were chosen deliberately to have those connections. Rather, perhaps this is how our current end-of-the-world fears are playing out: in fantasies of technological afterlives. Not that such stories are particularly new, but maybe they&rsquo;re particularly <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>Notable contributors: Ken McLeod, of course, Scotland&rsquo;s premier living SF author. James Kelman, surprisingly: as one of Scotland&rsquo;s best-known <em>literary</em> authors, it&rsquo;s pleasing that he&rsquo;d lower himself into our genre murk. Grant Morrison, Scotland&rsquo;s best known comics writer, I imagine. And plenty others.</p>

			 <p>I saw Tendai (as is his name) interviewed at Worldcon last month. Went along without knowing anything about him or his writing, and the interview was interesting enough that I went and bought <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529039481">this</a> in the dealers' room immediately afterwards. Or maybe the next day, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edinburgh Nights<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series, which I think is currently at three books with a fourth on the way and a fifth planned. Which means it kind of violates one of my personal guidelines to have bought it, but what the hell, you know?</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s set in an alternative Edinburgh where there&rsquo;s magic. The time is approximately the present day, because there&rsquo;s things like smartphones. But our heroine, Ropa, can talk to ghosts, which tend to hang about when they&rsquo;ve got unfinished business back on the plane of the living.</p>
<p>And a whole lot more happens besides. It&rsquo;s a pretty bleak environment that she lives in, essentially a shanty town of caravans on the edge of the city, very much hand to mouth. It feels kind of post-apocalypse, but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s been anything quite as disastrous as that, just a slow decline. Not sure, though, there are hints at things. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see where he takes it.</p>
<p>As far as the &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t start a series that the author hasn&rsquo;t finished writing&rsquo; guideline goes, it&rsquo;s pretty standalone, thought with plenty of setup for more.</p>

			 <p>I mentioned in the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/09/03/finished-reading-death.html">last books post</a> that I&rsquo;ve seen the Jackson Brodie TV series. Well, maybe not all of them. I enjoyed the latest book in the series so much that I thought I&rsquo;d go back and read the earlier ones. <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780385671316">This is the first</a>, and the story was completely unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>It was also surprisingly horrific. It starts by setting up three &lsquo;case histories&rsquo;, with three stories of crimes at different times in the past: a young girl disappears; a young woman is murdered; another young woman murders her husband.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re introduced to Jackson Brodie: divorced and trying to co-parent a young daughter and carry on his life, while also trying to run a private detective agency in Cambridge, a city he hates.</p>
<p>Somehow, all these cases are going to come together and get solved. As I said about the latest book, though, it&rsquo;s clear that Atkinson&rsquo;s writing about the minutiae of the human heart, far more than the minutiae of detective work. And that&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an enjoyable, easy read — well, apart from the gruesomeness and tension of the first three chapters — and intriguingly it ends as if Brodie&rsquo;s career is over. I don&rsquo;t know if she planned to write sequels, but clearly something must change.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve read several of Kate Atkinson&rsquo;s books, but never one of her Jackson Brodie detective series. This despite having seen the TV adaptations. So getting <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780385548007">this</a> as a birthday present was great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re promised a murder mystery set against the background of a country house hosting a murder-mystery party, and that&rsquo;s what we get, eventually. I really enjoyed it, but if anything I&rsquo;d like her to spend more time with the titular detective.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But we get various viewpoint characters, and really very little from Brodie&rsquo;s viewpoint. Very little actual detecting, too.</p>
<p>Indeed, I got the impression that Atkinson doesn&rsquo;t really <em>want</em> to be writing a detective story. Or she does, of course, but she&rsquo;s so keen on multiple viewpoints and character creation — and so good at them — that those are the things she&rsquo;s doing, more than writing a conventional story of a detective solving a mystery.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with that, of course, you can tell any story you want, any way you want, and why be bound by conventions?</p>

I assume that the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/08/16/finished-reading-against.html">third</a> volume just became so long that the publishers, and probably Donaldson himself, decided it needed to be split in two. Each of the third and <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780575108325">fourth</a> volumes is about the same length, anyway.</p>
<p>And they bring everything to a satisfying conclusion, that&rsquo;s the main thing. Of course Linden hesitates, and Covenant resists using wild magic (but not to the extent he once did). Of course Donaldson uses fifty words where fifteen would do. Of course his writerly tics come through.</p>
<p>But the pages keep turning, and old friends and enemies turn up, and Wild Magic, Law, and Earthpower do their things, and we all leave satisfied.</p>

			 <p>You will, I think, be far from surprised to learn that <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780356206523">this</a> is a reread. At least the third read, in fact. I suggested it as a possibility for my book club, and when it wasn&rsquo;t chosen I decided it was time anyway.</p>
<p>There are still books that should be in <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a> that I&rsquo;ve only read once: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stonemouth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Quarry<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But I&rsquo;ll get to those eventually.</p>
<p>One oddity about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Crow Road<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is that I&rsquo;ve never blogged about it before. Yet I&rsquo;ve loved it since I first read the opening line, at a convention in Glasgow in 1992, if memory serves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just read the opening line and you&rsquo;ll buy it,&rsquo; my friend Steve said, when I was hesitant about shelling out the huge £10 price for the hardback. I had already read all of Banks&rsquo;s earlier books, so I was definitely planning on getting it, but waiting for the paperback was the norm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was the day my grandmother exploded.&rsquo; Steve was right. I bought it, and all he subsequent books, in hardback.</p>
<p>Memory does serve, but not all that well: <a href="https://devilgate.org/2013/06/17/forgot-the-cry.html">I&rsquo;ve written all that before</a>, it turns out, after Banksie died. Though it remains slightly unclear which convention it was that year.</p>
<p>A book is more than its opening line, though. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Crow Road<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a family drama, set mostly in a fictional Scottish town not far from where I grew up. Also in Glasgow, a non-fictional city where the titular road exists. The metaphorical one is everywhere, of course: it means death, in the vernacular of that exploding grandmother.</p>
<p>I read it with more of a writerly eye this time, I think, and I wondered whether the structural games really add anything to the whole. I don&rsquo;t mean the parts that are effectively speculative: the main character, Prentice McHoan, trying to work out what might have happened to his missing uncle. Nor the flashbacks in third-person, when the main narrative is in first. That makes sense, as they&rsquo;re showing us Prentice&rsquo;s childhood, or things that happened to other family members when Prentice wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more thinking about a couple of flashes forward, that hint about where the main narrative is going to go. They aren&rsquo;t enough to really make the reader speculate, and they happen when we&rsquo;re already well into the story, so they aren&rsquo;t needed to make us keep going.</p>
<p>They  do no harm, though, and maybe Banksie needed to use them to keep his own interest up. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with them, or that.</p>
<p>I do find it hard to explain why this book is so compelling. I think it&rsquo;s probably his best non-SF book. It&rsquo;s probably not quite my favourite, though it&rsquo;s up there. I&rsquo;ve long thought it was partly cultural for me, in that the characters and locations feel like people and places I knew growing up. But that can&rsquo;t explain its broader appeal.</p>
<p>I guess Banksie was just a great writer.</p>

			 <p>I seem to have largely stopped blogging. Certainly, as a general election approaches, I&rsquo;ve written nothing publicly about politics.</p>
<p>Consider: in just over a week we could be rid of this appalling Tory government. The Labour one we get in its place (or, just possibly, a coalition) will probably not be much to write home about, but even if its policies are far from perfect, its plans to tax the rich and invest in the country&rsquo;s infrastructure far weaker than I&rsquo;d like: things can hardly be worse.</p>
<p>Indeed, they can only get better, right?</p>
<p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/01/18/i-joined-the.html">saw Keir Starmer speak at the Fabian Society</a> a few years back. 2020, surprisingly, but January, before the pandemic really got going. He came across there as a thoroughly good and decent, left-wing, progressive guy. I can&rsquo;t remember anything he said specifically, but it was positive, you know?</p>
<p>Now, he&rsquo;s generally seen as timid, scared of appearing to be too left-wing, that sort of thing, or worse. While at the same time seemingly fierce at purging the left of the party. And poor on women&rsquo;s rights, to say nothing of his dealings with women MPs and candidates.</p>
<p>Still, after the shitshow of the last few years, I&rsquo;ll accept competence, as long as it&rsquo;s not right-wing competence.</p>

The latest book-club book, and not the sort of thing I&rsquo;d choose normally.

			 <p>The latest bookclub book. Kincaid&rsquo;s brother died in 1996 of AIDS. Kincaid herself was estranged from her family for 20 years, so she saw her brother when he was three, and then again when he was 33, and dying.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529077094">this</a> is more about her than about him. She looks at feelings towards her birth family: does she love her brother? Does she love her mother? &lsquo;No&rsquo; is her conclusion for both. But she examines different kinds of love, different ways of loving.</p>
<p>Parts of it are kind of like cubist art in a way: examining the same place, person, or event, at different times, in the way the cubists would try to show a subject from different angles at the same time.</p>
<p>The writing flows very smoothly despite some impressively- if not excessively-long sentences.</p>

			 <p>I got <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781786897077">this</a> as a Christmas present from my beloved. I had no idea who Courttia Newland is. I assumed it was a woman, at first. It&rsquo;s not, and it turns out I had experienced some of his work already, as he wrote some of the scripts for Steve McQueen&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Small Axe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  series of films; specifically <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/01/26/lovers-rock.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lover&rsquo;s Rock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,</a>  <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/02/07/red-white-and.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Red, White and Blue<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> , and <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/03/06/education.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Education<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> . (I wouldn&rsquo;t bother clicking those links, it looks like I didn&rsquo;t write anything about them.)</p>
<p>I started the novel without reading any reviews or anything about it other than the blurb and quotes on the cover. The key one of those is this, from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Observer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A vast and wildly ambitious piece of speculative fiction that asks what the world would look like if slavery and colonialism never existed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which set me up with some expectations. Sensibly, Newland doesn&rsquo;t make this imagined world a utopia. Far from it, in fact. The world in which the protagonist, Markriss, finds himself, is pretty grim.</p>
<p>And to my mind, at least at first, the only thing in-universe that tells us about the absence of colonialism, etc, is skin colour is never mentioned. Yes, the world is different from our own, and it turns out (reading around the novel) a major reason is, instead of the weird monotheism of Judaeo-Christianity-Islam having the major religious impact on world history, African religions have the biggest influence.</p>
<p>What this means for our hero is he can have an out-of-body experience and it not exactly be unexpected.</p>
<p>Which takes us into the whole out-of-this-world part of this novel. All those blurbs talk about it as a novel of decolonisation and so on, which is fine. But that&rsquo;s because Newland has a mainstream, literary reputation — he has published several previous novels. <em>This</em>, though is a genre work. Science fiction, you might say, or fantasy, looked at from another direction.</p>
<p>And what nothing prepares you for (well, the reviews do, but I didn&rsquo;t want to read them first) is that this is a multiverse story. Because Markriss&rsquo;s ability to leave his body in his astral form develops to the point where he can do so permanently; and then drop back down into a different tributary of the titular river.</p>
<p>This puts him in an alternative version of himself: another timeline. Some have very similar events and experiences; some are very different, such as one that doesn&rsquo;t look at all removed from our own. He always has some of the people closest to him, though their relationships vary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s effective and accomplished, but it can be unsatisfying. Because, when he leaves a timeline, he leaves its story incomplete. We don&rsquo;t know what happened to the first version of Markriss, or the second, or…</p>
<p>Sometimes the language, the linguistic style, can be confusing. But it feels like a positive sort of confusion, the kind that stretches your mind.</p>
<p>On the whole, I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read several of Keenan&rsquo;s books before, and enjoyed them, but found them strange. This one is composed of three or four different narratives. They&rsquo;re interlinked, or at least interconnected, but they&rsquo;re very different.</p>
<p>A love story in France of a few years ago about someone who is studying cathedrals (sort of); a historical story about the Siege of Khartoum; a far-future science-fiction story supposedly written by two of the characters in one of the other sections.</p>
<p>And so on. It will bear rereading, I imagine, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll dedicate the time. I started it just before Christmas and finished it this morning. With a few other books in between, but still.</p>

			 <p>I didn&rsquo;t know I was writing a trilogy, but here we are.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://devilgate.org/2024/02/24/well-this-is.html">finding the mysterious pasta shape last weekend</a>, having <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/01/04/a-pasta-mystery.html">learned about it in early 2021</a> from <a href="https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/12/2020-bucatini-shortage-investigation.html">an article by Rachel Handler</a> in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Magazine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we finally tried it last night.</p>
<p>Rachel believes bucatini is &lsquo;the only noodle worth eating; all other dry pastas might as well be firewood.&rsquo; And she describes it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>spaghetti but thicker and with a hole in it, meaning it absorbs 200 percent more sauce than its thinner, hole-free brethren, due to math.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rereading the article now, I had forgotten that she did a whole investigation about the shortage, writing it as if it were about a grave conspiracy, and hoping she might be called &lsquo;the Bernstein of Bucatini&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So what of it?</p>
<p>It was… fine, I guess? Like spaghetti, but thicker.</p>
<p>But I fear we might not be getting the real thing. From the photograph accompanying the article, the hole through the noodles looks quite substantial. Whereas in the packet we have — the brand being Tesco Finest — the hole is quite narrow. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York<!-- raw HTML omitted --> photo might be exaggerating the holiness, but I suspect we&rsquo;re being fobbed off over here, with fakeatini.</p>
<p>Certainly there&rsquo;s no way it collected three times the sauce that standard spaghetti does.</p>
<p>Of course, if you go back to my picture from the other day you&rsquo;ll see that the packet describes it as &lsquo;<strong>Spaghetti</strong>&rsquo; in big letters, with &lsquo;bucatini&rsquo; underneath, in much smaller type, like a subtitle.</p>
<p>Maybe, rather than a fake, we have a hybrid.</p>

			 <p>First, a disclaimer: the author of <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781787612747">this book</a> was on the same Creative Writing MA as me, and I read a prerelease PDF that she sent me.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s a really good young-adult fantasy story set in the real world, present day.</p>
<p>Or I think &lsquo;middle grade&rsquo; is the sort of level it&rsquo;s marketed towards. The main character, Saffi, is about 12. Her younger brother is maybe eight or ten. Their mum has died tragically young and their dad takes them from London to live with their grandparents in a B&amp;B by the sea in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>The titular house has been in the family for generations, and it has A History. The kids hate it at first, but Saffi tries to adjust and to keep her brother&rsquo;s spirits up. She is helped by a slightly mysterious local boy they meet.</p>
<p>And then a group of guests arrive at the B&amp;B. In the middle of the night. Without coming through the door.</p>
<p>Things get stranger after that. Will Saffi and Milo save the family&rsquo;s legacy, themselves, and their new friend&rsquo;s home, from the plans of these powerful figures out of myth and fairytale? Only by reading will you find out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great. Get it for your kids.</p>

<p>We watched this on BFI Player, where its English title was the direct translation of the French one: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Girlfriend&rsquo;s Boyfriend<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But Letterboxd knows it as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Boyfriends and Girlfriends<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The French title is both better and more accurate, and the potentially-ambiguous meaning of &lsquo;<em>amie</em>&rsquo; is matched by that of &lsquo;girlfriend&rsquo; when used by women.</p>

			 <p>In <a href="https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/02/03/ten-blue-links-for-3rd-feb-2024/#1a79a958-71e8-46b9-a4fa-d6519eae97f6">the lone footnote of his latest post</a>, Ian Betteridge bemoans the use of the term &lsquo;users&rsquo; for people making use of software:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve always hated calling people users rather than customers. You owe “users” nothing. You owe your customers everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember seeing this complaint years ago. &lsquo;Why do we refer to people with a term that comes from the illegal drugs trade?&rsquo; was a common refrain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, people taking illegal drugs <em>are</em> sometimes referred to as &lsquo;users&rsquo;. But only really in 70s cop shows. I grew up on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Starsky &amp; Hutch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kojak<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as much as the next guy my age, but I don&rsquo;t look to them for appropriate linguistic terms today.</p>
<p>More to the point, the term &lsquo;user&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t <em>come</em> from the drug trade, it <em>went to</em> it. The term just comes from the English language: from the verb &lsquo;to use&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Anyone who uses any item is a &lsquo;user&rsquo; of that item. If I cut a slice of bread, I&rsquo;m a user of the bread knife. If I go into the garden to gather the still-uncollected autumn leaves, I&rsquo;m a user of the rake. And so on.</p>
<p>Ian prefers the term &lsquo;customer&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s fair enough if you bought the item in question. But he also writes about using <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, which is a piece of software that is available at no cost. I use it every day, but I&rsquo;m not a customer of the people who make it. Ian may pay them, as it&rsquo;s possible to do for certain features, or just to support them. But there are plenty of examples of software for which that is not the case. It&rsquo;s just free. You&rsquo;re not a customer of Linus Torvalds when you use Linux, for example.</p>
<p>Anyway, my feelings are almost the opposite: being a <em>user</em> — or a <em>reader</em> or a <em>listener</em> or <em>viewer</em>, for that matter — is the truth, is the state that has power, has meaning. Not the tawdry commercial act, the mere fact of when or whether we bought a thing.</p>

<p>If Apple needed a general-purpose language for configuration, why did they invent their own, rather than using Terraform, say?</p>
<p>But then, this Pkl (‘Pickle’) seems a lot more expressive than Terraform, and a lot more down-to-Earth and less cloudy.</p>

			 <p>I can see why <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781324064831">this</a> won the Booker <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last year<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the year before last. It&rsquo;s beautifully written, with a kind of light, easy style. And yet it goes to some very, very dark places.</p>
<p>The titular Maali is dead at the start, finds himself in the afterlife, and doesn&rsquo;t know how he died. He&rsquo;s given seven days — the &lsquo;moons&rsquo; of the title — to find out, or not, before he has to decide whether or not to go into &lsquo;The Light&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There are ghosts, ghouls, demons, and horrors. Most of the latter two are living humans, because we&rsquo;re in Sri Lanka&rsquo;s civil war, and Maali was a photographer who photographed the horrors. Many of the dead he meets died in atrocities, and they&rsquo;re not shy about sharing their stories.</p>
<p>I can highly recommend this, but not if you&rsquo;ll be too disturbed by stories of atrocities. So think of this as a content warning.</p>

			 <p>Back in 2021, when I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/03/30/how-to-write.html">read Chee&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How to Write an Autobiographical Novel<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>, I expressed an interest in this book, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edinburgh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, largely because of its title. As I said then, &lsquo;the Edinburgh connection in the novel didn’t survive the writing and editing process, but he kept the title anyway.&rsquo; There is, in fact, a tangential character in this who has a loose connection to the city, but it&rsquo;s not relevant.</p>
<p>What we have is a <em>bildungsroman</em>, the story of a boy becoming a man, knowing he&rsquo;s gay from an early age, and going through various experiences both because of that fact and having nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>But about halfway through, the first-person narrative switches to a different character&rsquo;s first-person narrative, which caused me some confusion. The sections are headed with the name of the narrator, but since there is only this one change, then a change back for the last quarter, it wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious what was going on.</p>
<p>That was OK though. What I didn&rsquo;t enjoy so much was a kind of allusiveness that really became vagueness, which at times made it slightly hard to see what he was getting at. Especially in the last quarter.</p>
<p>And that last quarter is the most difficult and problematic part of the whole. See, early on, the first narrator is abused, along with several classmates, by a teacher. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much effect on the narrator, though it does on some of the other victims.</p>
<p>But in the end the main narrator becomes an abuser himself; of the other narrator, who is linked to the whole story in a way that is, frankly, too coincidental. And it all ends in a kind of unresolved ambiguity which I found left a bad taste.</p>
<p>All in all, I preferred his nonfiction.</p>

			 <p>The first Christmas-present book, finished on boxing day.  Short, and a page-turner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read an Agatha Christie before, perhaps surprisingly. I&rsquo;m not even sure I&rsquo;ve seen any significant adaptation, except I once caught the end of one. Of this novel, unfortunately. So I sort of knew what the conclusion was, which meant I was seeing how the clues pointed in that direction.</p>
<p>No matter, it&rsquo;s still a great read, and makes me want to read more.</p>

			 <p>I suppose I should tell you what I thought of the three <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 60th anniversary specials.</p>
<p>They were good. Not great, but good. My favourite of the three — and I think probably the best, too — was the middle one, &lsquo;Wild Blue Yonder&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As to the ending, the &lsquo;bi-generation&rsquo; thing was daft, but fun. It was good to give the leaving and arriving Doctors the chance to interact, and a Doctor ending without it being a death was good.</p>
<p>However, let us speak of the extension of that effect, as explained in <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/doctor-who-bigeneration-doctorverse-newsupdate/">this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Radio Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article</a>. I was directed there by <a href="https://micro.blog/BenSouthwood">@BenSouthwood</a>, via a <a href="https://bensouthwood.me/2023/12/09/doctor-who-was.html">conversation on Micro.blog</a>.</p>
<p>As I said there, I loved the idea of the Timeless Child, and the expansion it brought to The Doctor&rsquo;s past and the prehistory of the Time Lords. But this &lsquo;every Doctor is now bi-generated&rsquo; idea just seems like it leaves things in a mess.</p>
<p>Sure, you can explain it all away with branching timelines, alternative realities and all that. But it all just seems a bit too chaotic, you know? Even if they never use it, it feels unnecessary.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this idea of making an expanded &lsquo;Whoniverse&rsquo;, in the vein of what Marvel and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have become. Disney&rsquo;s money is going to allow this, presumably. More shows, even, than when we had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Torchwood<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sarah Jane Adventures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Trouble is, from my point of view, that I&rsquo;ve lost interest in both <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Marvel exactly because there&rsquo;s <em>so much stuff</em>. It&rsquo;s all just too much.</p>
<p>So I hope my favourite programme doesn&rsquo;t go the same way. Or at least, if it does, that the original programme will always remain at the hearts of the franchise, and not depend on any of the expansion packs.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had this book for years, and I thought I had read it. Took a look at it a week or two back and realised I hadn&rsquo;t. So I did.</p>
<p>What I also didn&rsquo;t realise was that it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://christopher-priest.co.uk/books/the-dream-archipelago">Dream Archipelago</a> story. Which is surprising, since it starts in present-day (1980s) London. In fact it&rsquo;s the <a href="https://christopher-priest.co.uk/books/the-affirmation">first novel</a> (though not, I think, the first story) to use the Dream Archipelago as a setting, or state of mind.</p>
<p>Peter Sinclair suffers various crises in his personal life, and decides to write an autobiography to better understand himself. Through various revisions his writing becomes more fictionalised, until he&rsquo;s writing about the islands. Or living in them. Is it alternative world or madness? Portal fantasy or mental breakdown?</p>
<p>Or maybe both, or neither. You could argue that as a story it doesn&rsquo;t entirely make sense, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d go there. I mean, I&rsquo;d go <em>there</em>, to the Archipelago, for sure (it feels a lot like Greece to me, and indeed Sinclair and his ex/not-ex girlfriend met there, we are told).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a novel that leaves you questioning its realities, and maybe your own. And that seems like a good thing to me.</p>

			 <p>In a way it was surprising that Shane MacGowan survived this long, considering his noted and dramatic habits. But it&rsquo;s still sad that he&rsquo;s died.</p>
<p>I count The Pogues as one of the bands I&rsquo;ve seen live most of all. The only other one that comes close would be The Fall, and either could be the winner. Goes back to 1985, either way.</p>
<p>The Pogues were vey much a band of supremely talented musicians and songwriters. But Shane was the driving force. What they did was to meld punk with Irish folk music. The former, of course had helped me through my adolescent years and would remain a lifelong love. The latter: well, I came from a Scottish Catholic background, so it was pretty familiar, between Scottish folk and Irish songs sung at Celtic matches.</p>
<p>So on the instant that I first heard them — certainly on Peel, and probably &lsquo;Sally MacLennane&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d say — they clicked. There was no learning curve, no adjustment to this new sound. It was just <em>there</em>, it belonged, as if it had always existed.</p>
<p>The Pogues may have been inevitable, but Shane was a genius. And his songs, as I <a href="https://devilgate.micro.blog/2014/03/13/some-people-left.html">wrote when Phil Chevron died</a> were steeped in death imagery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with a couple of excellent screen grabs from Twitter (where, just to note, as I write, &lsquo;Sodomy and the Lash&rsquo; is trending under a &lsquo;food&rsquo; heading, which is just beyond weird.</p>

			 <p>Why did nobody ever tell me that this book is funny? I had it in my head as a slightly worthy, if much-loved, courtroom drama. But the trial is only part of it, and quite small part at that. Though its ramifications play out to the end, and echo back to near the start.</p>
<p>Scout is an endearing narrator, wise beyond her years, tough, smart. Lee conjures a believable, well-formed picture of life in small-town Alabama in the thirties. A place of community and friendship, gossip and criticism, poverty and hard work. And a few people, notably Atticus, of course, willing to do the right thing in the face of dangerous racist neighbours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s intriguing, from a writer&rsquo;s perspective, how the narrative voice changes in the courtroom scenes when they do come.</p>
<p>And Boo Radley gave the band their name. I don&rsquo;t think I knew that, or if I did I&rsquo;d forgotten.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need me to tell you it&rsquo;s a classic, and it turns out, for good reason.</p>

			 <p>There is no evidence in the text of this book that it is SF. Yet here I have a copy, published in the SF Masterworks series.</p>
<p>Graham Sleight addresses this in his introduction, but doesn&rsquo;t try to give a conclusive reading either. There is no definitive answer, as the work is deliberately ambiguous.</p>
<p>The titular Sarah is a woman described as ‘ugly’ who turns up in the camp of some Chinese men who are working on railroads in the USA of the 1870s. She speaks no known human language, though she does make sounds. She gains her name later because, a character says, ‘she sings like an angel’. One of the men, a young man called Chin, is volunteered to try to find where she belongs, or failing that, at least get rid of her, so she stops distracting them.</p>
<p>So begins a trek across the Pacific Northwest and beyond. Along the ways we meet various characters with various good and bad qualities.</p>
<p>The ending is, as I say, ambiguous. We never find out who or what Sarah Canary is. But the journey is quite enjoyable.</p>

			 <p>I picked this up because of the title, taken as it obviously is from an early song by <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/the-clash/">my favourite band</a>. I bought it because it is set in and around the famous anti-Nazi festival in Victoria Park in London. Or at least it starts there.</p>
<p>Though that&rsquo;s not quite true. It starts even closer to home for me: my kids' primary school is mentioned early on, and many other streets, pubs, takeaways and landmarks that still exist are visited.</p>
<p>Joe Thomas was born in 1977, so he&rsquo;s doing this from research, not memory, but it captures the area very well, and the time — well, from what I know of those times in London, I think he&rsquo;s done a great job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not mainly about the music scene, though. Thomas is a crime writer, and this is, kind of, a crime novel. And becomes more so as it goes on, and jumps to 1983. As you might imagine, given the notoriety of Stoke Newington Police Station of the time, it&rsquo;s about bent coppers. And one more-or-less decent cop who is — we think — trying to bring them down.</p>
<p>I say &lsquo;We think&rsquo;, because it&rsquo;s not finished. It turns out it&rsquo;s the start of a trilogy, with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Red Menace<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->True Blue<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to follow. This one was only published this year, so I guess it&rsquo;ll be a while before we see the followups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all pretty good. It uses a slightly odd, cut-up sort of style: half sentences, fragments ending in dashes. But it&rsquo;s very readable. As I say, I was drawn to it by the music and the locations, but I enjoyed spending time with the characters, and the situation is compelling. Real life events are stitched into fictional ones (or vice-versa).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, then, it&rsquo;s a very political book. And surprisingly Thatcher turns up as a character. I&rsquo;m not sure why Thomas choose to do that. Maybe since most of the characters are on the left, it was to provide some sort of balance. Why not go as far up and right as possible, I suppose. I don&rsquo;t mean Thatcher is the furthest-right person in it, to be fair: the National Front are heavily involved, too.</p>
<p>The main police character is running &lsquo;spycops&rsquo;, and has operatives inside both the NF and the loose coalition of groups that oppose them (the Anti-Nazi League, Rock Against Racism, the Socialist Workers' Party). I expect as the series goes on we&rsquo;ll see some version of the scandals around that whole business, too.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s slightly surprising, perhaps, that I&rsquo;ve never seen this horror
classic, given my sometime, occasional, interest in the genre. But then,
it wasn&rsquo;t available or was hard to get in the UK for the core years
when I might have seen it.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s on iPlayer just now, so I rectified the situation.</p>
<p>Except I almost didn&rsquo;t get past the first ten minutes. Honestly, I was
so bored with the slow, tedious Iraq-set grave-robbing scene  <em>that has
nothing to do with the rest of the story!</em></p>
<p>And the film as a whole is weirdly fragmentary, disjointed after that,
at least for the first half.</p>
<p>Then the last third is just one big advert for the Catholic church.
Though I would note that the exorcism fails, the old exorcist is killed
offscreen (and weirdly, he turns out to be the archaeologist/grave
robber from the start).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the self-sacrifice of the doubting Jesuit Father Karras, that gets
the demon out of the girl. His ending is one of the bravest things I&rsquo;ve
ever seen in a film. And those steps were the scariest thing in this
film.</p>
<p>Presumably the necklace/coin-like artefact that somehow made its way
from Iraq was supposed to have had something to do with allowing the
demon into the girl, but no use or sense of that was made in the story.</p>
<p>Decent effects. good makeup, and a great performance from Linda Blair
(if slightly wooden performances from most of the rest of the cast)
leave this as just OK, and far from the classic of its repute.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, of course.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not Nolan&rsquo;s best, and I&rsquo;m not sure it entirely makes sense. But it was better, and easier to understand, than I&rsquo;d been led to believe. Of course, I was watching it at home, with subtitles on, so that always helps with making out mumblecore actors.</p>
<p>But the time-flipping: I realise it&rsquo;s well thought-out, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s quite well thought out <em>enough</em>. A second watch might give me clarity on that, but unlike say <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interstellar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inception<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d particularly want to watch this again any time soon.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780606192064">This</a> isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing I&rsquo;d normally think of reading, but I&rsquo;ve joined a book club at work, and this was the latest book.  <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/08/14/the-city-the.html">The China Míeville I read recently</a> was the first.</p>
<p>This one is a historical novel based on the true story of the Mirabal sisters, three women from the Dominican Republic who were assassinated for political activism by the regime of the dictator Trujillo, in 1960. Among the history of Latin American dictatorships, that was one I had never heard of.</p>
<p>A fictionalised story, bringing the characters to the fore. There&rsquo;s relatively little about what they actually did regarding revolutionary activities, but lots about them as daughters, as mothers. It&rsquo;s told from four points of view: each of the murdered sisters, Patria, Minerva, and Mate; and that of their surviving sister, Dedé.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautifully written novel, heartbreaking because you know how it&rsquo;s going to end, and because the characters are so well-realised, so brought to life.</p>
<p>The day they were murdered, the 25th of November 1960, is memorialised by the UN as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_for_the_Elimination_of_Violence_against_Women">International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women</a>.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s only a few days since I finished — just over a week since the year-long wait was over — and it seems like ages. Now we&rsquo;re back into another wait — hopefully not more than a year — till we find out what&rsquo;s next for Strike and Robin.</p>
<p>Here, Robin has to go undercover to investigate a cult. By which I mean, she has to sign up as if she were a believer, and go deep, deep undercover. It gets very tense.</p>
<p>Minor spoilers follow.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t enjoy this as much as the previous one or two, I think. Certainly at first I was a bit disappointed because of the time-jump. We&rsquo;re eight months after the end of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Ink Black Heart<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, when I had expected it to continue straight on, the way <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Troubled Blood<!-- raw HTML omitted --> flowed right into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IBH<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But I think the main problem was that the two main characters are separated for much of it, precisely because she&rsquo;s undercover, so can&rsquo;t really communicate with him.</p>
<p>Of course, once it all kicked into gear, the pages kept turning like they always do. But, while it was great to see them bring down an appalling cult, it just wasn&rsquo;t as emotionally resonant for me as, especially, the previous two.</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;ve heard comments about this over the years, but I can&rsquo;t
remember whether people say it's surprisingly good, or so bad it's
good.</p>
<p>It's somewhere in between, of course. It's very much of its time,
which was 1995 — the same year as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Matrix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, if I&rsquo;m remembering
correctly. And while it comes from a place not that far from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The
Matrix<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — it&rsquo;s about hackers and how our lives are tied up with
computer systems, after all — it&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>Not least because it&rsquo;s far more a realist piece, compared to the
SF/fantasy stylings of the Wachowskis' film. Here, Sandra Bullock is a
freelance computer expert of loosely defined skills, who gets caught in
the backwash from the corruption of a sometime client&rsquo;s security
software.</p>
<p>Something like that, anyway. It starts very slowly, despite a dramatic
prelude incident, but she&rsquo;s soon on the run, wooed and threatened by a
glamorous hacker/gangster.</p>
<p>Out on her own with no one she can trust, she has to trust herself.</p>
<p>It's not bad. Probably not so-bad-it&rsquo;s-good, either. Just OK.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve always considered this the least of Iain Banks&rsquo;s novels. As, I think, did he. If I remember correctly, this was the one about which he said he wrote it without a plan, and he&rsquo;d never do that again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s strange, coming back to <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a>, and reading this for the first time in many years, to find that I liked it far more than I expected to. (Funny to note that my only other reference to it here was <a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/01/25/a-song-of.html">saying it was better than I remembered</a>.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that bad at all. It doesn&rsquo;t meander the way you might expect the &lsquo;no plan&rsquo; thing to imply. What is striking is how apt the title is. A significant proportion of the narrative is taken up with the main character&rsquo;s dreams. All of which either illuminate her past or tie in to other events in the plot, so they make sense.</p>
<p>But whichever novelist it was that I remember saying, &lsquo;Never have a dream sequence&rsquo; — Chris Priest, I think — must hate it.</p>

<p>The 1954 version of <em>A Star is Born</em> has in it the bones of a great film. It is not, however, the great film it&rsquo;s reputed to be.</p>
<p>I should start by noting that our enjoyment of this was marred by the fact that the sound was out of sync. We rented it from Apple TV on our Roku box, and it was out from the start. I tried all the suggestions I could find online to fix it, short of a factory reset. Thing is, all of those were about the sound being out of sync <em>on the Roku</em>.</p>
<p>But the Roku was fine, in every other app, and in other things in the Apple TV app (great to have <em>The Morning Show</em> back). No, the problem here was that particular file, it seemed like.</p>
<p>Maybe there was a way we could have forced a redownload of it, and got a different version. If so, it wasn&rsquo;t to be found.</p>
<p>But you adjust, you put up with things. We were startled half an hour or so in (to a <em>three hour film</em>, I note) when the video stopped and was replaced with a sepia-toned still image. Clearly a production still. The audio, and the story, carried on. The picture changed to another still. Visuals came back, to a long shot. Then another still.</p>
<p>This was strange enough that it deserved duckducking. Turns out we were seeing the result of studio meddling. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/oqnc5i/a_star_is_born_1954_does_an_uncut_print_exist/">It seems a producer, believing it was too long, made the decision to cut it</a>.
Without the director.</p>
<p>And later the studio, in a BBC-<em>Doctor Who</em>-video-wiping level of stupidity, melted the offcuts down to reclaim the silver.</p>
<p>Thing is, the producer may have been wrong at the time &mdash; according to that story, the shortened version was less popular &mdash; and he was certainly wrong in <em>what</em> he cut; but he wasn&rsquo;t wrong about the film being overlong.</p>
<p>That may be unfair. <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/01/01/rrr.html">Three-hour films can work perfectly well</a>, after
all. No, the edits should have been made at the script stage.</p>
<p>Or maybe at directing.Because this film is incoherent at times. A sudden cut and it&rsquo;s months or years later with no sense of what went on in between. That can be fine, it can work well. Except here it felt
like they had a series of scenes that they wanted to show, and they just bashed them together without a thought for how the story would flow.</p>
<p>There are some great moments. Judy Garland has a fantastic voice, of course, and is a perfectly fine actor, and a very good <em>physical</em> actor, it turns out.</p>
<p>A great voice, rubbish songs, unfortunately. Getting her to sing a song that includes the word &lsquo;somewhere&rsquo; does not make it as good as the song she&rsquo;s most famous for.</p>
<p>Honestly, that and the song-within-a-film-within-the-film (&lsquo;Born in a Trunk&rsquo;, I think it was called) are as much as I remember about the music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of keen to see if the seventies or twenty-tens versions are better. I&rsquo;ve got to imagine they must be.</p>
<p>Shorter, anyway</p>

<p>But I enjoyed it nonetheless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite glad, though, I don&rsquo;t have the other books yet. I feel it&rsquo;s best to take a break after a story like this. Let it sink in. Prepare yourself, maybe, for the next one.</p>
<p>Anyway, more of the same: The Land is in danger, Linden Avery&rsquo;s son is in Lord Foul&rsquo;s clutches, and she&rsquo;s prepared to do just about anything to save it, and him. But especially him. I expect we&rsquo;re going to see a situation where she puts the whole Land — the whole of Earth, indeed — in danger, by trying to save Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Maybe she already has.</p>
<p>Oh: people have <em>far too many different names</em> in this. I mean, names by which various people refer to them. In the very last chapter someone refers to &lsquo;The Timewarden&rsquo;. I was like, &lsquo;That sounds like The Doctor; what the hell is going on?&rsquo; But they just meant Thomas Covenant.</p>

			 <p>Normally speaking I&rsquo;d claim <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141920078">a novel written in the 1930s and set in the late 40s</a> for science fiction. But this doesn&rsquo;t quite reach the threshold. There are around three obvious things that are futuristic: a reference to the Anglo-Nicaraguan war of 1946; &lsquo;air mail&rsquo;,  where a package sent from London is dropped into a field in Sussex; and the astonishing combination of phone and television, allowing the callers to see as well as hear each other! Or rather, one caller to see the other, since phone boxes don&rsquo;t have &lsquo;television dials&rsquo; (but must at least have cameras).</p>
<p>Oh, and the train service has become rubbish, not because of the car or Beeching, but because (wealthy) people mostly fly.</p>
<p>But all that is nothing compared to how funny and overall good this novel is. Stella Gibbons wrote many other novels, but all of them are out of print but this, which is a great shame.</p>

			 <p>I started reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473619777">this</a> a few years back, and stopped after the first chapter or so, because it seemed too similar to the thing I was trying to write at the time. I didn&rsquo;t want to be overly influenced, or worse, unconsciously plagiarise it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s always been in the back of my mind. And recently I&rsquo;ve been trying to get back into that novel I was working on then, and finding it difficult. So I thought maybe reading the space opera I backed away from because it was too similar to my own nascent space opera would be just what I needed to get me kickstarted.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t quite happened yet (maybe because I read it on holiday), but I loved the hell out of this.</p>
<p>Great characters you enjoy spending time with. A plot that&rsquo;s just believable enough, with stakes that are high for the characters and then get higher. An interesting, believable galactic political background, with Earth as very much the minor player.</p>
<p>None of the nonhuman characters feel really <em>alien</em>, except from in their physical descriptions, but that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to read <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781408871775">this</a> since I read a review of it back when it came out, in 2017. So, six years on, I finally did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly slight, given all the fuss and praise. I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with Saunders before reading that review, but he is famous for his short stories. I&rsquo;ve read a few of those since — at least one during <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">my MA</a> — and they&rsquo;re  fine, but to my mind tend to suffer from the problem that many short stories have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/short-stories/">mentioned this here before</a>, though seemingly only once. Often, when I read a short story — even, or perhaps especially, by one of the supposed greats of of the form: Carver, Hemingway, even Chekhov — I&rsquo;m left thinking, &lsquo;So what? What was the point of writing that, and why did you leave it where you did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, I recognise the skill that it takes to conjure a life, a character, in few words. And Saunders makes good use of that ability here. Because the story is not very much about Abraham Lincoln. It&rsquo;s not even that much about his son, Willie, who is the one who is actually in the &lsquo;bardo&rsquo;, a place where souls wait after death in some schools of Buddhism. Rather, it&rsquo;s about some of the other souls that are trapped in the same Washington graveyard. We get a whole host of compressed backstories.</p>
<p>And we get altogether too many quotes from books and articles about Lincoln and the death of his son. I haven&rsquo;t investigated to see whether these are from actual Lincoln biographies, histories of the American Civil War, and so on, or they are cleverly invented by Saunders. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_in_the_Bardo">This Wikipedia article suggests it&rsquo;s a mixture</a>.) But I found them much less interesting than the stories of the dead souls. A few would have been fine, for background, but it feels like they make up about half the book.</p>
<p>More stories about the dead, please.</p>

			 <p>Forty years ago it was: towards the end of school, Watty — <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/02/12/pennyfarthings-and-paranoia.html">he of the Number 6 badge, celebrating <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Prisoner<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> — turned me on to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does he not believe in?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everything!&rsquo; said Watty with relish.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get into the first book. There was an early section where I ground to a halt. But I went back to it, and ripped through the five books of the two trilogies that were out yet.</p>
<p>Then I had to wait. This is largely why I try not to start a series before its author has finished writing it. Those weeks and months through the first year of uni were interminable. (Only in that one regard, though, to be fair.)</p>
<p>There was a guy on my corridor in the halls of residence who was similarly waiting, and when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->White Gold Wielder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came out, he bought it at once.</p>
<p>In hardback. I was shocked by the profligacy, and didn&rsquo;t emulate him. Besides, it wouldn&rsquo;t have matched my paperbacks.</p>
<p>But after he&rsquo;d read it, he lent it to me. I wish I could remember his name.</p>
<p>So it should be clear that I liked the books a lot. However, I was thereafter corrupted by the general consensus that these were not well-written books, not a good example of the genre.</p>
<p>And yes, sure, they&rsquo;re not particularly well-written. Donaldson can be over-wordy and repetitive at times. But he knew how to weave a tale that gripped me.</p>
<p>And now, forty years hence, after my son had borrowed my old copies and read them (including my paperback of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->White Gold Wielder<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I bought to complete  the set, but have never read, since I never reread the series) he discovered (something which I vaguely knew) that Donaldson had written a &lsquo;final&rsquo; trilogy. Which has since turned into a tetralogy. I don&rsquo;t know when that happened. This volume that I read — my son&rsquo;s — says it&rsquo;s three volumes.</p>
<p>So how is it? Pretty damn good, actually. A copious &lsquo;What Has Gone Before&rsquo; leads off, and reminds me how much I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> remember about the original six books. And then — well, I don&rsquo;t want to get into spoilers, but after the first hundred or so pages, it&rsquo;s a real page-turner for the next four hundred or so, and leaves me keen to know how it all ends.</p>
<p>So expect more of this stuff here, in due course. This time, it&rsquo;s all finished, and there will be no need for me to wait for a final volume.</p>

			 <p>It’s like China wanted to write a police procedural, a detective story. But being China, there was no way it could be set in the quotidian world of today.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780330534192">Which is great.</a>. The setup here is that there are two cities, Besźel an Ul Qoma, somewhere in Eastern Europe; but they both occupy the same space. People in on can’t interact with those in the other.</p>
<p>That’s about as much as I knew about it before I started.</p>
<p>In another way it feels it&rsquo;s kind of an extended metaphor for how we don&rsquo;t notice things that are right under our noses. Or, as my beloved said, just for how we can live in a city like London alongside people from other cultures, people who look and dress differently, who even move differently; and never interact with them</p>
<p>This is both good and bad, of course. Or can be both or either depending on the circumstances. Because we&rsquo;re ignoring other people, whole swathes of them. The live their lives, full, rich, desperate, happy, sad; and we know nothing of them. They know nothing of us. Yet we don&rsquo;t get in their way. We don&rsquo;t interfere with them. We let them get on with their lives, and they us with ours, not causing them problems, as they cause us none.</p>
<p>Or only the most minor of inconveniences as we avoid each other on the street.</p>
<p>But is there even a <em>third</em> city, co-terminal with the two we know about? Some believe there is. Does Orciny exist?</p>
<p>You’ll have to read it to find out.</p>

			 <p>To tide me over until the new Strike book comes out (in just under two months) I suddenly decided to reread JK&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781408704202">single non-pseudonymous, non-magical book</a>.  It&rsquo;s over a decade old now, which is kind of hard to believe.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a slice of small-town England, in which a parish council member dies, leaving the titular vacancy. And all that proceeds from that. It shouldn&rsquo;t be as compelling as it is, based on that description. But there you go.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/05/29/films-books-blogging.html">mentioned in May</a>, that I had been reading this. It&rsquo;s taken me till now to finish it.</p>
<p>In another sense it&rsquo;s taken me a lot longer: I first started reading it in 2004. Back then I was <a href="https://devilgate.org/2005/10/20/postexam-comedown.html">doing an Open University literature course</a>. In one module an extract from <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780140434279">Daniel Deronda</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> was one of the options for us to write about. I think I must have chosen it, because my tutor sung its praises, saying it was a great one to read over Christmas, &lsquo;curled up next to the fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So I bought it and started it at the time. I can be fairly sure of this, as the bookmarks I found in it, when I picked it up back in May, were a pair of old-school paper train tickets from 2004. Two markers, of course, because this is a classics edition with comprehensive endnotes.</p>
<p>The main bookmark was around page 200, so I got a decent way into it. Except this is a book of over 800 pages, so actually not that far. I don&rsquo;t know why I stopped. Probably just got distracted by other books and petered out. I started from the beginning again this time, and found I remembered almost nothing of what I read nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<p>But enough meta story about my history with the book. What of the book itself?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really two main interwoven stories. The title character appears briefly, wordlessly, in the first scene, and then is not seen again for the whole of the first book (it was originally published serially, and is internally divided into eight books). First we get the start of the story of Gwendolen Harleth, a young woman of fair but limited means, who might expect to marry well. Until her family falls into poverty.</p>
<p>Her story at times feels like it&rsquo;s going to be a conventional, Austenesque romance. It is not, of course: it&rsquo;s much more complex than that.</p>
<p>The other story is about how Daniel Deronda rescues a young Jewish woman from self-inflicted drowning, and finds her a home, and what follows from that. This section is largely about the way Jews were treated at the time (the 1870s), and the idea that they might seek a homeland. The start of Zionism, in effect. Deronda is sympathetic to the plight of the Jews generally, as he is to Mirah, the woman he rescued. But then, he&rsquo;s synmpathetic to just about everyone.</p>
<p>The darkest part of this story shows us how terrifyingly restricted, locked down, controlled, a married woman could be in those times. Even if the husband in question is not physically violent, he simply controls all aspects of their lives, and hence her life. She has no hope of escape. It&rsquo;s powerfully understated, and all the more chilling for that.</p>
<p>Some sentences are overly long by modern standards, and some of the language is complex or old-fashioned enough to be confusing, but it usually becomes clear with careful reading. And it doesn&rsquo;t detract from the power of the storytelling.</p>

<p>I first heard of Mike Myers in 1985 or so, at the Edinburgh Fringe.
Someone was giving out flyers for a comedy show (I know, at the Fringe,
right?) If I remember correctly it was the opening night that evening,
at St John&rsquo;s on Prince&rsquo;s Street.</p>
<p>A comedy duo called Mullarkey and Myers. We had probably heard of Neil
Mullarkey, and there was an added incentive: a free bottle of Moosehead
beer (owing to the Canadian nature of one of the performers) if you
turned up with the flyer.</p>
<p>I don't remember anything about the show, but the name and its
existence stuck. Years later came <em>Shrek</em>, in which the same Mike Myers
did a Scottish accent for no very obvious reason. I assumed he had
learned it that year in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way he made this, too. It's fine, but I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/02/05/our-man-flint.html">already
watched <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our Man Flint<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this year</a>, so&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m realising I need to get back into the habit of putting things on the blog. More than film notes from Letterboxd and book notes. There won&rsquo;t be another book note for a while because I&rsquo;m reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daniel Deronda<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by George Eliot. It&rsquo;s 800 pages and I&rsquo;m around the 200 mark.</p>
<p>I started reading something else after Eastercon — did I mention I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastercon">Eastercon</a> this year? Oh, yes, <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/04/07/on-my-way.html">I did</a>, but only briefly. it was in Birmingham, but not in the heart of the city with its many curry restaurants. It was at the Hilton Metropole, out near the airport and NEC.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the guests of honour was Adrian Tchaikovsky, who I&rsquo;ve been aware of but never read for lo! this several years. He seemed personable and interesting, and my friend Simon recommended his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Children of Time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Turned out I already had that on my Kindle from some offer, so I started it.</p>
<p>And I stopped after about a third. I just wasn&rsquo;t really enjoying it. The spider characters were kind of interesting, and the human ones much less so, and I just didn&rsquo;t care that much about the plot.</p>
<p>Then I discovered that it&rsquo;s the start of a series (or at least that it has sequels, which is not necessarily the same thing). That just put me off more, because if I&rsquo;m not that interested in 400 pages or whatever, how much <em>less</em> interested am I going to be in three times that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in the business of reading things because I &ldquo;should&rdquo;, either because they&rsquo;re in some way classic, or just because I&rsquo;ve started them. Sorry Adrian, sorry Simon.</p>

			 <p>I bought <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781911310990">this</a> on my <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/04/09/conventions-conventionally-drink.html">recent visit to Eastercon</a>, from one of the authors, David Wake.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about the possibility of self-publishing before this, but Wake was on a panel about what to watch out for when you first get a publishing contract (his point: nothing, if you self-publish). He made some good points about the advantages of doing it yourself versus the traditional publishing route. For example, you don&rsquo;t send your sample chapters and synopsis in then wait two years for someone to decide. And even if they say yes, it could be another two years before your book is published.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which way I&rsquo;ll go with my <a href="https://devilgate.org/2023/04/06/just-after-midnight.html">recently-finished draft</a>, but I thought it was worth spending a fiver on this to check out the possibilities. And it seems a decent guide to how you can approach publishing both ebooks and paperbacks, for minimal outlay.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go into things like cover design and marketing, which, of course, are some of the things that traditional publishers handle.</p>
<p>I might give it a spin, though, with a novella that I&rsquo;ve got sitting around. We shall see.</p>
<p>Anyway, take a look at this if you&rsquo;re interested in the possibilities. <a href="https://punkpublishers.com/">Their website is here</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an excellent followup, with a very good summary of the previous novel at the start, which is useful. Top quality SF with politics. Scotland, and the Union (the EU++), are expanding into interstellar space, joining the other two power blocs.</p>
<p>Like the last, and perhaps even more so, this ends in a place that is quite satisfying. No cliffhangers, and if there were no more books, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Though at the same time it&rsquo;ll be great to see what happens in book 3.</p>

One interpretation or explanation for this strange experience is that she was trying to create (or find, or reach) a version of her life in which her beloved brother Teddy survives the Second World War and lives to grow old.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780385618700"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A God in Ruins<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> is the story of that timeline.</p>
<p>Or maybe a couple of timelines. While this is in most ways a more straightforward tale than its predecessor, we do see two or three possible different endings for Teddy. It&rsquo;s also about his descendants: his daughter the infuriating Viola, and her two children. It&rsquo;s kind of a redemption tale for some characters.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the bits about Teddy&rsquo;s wartime expreiences as a bomber pilot most. Overall it&rsquo;s not as good as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life After Life<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but not bad.</p>

<p>That case, though, is interesting. It was a sex-discrimination one<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> where the discriminated-against party was a man. He was a carer for his elderly mother, and the fact that he had never been married meant he wasn&rsquo;t entitled to a tax credit, where a woman would have been.</p>
<p>Ginsburg was able to convince the judges to declare the law unconstitutional, as it discriminated arbitrarily, on the titular basis. And with the ACLU, she was then able to tackle the many laws that discriminated similarly against women. Clever.</p>

<p>Or gender-discrimination, as they renamed it, because &lsquo;sex is all over the brief&rsquo;, and it would distract the judges — male, of course; at least, according to the film.

			 <p>To Cambridge, on Thursday just past, and to the Corn Exchange, to see Suzanne Vega. My one-word review: spellbinding.</p>
<p>I had never been to the Corn Exchange before (to be honest I&rsquo;ve rarely been to a gig — especially an indoor gig — outside London these last thirty-six or so years). But it&rsquo;s one of those places that feels slightly legendary to me, because I&rsquo;d see it listed among the tour dates in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sounds<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NME<!-- raw HTML omitted --> back in my youthhood.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s a lovely, clean, modern venue, with Old Speckled Hen on tap. We were seated in the balcony (on the balcony?), which was fine.</p>
<p>And as to Ms Vega: I&rsquo;m not steeped in her work, so the fact that she essentially played a &lsquo;Greatest Hits&rsquo; set was ideal for me. She even explicitly said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna play some of the well-known ones early, so people don&rsquo;t worry that they won&rsquo;t get them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This after she&rsquo;d opened with &lsquo;Marlene on the Wall&rsquo;, followed by &lsquo;Small Blue Thing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She had one accompanying musician, a guitarist called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Leonard">Gerry Leonard</a>, who has worked with Bowie, among others. He was great, making heavy use of those sampling/looping pedals, making him sometimes sound like three or four players at once.</p>
<p>So, like I say, the whole thing was spellbinding.

			 <p>Watty was  wearing a badge, one of the big, old kind. Probably two inches across, round. They used to advertise them in the back of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sounds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NME<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Record Mirror<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and I think there was a fourth member of the British weekly music press, but I can&rsquo;t recall it). They always included the size, in old-fashioned imperial units: one-inch, two-inch. Probably inch-and-a-half.</p>
<p>In the early days we wore the big ones. My first one was almost certainly a Beatles one, but I don&rsquo;t remember what design it had. I do recall a glittery Thin Lizzy one, when I went through my period of them being one of my faves. Wings, maybe? Probably.</p>
<p>Anyway, with punk, the badge size that was considered cool, or even acceptable, reduced. Anything bigger than an inch across would lead to mockery, for sure. Although I think Brendan&rsquo;s Stranglers badge, saying &lsquo;Something Better Change&rsquo; (&lsquo;Because I like the song and I like what it says&rsquo;) was of the two-inch persuasion, but that was in the early days.</p>
<p>Watty&rsquo;s one, the one that I&rsquo;m talking about: that was probably even earlier. It was white, with the outline of what I had to get quite close to realise was a penny farthing bicycle. And a number: 6.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that about, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/158671"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Prisoner<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>! Do you not know about it?&rsquo; Watty wasn&rsquo;t too bad in this way, but the default reaction to someone being ignorant of something you liked was mockery, back then, when we were 13, 14. To be honest, probably for a decade or more after that, too. Instead of the healthier attempt to infect the ignorant one with our own enthusiasm. Or at least inform them about it.</p>
<p>I learned, though, that it was a weird programme that was on late at night, and anyway it was over now, so even if it hadn&rsquo;t been on at a time that I wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to stay up on a school night, it was finished, so there was no chance I&rsquo;d ever get to see it.</p>
<p>Pity.</p>
<p>Of course, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Prisoner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was originally broadcast in 1967-8, so if Watty was watching it ten years later, it does show that repeats were a thing. If only there were a way we could have our own copies of TV programmes. But what a fantastic, farcical idea!</p>
<p>I know it was the early days, because the name &lsquo;The Prisoner&rsquo; did not immediately make me think of The Clash. The <a href="https://song.link/i/688798635">B-side</a> of &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/i/647246391">(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais</a>&rsquo; shares a title with Patrick McGoohan&rsquo;s paranoid cold-war ex-spy drama. I don&rsquo;t think it has anything else in common with it, but you can&rsquo;t be sure.</p>
<p>I finally saw some episodes in the early nineties. I bought some on VHS, along with my friend Johnny, who also hadn&rsquo;t seen it. But that didn&rsquo;t prove very practical, as we live in different cities. And VHS was expensive. Two episodes per tape for, what fifteen quid? So that petered out.</p>
<p>Much later I got the DVD box set. And it&rsquo;s been one of the things we&rsquo;ve been watching over the last few months. Er, years, maybe. It might have started in lockdown.</p>
<p>Tonight we finally watched the last two episodes. Which were much better than I had been led to believe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of amazing, saturated as it is with sixties fears about mind control, brainwashing, hypnotism. Is anything real after the unnamed main character gets gassed in the opening of the first episode (repeated in the opening credits of almost every episode)? Maybe the whole thing is a hallucination induced by the gas, you know?</p>
<p>There are certainly plenty of actual induced hallucinations or dreamlike states in the series. Which is why you can&rsquo;t trust the increasingly psychedelic ending.</p>
<p>The whole thing is a mindfuck. I loved it.</p>

<p>I remember seeing this as a kid and absolutely loving it. We talked about it at school, probably played at being Flint.</p>
<p>It’s a Bond spoof. James Coburn as Flint is a super agent who is brought out of retirement to save the world from some mad scientists who are controlling the weather.</p>
<p>I only remembered two things about it. His ability to stop his heart for maximum rest, and the device in his watch that got him started again; and his lighter, with ‘82 functions… 83 if you want to light a cigar.’</p>
<p>It’s daft nonsense, but fun in places. There’s even a lesser agent called 0008 (Triple Oh Eight) who tells him ‘It’s bigger than SPECTRE.)</p>
<p>Watched on Saturday February 4, 2023.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>First, cards on the table, Bob is a friend of mine. <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780957217409">Bomber Jackson Does Some</a> is his first novel, self-published in 2012. He gave us a copy back then, and it&rsquo;s taken me till now to read it.</p>
<p>Just because of the size of my to-read piles, not any quality concerns.</p>
<p>Bomber is an ex-boxer and an alcoholic. At the start of the novel he has just got out of prison. As you might imagine from such a setup, things largely go downhill from there. His thoughts include a fair amount of slang, some of which I didn&rsquo;t understand, but the meaning was usually clear from context. For example, he refers to two homeless men as &lsquo;real old-fashioned paraffins&rsquo;. Paraffin lamp = tramp, I assume.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written in first person, present tense, which I think is quite a hard voice to sustain. Bob does a good job of getting us inside Bomber&rsquo;s head, and the story flows along at fine old rate.</p>
<p>All in all, top stuff. Recommended if you can get hold of a copy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m shocked that I posted less than 100 times, but there you go. I&rsquo;ve been busy with other things.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other Things</h2>
<h3 id="writing-a-novel">Writing a Novel</h3>
<p>What time I had for writing outside of work, I tried to spend mainly on completing my novel. You&rsquo;ll recall that I did a <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">Creative Writing MA</a> in 2020–21. I graduated in May 2022. My <a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/09/17/dissertation-submitted.html">dissertation</a> was essentially the first 15,000 words of a novel (along with a preface on how it had all come together). I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/12/17/at-the-start.html">promised myself</a> that I&rsquo;d finish it by the end of the year. I haven&rsquo;t quite achieved that goal, but I expect to in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<h3 id="new-job">New Job</h3>
<p>But to that &lsquo;outside of work&rsquo;, above: I started a new job in February. I never quite got round to writing about it here, except on my <a href="https://devilgate.org/now/"><code>/now</code> page</a>, which is an infrequently-maintained page that&rsquo;s meant to say what I&rsquo;m up to at any time. I was and am glad to have it, of course, but it&rsquo;s amazing how much working 9–5:30 again takes away from your ability to do other things.</p>
<p>The job itself? I was employed as a Java Developer — that&rsquo;s literally in my job title — and I have written precisely zero lines of Java.</p>
<p>Instead, I found myself plunged into the exciting new world of infrastructure as code, or IaC, and the <a href="https://www.terraform.io">Terraform</a> language. I might write more about that at some point, but in short, it seems I work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> now, and I&rsquo;m enjoying it.</p>
<h4 id="digression-on-writing-at-work">Digression: On Writing at Work</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written over 70,000 words of a novel over the past year-and-a-half or so. But since February I&rsquo;ve written something like 100,000 words at work. This comes from keeping copious notes on what I&rsquo;ve being doing and what I&rsquo;ve learned, and so on. I thank <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> for making it easy to do so, and for working in a way that matches how I want to work. But I wonder: why didn&rsquo;t I keep notes like this before? I always wrote things down, of course, but not this systematically, this comprehensively.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mystery.</p>
<h3 id="jury-duty">Jury Duty</h3>
<p>In May I spent three weeks on a Jury at <a href="https://hornseyhistorical.org.uk/wood-green-crown-court-what-was-there-before/">Wood Green Crown Court</a>. That was an interesting experience. I might write more about it one day.</p>
<h3 id="etc">Etc</h3>
<p>And all the other things that make up life. Hey, I even read <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/books-2022/">33 books last year</a>!</p>

			 <p>Not just <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/12/30/knives-out.html">another</a> murder mystery, but an undeniably cosy one. OK, the deaths aren&rsquo;t cosy, obviously, but the mood and vibe of <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780241988275">the book</a> certainly is.</p>
<p>The club in question is made up of four residents at a retirement village. They start out by speculatively investigating cold cases that a former member, who had been a police officer, had records of. But soon a hot case lands right in front of them, and things get interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious in places, moving, well-plotted, and, let&rsquo;s face it, a tad unconvincing. But you don&rsquo;t let that bother you while you&rsquo;re reading it.</p>
<p>Which you should do.</p>

Then from the blurb we learn that Lou himself is a character in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781617756429">the story</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s a kind of coming-of-age novel about a seventeen-year-old boy from Queens in 1976 or so, who moves with his mother to Manhattan, and into the block where Lou Reed is also living. The boy, Matt, becomes something of a friend/assistant to Lou for a while.</p>
<p>In a parallel narrative, Matt falls for a girl at his new school, who might be involved in some withcrafty kind of stuff. It&rsquo;s not obvious exactly how the timelines of the two strands relate, but things come to a head — or a couple of heads, you could say.</p>
<p>The book closes with a chapter entitled &lsquo;Afterwords&rsquo; (note the plural) in which the narrator — or the author — writes after Lou&rsquo;s death. This section makes it seem as if the early section was based on real events. The author is a successful actor, so who knows?</p>
<p>I want to quote this from that last section, about Lou&rsquo;s music, because I love it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And more than anything else, it was punk. Which should come as no surprise since you were its creator. I don&rsquo;t care what Detroit says, you were doing it when Iggy was a mere Osterberg and Kramer was trying to figure out who the other four would be. As for the lads from my neck of the woods (famous for their <em>&ldquo;One, two, three, four&rdquo;</em> count-off and three power chords) who are considered by some as the progenitors of the movement… well, that just makes no sense chronologically or otherwise. Not to mention (but I will) that they basically wrote the same song over and over again. And however great a song it may be, it renders deep catalog cuts redundant. Sorry, kids, I guess you had to be there—on the Bowery when it happened. But I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the same goes for the little London boy. Just the first few sentences you speak to the audience on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Take No Prisoners<!-- raw HTML omitted --> relegates John-John to a corner with some crayons and a finger up his nose. The revolution you started was one of art and intellect. It inspired the defeat of tyranny in Czechoslovakia, for Christ&rsquo;s sake. God save the queen, indeed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;The little London boy.&rsquo; 😀</p>
<p>Something about the length, the writing style, and the age of the narrator, suggests that this book should or would be considered young-adult (YA). But the Lou Reed connection makes it much more likely that people in my age group will be drawn to it. I don&rsquo;t know what that means.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it, anyway. And it was a Christmas present from my daughter.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m quite pleased to have read as many as 31 books this year. Not sure quite how I&rsquo;ve managed it, what with writing my own, and starting a new job, and all. Partly a lot of rereading of page-turners, of course.</p>
<p>Le Guin&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780426064374">Rocannon&rsquo;s World</a> was not a reread for me, though I&rsquo;ve had it on my shelf for years. Bought second-hand, I&rsquo;m sure, I don&rsquo;t recall where or when, but it&rsquo;s an edition from 1978. And it&rsquo;s a super-slim volume. It probably wouldn&rsquo;t be classified as a novel at all, in today&rsquo;s publishing world. It&rsquo;s kind of a slight story, about a person from an advanced species — an Earth-human, essentially — getting stranded on a planet at bronze-age levels of technology, with various species of native humanoid.</p>
<p>The titular Rocannon has to make his way across the world to find the other high-level aliens who have caused him to be stranded, avenge himself, warn his people about their aggression, and maybe try to get rescued.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s maybe most notable for being, I believe, the place where Le Guin first used the term <em>Ansible</em> for s faster-than-light communication device. She went on to use it in many other novels, and other SF authors adopted it.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s also the name for something in IT automation. Infrastructure as code. Of which concept, though not Ansible, more later, probably.</p>

			 <p>I missed posting this yesterday, what with one thing and another. Twenty years ago yesterday, the 22<!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of December 2002, my friend Tony texted me and the other members of our then-band, Burn, to the effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nooooooooo!</p>
<p>Strummer&rsquo;s dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was at work, and immediately googled for the story.  Joe Strummer, dead at 50 from an undiagnosed heart defect. We didn&rsquo;t hear the reason at once, of course.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://devilgate.org/2002/12/23/the-death-of.html">The Death of a Hero</a> at the time. Not much has changed, in some ways. I still play his music, both The Clash and his solo stuff. I sometimes wonder what he&rsquo;d have to say about the times we live in now.</p>
<p>Hard to imagine he&rsquo;d have been 70 this year. Such is life, and death.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s amusing, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526643155">this one</a> coming straight after <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/11/22/the-books-of.html">this year&rsquo;s behemoth</a>, since the <a href="https://devilgate.org/2017/11/22/jerusalem-by-alan.html">last book I read by Moore</a> was a similar year-spanning (and reading-year-consuming) monster.</p>
<p>This one, however, is much more straightforward and shorter read than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jerusalem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a book of short stories. Or more accurately, a book containing some short stories and one that is more or less long enough to be a novel on its own.</p>
<p>That one — &lsquo;What We Can Know About Thunderman&rsquo; — is a fractured history of the US comics market. It tells of the two big companies — American and Goliath — and a few smaller ones that mostly got gobbled up over the years. American famously has the eponymous Man of Storms as its most famous character, along with King Bee, Moon Queen, and many more.</p>
<p>We get the stories of how various young fans attend conventions and end up as professionals, and what happens to some of them afterwards. But why are some odd things happening to people who work for American?</p>
<p>That one&rsquo;s the centrepiece, but I think my favourite might be &lsquo;American Light — An Appreciation&rsquo;. Subtitled as &lsquo;by C. F. Bird&rsquo;, it presents an annotated version of a poem, the &lsquo;American Light&rsquo; of the title, by a beat poet called Harmon Belner. In 26 pages and 86 footnotes, Moore manages to give us a pretty good beat poem, and tell parts of at least two life stories. You&rsquo;ve got to read all the footnotes, though.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The other stories are good, too. &lsquo;The Improbably Complex High-Energy State&rsquo; takes place in the first femtoseconds of the universe.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> &lsquo;Location, Location, Location&rsquo; is the story of an estate agent and her client after the world has ended.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>While not wrong, it ignores the fact that The Specials were bloody brilliant! The piece does make that clear later, to be fair, but it seems slightly the wrong way to weight it.</p>

<p>When I was a little kid my family used to go on holiday to
<a href="https://millport.org">Millport</a>, on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Cumbrae">Isle of
Cumbrae</a>,
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Clyde">Firth of
Clyde</a>.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t go to the cinema often, if ever, back then. But Millport had
a small cinema, and we always went once or twice when on holiday.</p>
<p>I don't recall any of the films we saw in the four years we holidayed
there. What I <em>do</em> remember is the film posters, because they were
always there, so I saw them year after year. And unusually, they were
round the walls inside the auditorium. So while you waited for the
lights to go down, you saw adverts for films that once shown there.</p>
<p>It's where I first heard of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dollars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> trilogy. Only the first two
then, in a double poster for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Fistful of Dollars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For a Few
Dollars More<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When Eight Bells Toll<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ice Station Zebra<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And one called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matt Helm Gets it in Denmark<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I eventually saw all the
others, but not that one. As I got a bit older, if ever the name came
back to me, I wondered what kind of &lsquo;getting it&rsquo; the title referred
to. I probably kind of looked like an adventure film, so it was probably
more likely to be a threat to his life, than any other interpretation.
But the <em>entendre</em> was clearly <em>double</em>.</p>
<p>I recently found that our Roku has a strangely-named channel called
&lsquo;Movieland Tv&rsquo; [<em>sic</em> as far as the lowercase &lsquo;v&rsquo; goes]. I had
a poke around, and it seems to specialise in old movies from the 60s and
70s that are not what might now be called classics. Though there are a
couple of Bond films: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thunderball<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the first Bond film I ever saw) and
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Diamonds are Forever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But I came across one called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Silencers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The blurb described it as
&lsquo;The first Matt Helm movie&rsquo;. Well! Here was the mysterious figure from
my childhood. If not getting it in Denmark, then at least in danger of
being silenced. The blurb also told us he was an agent who&rsquo;d got out of
the game and his superiors wanted him back.</p>
<p>Fair enough, sounds like it could be OK, and I fancied something like a
spy film tonight.</p>
<p>The first surprise was the star: Dean Martin. Now, that poster back in
Millport <em>might</em> have shown his name in large type, and if it did you&rsquo;d
think the collision of his last name with my first would have stuck with
me. But if so, that fact is lost in the mists of memory.</p>
<p>After an opening where four hit men are given bullets with &lsquo;Matt Helm&rsquo;
written on them, it starts with a woman dancing. And, basically,
stripping. It&rsquo;s obviously trying to be like a Bond opening scene, but,
way sub-even-that-standard.</p>
<p>And then another woman starts singing, and the credits include original
songs by Elmer Bernstein, and a choreographer. Is this a musical?</p>
<p>Well, no, but if you&rsquo;ve got Dean Martin in the studio, you&rsquo;d be daft
not to get him to sing a bit. Which he doesn&rsquo;t do in character, but
does in a couple of scenes in voiceover, in effect. Oh and there&rsquo;s a
joke with Sinatra coming on the radio and Helm saying, &lsquo;Turn that off,
I can&rsquo;t stand his voice.&rsquo; They retune, and a Dean Martin song comes
on, and he says. &lsquo;Now this guy can sing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I know, it&rsquo;s not much of a joke.</p>
<p>It's a daft spy romp, and from Helm&rsquo;s amorous adventures, I think
it's now clear which kind of &lsquo;getting it&rsquo; will be happing in Denmark.
Though probably a bit of both.</p>
<p>I'm giving it one star for making me laugh several times, though mainly
at the ridiculousness. And half a star for the fantastic mobile bed. Why
move to answer the phone when you can flick a switch and have your bed
rotate you to where it is? And when you want to have a bath, just let
your bed take you there and drop you in.</p>
<p>Honestly, that bit wouldn&rsquo;t have been out of place on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Island">Tracy
Island</a>.</p>
<p>Other than that, it&rsquo;s complete mince.</p>

He converted to Islam, then to Catholicism, taking his followers with him on the second of those changes. But they remained &lsquo;true believers&rsquo;, treating Frank as the true Messiah.</p>
<p>It took me so long to read partly because it&rsquo;s so long, and certainly not because it was uninteresting. In fact it&rsquo;s surprisingly compelling, considering the subject matter. But it is complex. Not least because of all the Polish place names and names of people. The latter is compounded when they get baptised into the Catholic church. They take on new names, so now most characters have two sets of names.</p>
<p>I got a surprise when I first picked up the book to find that it&rsquo;s numbered backwards. Chapter 1 of Book 1 starts on page 892. The story ends on page 27. (There are some notes and blank pages after that.)  At first I thought I might have to read it &lsquo;backwards&rsquo;, but no: the story proceeds in the direction I&rsquo;m used to. It&rsquo;s just the numbering.</p>
<p>I wondered if this was a reference to the direction of Hebrew writing, and Tokarczuk&rsquo;s note at the end confirms that it is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as well as a reminder that every order, every system, is simply a matter of what you&rsquo;ve got used to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is fair enough. I quite liked knowing how many pages I still had to go, with having to subtract. Especially as I got near the end.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, in the last couple of weeks I read this in  &lsquo;<a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/shift-happens/issues/some-good-news-1458208">Shift Happens</a>&rsquo;, a newsletter about a book about keyboards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(in Poland and parts of Europe, books have their tables of contents at the end, and so will mine).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which isn&rsquo;t the case here, but I thought it was an interesting slightly-connected idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge work, in more ways than one, and also an incredible example of the translator&rsquo;s art.</p>

			 <p>Since Musk&rsquo;s takeover of Twitter has been confirmed, there has been a lot of chatter about free speech. Musk, we are told, describes himself as a &lsquo;free speech maximalist&rsquo;, and there are fears that he&rsquo;ll have Twitter reinstate the accounts of Trump and other white supremacists.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Joe Strummer.</p>
<p>More specifically, I&rsquo;ve been wondering why his &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1443369287">The Road to Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll</a>&rsquo; was popping into my head so often. It wasn&rsquo;t a problem: getting an earworm of a song I like doesn&rsquo;t bother me. But I wondered what was triggering it.</p>
<p>I can often work out why I get a song in my head. I knew, for example, why I often had The Clash&rsquo;s &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/gb/i/688798635">The Prisoner</a> ' in my head through the summer. The words &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner">The Prisoner</a> ' are written on the whiteboard in our kitchen, along with the titles of the other serieses we&rsquo;re watching.</p>
<p>And in fact I sing &lsquo;The Prisoner&rsquo; every time I hang out the washing, owing to its line referring to &lsquo;hanging out the washing and clipping coupons and generally being decent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It clicked today, though. You know how — if you&rsquo;re an old-school album listener (or just old) like me — when you play an album, one track&rsquo;s ending often triggers the expectation of the next? So that, when you hear a song in isolation, on a playlist or on the radio or something, and the wrong song plays next, it can be quite jarring?</p>
<p>The song before &lsquo;The Road to Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll&rsquo; on <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1443368778"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rock Art and the X-Ray Style<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> is &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1443369281">Techno D-Day</a>&rsquo;. Joe&rsquo;s celebration of illegal raves ends with the line, &lsquo;And this is about free speech!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So it turns out my head was just playing the next song whenever the phrase came up.</p>

<p>This has been a most enjoyable experience, reading through the whole series. Rereading this one so soon was an excellent opportunity to see if I could spot any clues that I missed the first time (certainly one or two).</p>
<p>The apparent logical jumps the characters make at the climax made more sense this time, so that was good.</p>
<p>Excellent stuff. I look forward to the next one.</p>

<p>Martin McDonagh&rsquo;s latest is sad, hilarious, tragic, and true. Or feels like it could be true, even if some of the decisions characters make are baffling, to say nothing of gruesome.</p>
<p>On a rugged, beautiful island off the coast of Ireland in 1923, with the civil war going on on the mainland, two friends fall out. Or rather, one says he doesn&rsquo;t like the other any more. A whole sequence of events flow out from this simple, almost child-like choice.</p>
<p>The funniest part happens when one of them goes to confession.But that&rsquo;s only to be expected: confession&rsquo;s a pretty funny kind of thing, when you think about it.</p>

<p>Also back then, I was recovering from being sick. This time I was just starting to be.

I was reading that and thinking, &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m definitely getting it.&rsquo; <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/10/06/well-damn-as.html">And not flu</a>.</p>

<p>Politics is the background for this one, with Robin going undercover at the House of Commons to try to find out who&rsquo;s blackmailing a government minister — or rather, why? The blackmailers are known, but nobody outside of the minister&rsquo;s family knows what it is they have on him.</p>
<p>All good stuff, as ever. I had totally forgotten who was behind it all (where &lsquo;it&rsquo; is the murder that follows the blackmail), which just goes to show you can easily enjoy a whodunit <a href="https://devilgate.org/2018/10/04/lethal-white-by.html">a second time</a>.</p>

			 <p>God, I have missed this <em>so</em> much. Live music FTW.</p>
<p>I get emails from the <a href="https://joestrummerfoundation.org">Joe Strummer Foundation</a> . The most recent one told me that their <a href="https://joestrummerfoundation.org/gemma-rogers-jsfs-featured-artist-for-september/">artist of the month for September</a>  was someone called <a href="https://www.gemmarogersmusic.com">Gemma Rogers</a>. I hadn&rsquo;t heard of her, but was interested when I read that she&rsquo;d had an album launch at <a href="https://paperdressvintage.co.uk">Paper Dress Vintage</a>. That&rsquo;s a place just down the road from me on the Narrow Way. It used to just be a second-hand clothes shop, but now it&rsquo;s more, I guess.</p>
<p>Anyway, the thought that she might be a local piqued my interest, as well as the JSF recommendation, so I gave her a listen, and liked what I heard a lot.</p>
<p>She was booked to play at a place called <a href="https://www.folklorehoxton.com/info">Folklore</a>, on Hackney Road, so I thought, why not? In support was <a href="https://www.gabigarbutt.com">Gabi Garbutt and the Illuminations</a> , who I saw once a few years back, because <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/336678-Sean-Read">Sean Read</a>, whom I know from round these parts, was producing them and playing in the band. Back then. Not anymore. Not tonight, at least.</p>
<p>Going to a gig in a small venue? No big deal, right? Except… this is the first gig I&rsquo;ve been to since I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/03/01/glen-matlock-remembers.html">saw Glen Matlock</a>. At the end of February 2020.</p>
<p>It felt like quite a step.</p>
<p>But after a bite to eat across the road, we made our way in through forbidding, castle-like doors. Inside is a smallish bar area, and a classic pub backroom. The stage made of two layers of forklift pallets topped with hardboard. It was smoky. Visually, it was like being back in the eighties. But of course, it was stage smoke-machine smoke. Exactly why it filled the air before anyone had taken to the stage escapes me.</p>
<p>Unless it was to show the lasers. It looked like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway, Veronica  Bianqui brought her Hollywood-fuelled LA tones to Hackney Road. Though it turned out she had been on the bus with us down from Clapton.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I probably enjoyed Gabi Garbutt&rsquo;s performance most of the three. Because at times? At times they sounded a bit like late-period Clash.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They sounded. Like. The Clash. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Combat Rock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-era. I think it was mainly the bass player sounding a bit like Paul Simonon. Whatever, I can pay no higher compliment. No higher compliment <em>can</em> be paid.</p>
<p>But Gemma Rogers was also great, with the singalong of &lsquo;Rabbit Hole&rsquo; being the highlight. Not often you get the band applauding the audience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But yes: I had missed it so much more than I realised. Just getting together in room with a hundred or so people, while others make rocking sounds up the front? How could I have forgotten?</p>

			 <p>I surprised myself, really. I, an avowed republican and atheist, watched the Queen&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>It was a historic event, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that. If only because we need reminding once in a while that we live in a militarist theocracy.</p>
<p>Sure, the Prime Minister — elected, but just barely having any democratic legitimacy — was involved, reading one of the weird stories from the strange Christian book, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bible<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But look at the start of the ceremony. The military led the march to the church, surrounding the coffin throughout. Just inside the doorway they handed over to the religionists, who led them down the aisle.</p>
<p>All the living Prime Ministers were there, and some other politicians too, I expect. But it was not a day for them, for the elected; nor for their electors, for &lsquo;commoners&rsquo;, except to bow their heads and throw flowers.</p>
<p>I kept an eye on Twitter throughout, but it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as snarky as I imagined. A few comments about dropped papers and spiders, but mostly just revelling in it.</p>

Mainly, I think, because I wanted to stay with these characters. As I type I&rsquo;ve just finished the second in the series.</p>
<p>The characters, though, are very different back here. Well, Strike not so much. Robin is new-minted, still unformed, and doesn&rsquo;t get nearly as much pagetime as she deservedly does in later books.</p>
<p>Good stuff, this tale of a famous model who dies in a fall from a balcony. The police have written it off as suicide, but Strike, when asked to investigate, has other ideas.</p>
<p>Keeping the whodunit alive, I had completely forgotten who actually was the guilty party. Or rather, I remembered it as being someone other than it was. So I was surprised by it, which you don&rsquo;t really expect on a rereading.</p>

<p>Aaron Sorkin not quite at his best. Decent film, based on the memoir of Molly Bloom. Who is nothing to do with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ulysses<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but parents who either were huge James Joyce fans, or had no knowledge of him whatsoever. I lean toward the latter.</p>
<p>She nearly becomes an Olympic skier, but is put out of action by injury. She falls into helping to run a poker game for extremely rich people. Takes it over and it becomes even bigger, even richer.</p>
<p>Even more dangerous. The mob gets involved. The FBI get involved.</p>
<p>Great dialogue, as you&rsquo;d expect, but mostly presented by characters who are seated, rather than walking at high speed. Perhaps playing poker while walking at high speed would have improved the whole thing.</p>
<p>Not bad, though.</p>

			 <p>This may be the best so far of the Strike books. My favourite so far, anyway.</p>
<p>Despite being set in 2015 (time flows differently in Galbraith world) it&rsquo;s very much of now. People being bullied online, right-wing terrorist organisations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossrail">Crossrail</a> still being built. Oh wait, they finished that. If the novels ever catch up with reality, Cormoran and Robin won&rsquo;t have to pick their way past roadworks around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_Street">Denmark Street</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://strikefans.com/the-tottenham-pub/">The Tottenham</a> pub won&rsquo;t be there any more. What will Strike do then? Well, OK, he&rsquo;ll just complain about it being renamed The Flying Horse, I imagine. I think I was in The Tottenham once, years and years ago, and didn&rsquo;t think too much of it. But who knows.</p>
<p>Anyway, the book! Yes, it is excellent. I loved it. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t like was the sheer physical size. It&rsquo;s over 1000 pages, and when it&rsquo;s not breaking your wrists, it feels like it&rsquo;s breaking its own spine.</p>
<p>The titular Ink-Black Heart (it should, of course, be hyphenated, as an adjectival phrase) is a cartoon series, initially on YouTube, moved to Netflix. Having read the description, I really want to see it.</p>
<p>It spawns a fan-created game, and therein lies the problem. Fans, you know? They can be troublesome types. Even dangerous.</p>
<p>Parts of the book are presented as in-game chat threads, with up to three streams running in parallel down the pages. It could get very confusing. It doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Read.</p>

			 <p>Yes, I&rsquo;m only reading Iain Banks at the moment. What of it? Or I was for a brief period up until the book after this.</p>
<p>Probably my favourite Culture novel, and possibly the best. Mainly because the ships are most prominent and coolest and it&rsquo;s all just huge <em>fun</em>!</p>
<p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2013/10/16/201431.html">talked about it back in 2013</a> god how can this have been going on for so long? Where by &lsquo;this&rsquo; I mean <a href="/blog/tag/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a>. On the other hand, I suppose as long as I reread his books, it&rsquo;ll be going on, no matter how many &rsquo;re-' prefixes we might want to apply.</p>
<p>There are a couple, though none of the SF, that I&rsquo;ve still only read once. I think maybe literally a couple: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stonemouth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Quarry<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And one, the poetry collection (with <a href="/blog/tag/ken-macleod/">Ken McLeod</a>), that I&rsquo;ve only partly read.</p>
<p>But anyway, <a href="https://theculture.fandom.com/wiki/Excession_(novel)"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Excession<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>: pure dead brilliant. If by some odd means you&rsquo;ve read his SF and haven&rsquo;t got to this yet, you have a treat in store for you. Or if you&rsquo;re just starting out. Or if you&rsquo;re re-re-rereading, like me.</p>
<p>The Culture meet an object? Entity? Being? That they don&rsquo;t understand and can&rsquo;t cope with. An <a href="https://theculture.fandom.com/wiki/Outside_Context_Problem">Outside Context Problem</a>, as they call it. It&rsquo;s excessive, so it&rsquo;s an excession. Things are set in motion. (Some of them very very fast things.)</p>

			 <p>Banksie&rsquo;s most political book, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say. In the sense that the real-world politics and opinions of the author and the first-person narrator most closely align, and that it was written at about the time it is set and is often <em>about</em> the time it was written, as well.</p>
<p>It starts on 9/11, though that tragic event is only background. A London-based Scottish radio DJ and commentator gets up to mischief and into trouble.</p>
<p>It stands up well twenty years on.</p>

			 <p>The last of the Culture books and Banksie&rsquo;s SF books, both at all, and that I had only read once.</p>
<p>The odd one about this, as a Culture book, I realised only very late on, is that neither Special Circumstances nor even Contact are involved, directly. Just a random grouping of ships who take an interest in the matter.</p>
<p>The matter in question being the decision of a species called the Gzilt to sublime, or leave the material realm for higher dimensions. This a common endpoint (or new beginning) for civilisations in the Culture universe, and I wonder whether, had Iain lived, he would have taken us to the point where The Culture itself was making that decision.</p>
<p>Anyway, the sonata in question is one that is barely playable because it was written for &lsquo;an instrument not yet invented&rsquo;, which turns out to be be the Antagonistic Undecagonstring, or Elevenstring. An instrument with some 24 strings (some not counted in the name, because they are not played, they just resonate) designed to be played with two bows simultaneously.</p>
<p>Our hero — or at least, the main humanoid viewpoint character — Vyr Cossont, has been surgically adapted to have an extra pair of arms to allow her to play it. It is still next to impossible, but she has made it her &lsquo;life task&rsquo;: something to do while waiting for the day when your civilisation sublimes. The decision for them to go was made long before she was born.</p>
<p>But her playing the sonata is only a side issue. The real problem is that maybe someone is trying to sabotage the sublimation. Or maybe not, but odd things are afoot, and various people and ships get involved, and it&rsquo;s all a whole shitload of fun.</p>

			 <p>On <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">my MA course</a>, in the Creative Nonfiction module, we were assigned the first chapter of this as one of our readings. It intrigued me enough that I ordered a copy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pagesofhackney.co.uk">Pages of Hackney</a> had to order it from the US, and it took a long time to arrive. The module (and possibly the course, though I don&rsquo;t actually think so) had finished by the time it arrived.</p>
<p>It took me even longer to finish reading it, despite it being a very slim volume.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s subtitled &lsquo;The Art of Personal Memoir&rsquo;. She starts one section by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thirty years ago people who thought they had a story to tell sat down to write a novel. Today they sit down to write a memoir.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it was published in 2001, so she was seeing a change since the seventies. That may be even more true now, as creative nonfiction, memoir, the confessional story: that&rsquo;s a huge publishing category.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure to what extent this book will help people who want to sit down and write one.</p>
<p>Gornick likes to teach by example. I would estimate that between 40 and 50% of the words in this book are other people&rsquo;s. All properly cited and credited, of course, and the relevant permissions listed at the back. But she uses huge long quotes.</p>
<p>Nothing inherently wrong with that, of course. How else do we first learn to write at all, other than by the examples of things we read? But I felt she spent too much time quoting the examples, and not enough explaining <em>why</em> she chose those. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe use smaller examples, or break the big quotes up with interjections on technique.</p>
<p>Early in the book she talks about the nonfiction writer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here the the writer must identify openly with those very same defenses [<em>sic</em>] and embarrassments that the novelist or the poet is once removed from. It&rsquo;s like lying down on the couch in public … Think about how many years on the couch it takes to speak about oneself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The casual synecdoche of &lsquo;couch&rsquo; to mean &lsquo;therapy&rsquo; or &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; amused me. So commonplace must analysis be in her circles, that she assumes everyone knows what &lsquo;lying down on the couch&rsquo; is like. Whereas most of us, I would guess, only know about it from seeing it in films.</p>

			 <p>Not strictly a book, but a <a href="https://interzone.press">double issue of a short-story magazine</a> seems substantial enough to treat as one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when the last issue came out, but I had actually forgotten that I still had a subscription. It was good to get this, not least because it&rsquo;s going to be the last to be edited by Andy Cox and published by TTA Press — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interzone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 2.0, we might call it, after the David Pringle years.</p>
<p>From the next issue the editor will be Gareth Jelley, and the publisher MYY Press. The surprising thing about that is that the press is based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw">Wrocław</a>, in Poland. Which is odd because then, is it a British SF magazine anymore?</p>
<p>That probably doesn&rsquo;t matter, because of course it&rsquo;s an international genre, and it&rsquo;s not like they ever only published British writers. But still, quite a dramatic shift. It&rsquo;ll be intersting to see how the magazine changes.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this a lot. There was perhaps too much <a href="https://twitter.com/glassworks18">Alexander Glass</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> — three stories and an interview — but I guess sometimes you have a special focus for an issue (or two). And they&rsquo;re all good.</p>
<p>Several of the stories suffer from something I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/2014/07/21/notexactlybooks-what-has.html">complained about before</a>, which is to say, they don&rsquo;t have endings. Or, put another way, the authors chose to end them at a point that I find unsatisfying; or I don&rsquo;t understand <em>why</em> they chose to end there.</p>
<p>But in this case, I don&rsquo;t think any of the ending-choices let the stories down too. much.</p>

			 <p>This starts out with the main character escaping from some obscure threat and reaching a friend&rsquo;s place. The friend sends him into the past — so you think it&rsquo;s going to be a time-travel story. In the past he tries to save a struggling artist by giving him gold.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the last we hear of time travel. It&rsquo;s actually a story of humans who have attained bodily immortality through various traumatic incidents, and things going on with them. There&rsquo;s some space travel, and, not surprisingly given the tite, a computer connection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty strange in the way that Bester can be. Not one of his best, but interesting enough. Harlan Ellison praises it — and Bester — highly in the introduction.</p>
<p>I had one of those, &lsquo;Have I read this before?&rsquo; experiences through the first few chapters, but it soon stopped. So I wonder if I started it once before. If so, I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;d have stopped, as it kept me going this time.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;ve read any of Priest&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dream Archipelago&rsquo; stories before now. Certainly the <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/christopher-priest/">ones that I&rsquo;ve tagged with his name</a> are all outside of that loosely-connected set.

<p><a href="https://christopher-priest.co.uk/books/the-islanders-2">This one</a>, though, well.</p>
<p>Its conceit is that it is a gazeteer of the Dream Archipelago (which is, I&rsquo;m slightly surprised to discover, what its residents call it: I had thought it was more… <em>dreamy</em> than that).</p>
<p>The archipelago is essentially impossible to map, because of some kind of time-distorting vortices that occur over the world it is on. No one is sure how many islands there are or the names or locations of even the main ones. The writers of the gazeteer try their best in any case.</p>
<p>By way of the would-be-factual entries, plus a number of fairly straightforward short stories (which don&rsquo;t fit the gazeteer format, but then nothing really &lsquo;fits&rsquo; here) we get something of the backstory of the archipelago, and fragments of the lives of a few of its prominent citizens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all highly readable and makes me want to know more about this odd world and its people (who seem to be essentially human).</p>

			 <p>&lsquo;<a href="https://www.valmcdermid.com/still-life/">A Karen Pirie thriller</a>,&rsquo; the description on the cover says of this. I&rsquo;m not sure &lsquo;thriller&rsquo; is quite the right term. It&rsquo;s exciting enough, but there isn&rsquo;t the tension that would take it up to &lsquo;thriller&rsquo; level. Not least because Karen Pirie is never in any danger, other than possibly pissing off her boss, the deputy chief constable of Police Scotland.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read Val McDermid before, so picking up one of her later ones — possibly her latest: published in 2020, set just before the pandemic, and ending as lockdown starts — would be a strange choice. But sometimes you&rsquo;re in a holiday house and there are some books and it&rsquo;s not so much a choice as an offering. I&rsquo;ve fancied checking out some <em>tartan noir</em> for a while, anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. I enjoy a crime novel from time to time, and this one certainly kept the pages turning. Backstory was filled in very efficiently, without it feeling like infodumping. And reading about the chill autumn in Scotland (with slight detours into France, the north of England, and Ireland) took the edge off some of the Greek heat.</p>
<p>The title is a little confusing. There is some art involved in the story, but none of it is a still life. There&rsquo;s at least a double meaning to the phrase, of course, and that makes sense in context. But maybe the French term, <em>nature mort</em>, is even more applicable. Not least since Karen Pirie works cold cases for the Scottish police force.</p>

			 <p>Greece is probably the best place to read <a href="https://pollysamson.com/books.htm">this novel</a>, which is good, because that was where I was when I read it. It&rsquo;s a work of fiction mostly set on the real island of Hydra during 1960-61. There was a famous community of anglophone expats there at the time, one of whom was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Ihlen">Marianne Ihlen</a>. They were notably joined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Cohen">Leonard Cohen</a>.</p>
<p>The first-person narrator is fictional, but nearly every other character is real. It&rsquo;s an unusual approach for a contemporary novel, though perhaps not for historical fiction. Which, at sixty years distance, you could consider this. Some of the people are still alive, though, which is probably what makes it feel a bit odd.</p>
<p>Not Leonard or Marianne, though. The books starts with the narrator visiting Cohen&rsquo;s old house on the morning after his death was announced. Which — and I had forgotten this — was just after Trump got elected. Everything else is flashback.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very good. Captures the feeling of a Greek island summer, the listlessness of the young drifters, and the bitterness of the older writers who still struggle for success.</p>

I&rsquo;ll read the other two, since I&rsquo;ve got the combined edition on my Kindle, and they&rsquo;re not very long. But there&rsquo;s a spark that Rucker has when he writes about things like infinities, that just isn&rsquo;t there when he writes about the themes here.</p>
<p>Which are artificial intelligence, machine sentience, and the possibility of transferring human consciousnesses into robot bodies and vice versa. Those are fascinating concepts, but the stories don&rsquo;t quite jump off the page enough for me.</p>

			 <p>I had associated this in my head with Dick&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VALIS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is one of his latest works (written 1978, published 1981, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valis_(novel_series)">according to Wikipedia</a>). I think just because of the similarity of names.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ubik<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> is in fact more of a mid-period novel (written 1966, published 1969), and it shows. Though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik">according to the Wikipedia entry</a>, &lsquo;it was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest novels since 1923.&rsquo; I find that a tad surprising, as it&rsquo;s far from one of his better ones to my mind.</p>
<p>Certainly some of his tropes are there: strange warps to reality, confusion over who is and isn&rsquo;t dead, that sort of thing. But it&rsquo;s just not as compelling as, say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Scanner Darkly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; nor as weird and fascinating as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VALIS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The characterisation is weak — which is probably true for most of Dick&rsquo;s work, to be fair. But the story just doesn&rsquo;t really get off the ground.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/2022/06/01/inverted-world-by.html">read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inverted World<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> on the Kindle. It always annoys me that you&rsquo;re put at the start of the text on opening. I like to go back to the cover and work forward. Sometimes I use the contents links for that, and I think I might have done so here, skipping the introduction, because they nearly always contain spoilers.</p>
<p>So I started with the famous opening sentence I wrote about. But because I linked to the book&rsquo;s Wikipedia page, I skimmed the article. Which mentioned a prologue, that I had somehow missed.</p>
<p>As it happens, missing the prologue didn&rsquo;t really matter, didn&rsquo;t affect my enjoyment of the book. But first, I don&rsquo;t know how people can refer to the first sentence of Chapter 1 as the opening sentence, when there&rsquo;s a prologue full of sentences before it.</p>
<p>And second, be careful how you read your ebooks. You might miss something.</p>

			 <p>With its fairly famous opening line — &lsquo;I had reached the age of six hundred and fifty miles.&rsquo; — I kind of thought I had read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_World">this</a> before, long ago, maybe as a teenager. But no. It turned out definitely not.</p>
<p>A young man learns his place in a city — Earth City, as they call it — which is moving. Rails are placed before it and lifted up behind it so they can be laid in front again. The city is winched along on the rails by fits and starts. Why? Why is it in motion, and why do the inhabitants work desperately to keep it so? And why is the fact kept hidden from city dwellers who are not &lsquo;guildsmen&rsquo;?</p>
<p>The answers, or some of them, are within. Though there is no answer to why &lsquo;guildsmen&rsquo; is the correct word. Women are second-class citizens in the city. And worse outside it, on the whole.</p>
<p>The people of the city are human, they speak English mostly. They know their ancestors were from Earth planet, as they refer to it. The people in the villages they pass also seem to be human, and they mostly speak Spanish. The sun appears not as a sphere, but as a kind of disk with spikes top and bottom. What can be going on? The title suggests some kind of inversion, but what is it?</p>
<p>Ultimately the mystery isn&rsquo;t solved in a very interesting way, and the ending is sad, but maybe happy, but maybe sad.</p>
<p>Priest has written much better books, but it bears reading.</p>

			 <p>This was prompted by a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article — listicle, you might say, since it&rsquo;s basically a big list — of books for the summer (last summer): <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/summer-reading-the-50-hottest-new-books-everyone-should-read">Summer reading: the 50 hottest new books everyone should read</a>. I borrowed it from my local library. Kind of great that you can borrow ebooks from the library. Especially during lockdowns, when the buildings themselves were closed.</p>
<p>It is a magic realist novel set mostly in Britain and faerie; or the <em>sidhe</em>, as it&rsquo;s called here. It starts with the story of the tragic death of the main character&rsquo;s sister, when they were both in their late teens or early twenties. Was it murder? certainly the driver of the car that killed her was imprisoned.</p>
<p>The loss of her sister haunts Taryn&rsquo;s life, predictably. But if there are hints that the death is somehow linked to the other mysteries that run through the book, then it is never satisfactorily resolved that there is or isn&rsquo;t any connection.</p>
<p>That aside, we soon find ourselves — unexpectedly, for me at least — in another world. It seems that all the otherworlds exist: Munin and Huggin, Odin&rsquo;s ravens, turn up. We hear that &lsquo;The Great God of the Deserts&rsquo; went mad because his believers had too many different ideas of what he was like, so heaven is closed. A visit to purgatory is made.</p>
<p>Taryn finds out she is damned, because of an action she took — or didn&rsquo;t take, a sin of omission — regarding her sister&rsquo;s killer. And seems to accept this, and another evil at the heart of the Sidhe, without trying to understand it, without raging against it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, but there are definite weaknesses. I found the action scenes very confusing. Some of the geographical descriptions, too. And it feels a bit… maybe <em>unfocused</em> is the word? Hard to say what exactly I mean by that, but I guess it&rsquo;s that some things are hinted at when they should be explained. At least eventually.</p>
<p>There are a few oddities. It&rsquo;s set mostly in Britain, but some Americanisms creep in where they wouldn&rsquo;t. Can&rsquo;t think of any specific examples, but it&rsquo;s on the level of saying &lsquo;highway&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;motorway&rsquo;. That kind of thing.</p>
<p>Well worth a look, though.</p>

			 <p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to write anything about Elon Musk buying Twitter, because I mostly don&rsquo;t care. But Robin Sloan, in his newsletter, which isn&rsquo;t really a newsletter, because he just sends a link to a <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lostthread/">blog post</a> (with a few added words), says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An industrialist intends to purchase Twitter, Inc. His substantial success launching reusable spaceships does nothing to prepare him for the challenge of building social spaces. The latter calls on every liberal art at once, while the former is just rocket science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to quote that because I loved &lsquo;just rocket science.&rsquo; The common expression, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not rocket science&rsquo; has always mildly amused me, as a physics graduate. Because rocket science is <em>relatively</em> both simple and easy. It&rsquo;s straightforward Newtonian physics. Mass. Acceleration. Forces. The physics is simple, the sums are easy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go anywhere near even Special Relativity (still straightforward, if harder), General Relativity (much more complex), or of course anywhere close to quantum physics (frankly the most complex and confusing thing of all).</p>
<p>All of which is just to say that physics has more and less difficult areas. Rocket <em>engineering</em>, of course, is quite another matter. There you&rsquo;ve got all sort of complex materials science, chemistry, end even — if crew are involved — biology, sociology, psychology. Those are <em>much</em> harder.</p>
<p>As far as common similes for the ease of something go, I&rsquo;ve always preferred &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not brain surgery.&rsquo;  If I think about it I&rsquo;m amazed that operating successfully on a living human brain is even possible, and I bow my head to those who can do it. While hoping they&rsquo;ll never have to go near said bowed object, of course.</p>
<p>Anyway, that would have been that for this post, except that I pasted the above quote from Sloan into a text editor. But it didn&rsquo;t look like it does above. It looked like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>An indus-tri-al-ist intends to pur-chase Twit-ter, Inc. His sub-stan-tial suc-cess launch-ing reusable space-ships does noth-ing to pre-pare him for the chal-lenge of build-ing social spaces. The lat-ter calls on every lib-eral art at once, while the for-mer is just rocket science.
</code></pre><p>Where did all those hyphens come from? They look like they&rsquo;re non-printing characters. Ones that won&rsquo;t show up when a web page is rendered, but are there in the source code. Why? I can only imagine two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>a deliberate ploy to make it harder to copy quotes, as I have done above. But Sloan is a pro-web kinda guy, as far as I can tell. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like something he&rsquo;d do.</li>
<li>A glitch. An artifact of the software he used to create the post. It&rsquo;s most likely that. Weird one, though.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stranger still is that the character is not even a hyphen. As I discovered when I search-and-replaced it in BBEdit, it actually appears to be this: <code>\x{AD}</code>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that is. Some kind of hexadecimal representation of something. An invisible hyphen, presumably. Which I had to search-and-replace with actual hyphens to make them visible above. Looking at the source code, it&rsquo;s written as the HTML entity <code>&amp;shy;</code>, which the DuckDuck tells me is a &lsquo;soft hyphen&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All very odd.</p>
<p>I have positive feelings about Sloan, except for his closing image. I&rsquo;ll risk another paste:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wishful descriptions of Twitter as 	<!-- raw HTML omitted -->“the de facto public town square”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“the closest thing we have to a global consciousness”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sound, to me, like Peter Pan begging the audience to clap and raise a swooning Tinkerbell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don’t have to clap.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, but… of <em>course</em> you have to clap. Without wanting to get all metaphysical on you, if you don&rsquo;t clap when Tinkerbell is dying, you&rsquo;ve got no soul.</p>

			 <p>This came to me by way of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/summer-reading-the-50-hottest-new-books-everyone-should-read">summer reading</a> recommendations last year. I ended up reading it in the tail end of winter, or spring, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/15/luckenbooth-by-jenni-fagan-review-brilliantly-strange?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">his review</a>, M John Harrison describes it as &lsquo;brilliantly strange&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s about right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tale told across times, and tied to place. That place is number 10 Luckenbooth Close, in Edinburgh. Just off The Royal Mile, in fact, which is a place I lived as a student. I was in an alley called James Court, though, not the fictional Luckenbooth Close.</p>
<p>The close may be fictional, but the idea is not: <a href="https://luckenboothsedinburgh.co.uk/history/">luckenbooths</a>  were a kind of market stall in the High Street (part of The Royal Mile). Presumably that&rsquo;s where Fagan got the street name from.</p>
<p>Though I discover today that a luckenbooth is <em>also</em> a piece of jewellery: a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luckenbooth_brooch">heart-shaped brooch</a> , named after the <a href="https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luckenbooths">market stalls</a> in turn.</p>
<p>The book, though, is about none of those things. Instead it&rsquo;s about a series of people who live in the titular tenement block across the centuries. We start with the Devil&rsquo;s daughter, who — well, I won&rsquo;t go into spoilery details. William Burroughs is one of the characters, strangely. Apparently he <a href="https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/06/10/burroughs-and-scotland/">did visit Edinburgh</a>.</p>
<p>It is an astonishing work, involving the saving of ghosts, murders, the Millennium celebrations, homelessness, and much more. Highly recommended.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a strange set of opinions popping up on Twitter over the last week or so, essentially blaming the US, the UK, and/or NATO for Putin&rsquo;s illegal and horrifying war on Ukraine. Which on the face of it is bizarre, at best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that NATO&rsquo;s expansion over the last couple of decades was unwise. Yet who could blame small countries close to Russia from seeking the protection that membership brings? Putin&rsquo;s belligerence was well known even before the current attack.</p>
<p>George Monbiot makes the point well in his excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a strong argument that Nato should have been <a href="https://socialeurope.eu/what-is-nato-for">disbanded</a> at the end of the cold war. But while Putin’s sense of threat seems to have been heightened by Nato expansion and mission creep, Nato expansion has also been driven in part by Putin’s belligerence. Are we really to believe that Estonia and Latvia joined because they wanted to attack Russia? On the contrary, it’s because they fear attack. While Nato’s growth is likely to have contributed to the crisis, it’s ridiculous to suggest that Russia is not the aggressor.</p>
<p>&ndash; George Monbiot, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin">We must confront Russian propaganda – even when it comes from those we respect</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He suggests that Russian propaganda is at least partly to blame. It seems have made inroads on the left. Monbiot mentions the Stop the War Coalition, which normally we would think is an admirable goal and organisation. But their recent <a href="https://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/list-of-signatories-stop-the-war-statement-on-the-crisis-over-ukraine/">letter</a> claims the British government &lsquo;have poured oil on the fire throughout this episode.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m no supporter of Johnson or the Tories, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair. They also say that they &lsquo;do not endorse the nature or conduct of either the Russian or Ukrainian regimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the Ukrainians have done except prepare to defend themselves, and then do so. I&rsquo;m as against war as any former CND member from the eighties, but when a country is invaded, it has a right to fight back.</p>
<p>Monbiot says it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True anti-imperialism means opposing not only the west’s imperialism, essential as this is. It’s about opposing all imperialism, whether western, Russian, Chinese or other.</p>
<p>&ndash; George Monbiot, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin">As before</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As always, of course, it is the ordinary people who suffer. I recommend donating if you can, to one of the organisations working to help the people of Ukraine:</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever written about a book of poetry here before. That&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t read that much of it. Whenever I do, I think, &lsquo;I should read more poetry.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/the-kids-1277">This</a> won the Costa, but that&rsquo;s not the main reason I picked it up. The author, Hannah Lowe, was a tutor on my <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma">MA course</a>. She taught my Creative Nonfiction (CNF) module. Which sounds a long way from poetry, but a person can have skills in more than one type of writing. She was very good as a tutor, and in fact I got my highest single mark in CNF.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very short and easy read, but some of the poems go to some dark places. Others — most, I&rsquo;d say — are highly positive and life-affirming. They were inspired by her time teaching sixth formers in English schools. Which made me wonder on my CNF class chat, should we be worried about what her <em>next</em> collection&rsquo;s going to be about?</p>
<p>Hopefully she won&rsquo;t repeat herself. These are all sonnets, or in one cases a series of sonnets under one title, and very good, as the awards people clearly think.</p>

			 <p>Posting about books is slow because I&rsquo;m reading something gigantic. More of that later (possibly much later). But in the interstices, a return to <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/the-great-banksie-reread/">The Great Banksie Reread</a>). My friend <a href="https://buggerdefanoblog.wordpress.com">John</a> mentioned recently that he had just read this for the first time, which prompted me to revisit it (that, and perhaps some great whisky I got for Christmas).</p>
<p>Mildly surprised to realise that when I wrote about it before in <a href="https://devilgate.org/2003/12/22/the-whisky-post.html">The Whisky Post</a> it was not one of my typical book posts. I guess in 2003 I wasn&rsquo;t doing that. It was just over 18 years ago. Wow.</p>
<p>I concur with my earlier opinion, but note this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Banks gives us a brief overview of the steps in the distilling process, fairly early on, and then makes appropriate use of the various technical terms during later distillery visits. All fair enough. But there is one term for part of distillery’s apparatus — the <a href="http://www.whiskymag.com/words/lyne_arm.html">lyne arm</a> — that he starts referring to without ever explaining what it is (I’m fairly sure: it is possible that I just missed that explanation, but I don’t think so).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I offer an eighteen-year-late correction: he <em>does</em> define the <a href="https://scotchwhisky.com/magazine/ask-the-professor/19310/secrets-of-the-lyne-arm/">lyne arm</a> on first use. I must have missed it the first time. And I note with mild but resigned annoyance that the link in the quote above is dead, even though the site, <a href="https://whiskymag.com">Whisky Magazine</a>, is not.</p>
<p>Anyway, well worth a look if you haven&rsquo;t read it. You may not learn  <em>that</em> much about malts, and the scene has changed a lot over the time, but it&rsquo;s still a joy to spend time with him.</p>
<p>And it seems like Glenfiddich no longer make the Havana Reserve expression. If you search for it online there are prices quoted of around £400 a bottle(!), though no actual bottles for sale. Which is a shame, because it was good, and I&rsquo;m sure it would still sell if they made it. Maybe they stopped being able to get the rum barrels.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The first time I&rsquo;ve got it on the second line.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t blame Josh Wardle for making a ton of money out of it, it does perhaps slightly undercut the narrative over the last few weeks about how he did it for his partner and for fun. But like I say, who can blame him?</p>
<p>It does seem likely that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NYT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will put it behind their paywall eventually. As they did with the formerly-free review site <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/">The Wirecutter</a> when they bought it, for example. Which would be a shame.</p>
<p>Something I meant to write about before, but never got round to, was how all the mainstream press wrote about it. They made it hard to find, and, I think, helped to encourage the scammy app store rip-off versions. Because they (mostly, from what I saw) did not say that it was a web-based game, and worse, <em>they didn&rsquo;t link to it</em>. That&rsquo;s sloppy at best.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems I&rsquo;ve done it successfully for 21 days in a row:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turn_of_the_Screw">This extremely short book</a> is only a novella, but it took me some time to get through it because of the density and obscurity of the prose. James is, I think, notorious for writing long sentences, but that&rsquo;s only part of it. It&rsquo;s the textural density, the complexity, and, I think, the wilfully archaic (even for the time) formulations, that make it hard work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ghost story, though the status of the ghostly presences is disputed, or at least discussed: are they all in the governess&rsquo;s mind? The bulk of the tale is the first-person narrative of the governess, but it starts with an odd framing sequence of tales being told round a Christmas-eve fireplace. One of the company is reminded of a manuscript he has, and sends for it. The rest is him &lsquo;reading&rsquo; from it. And I&rsquo;m not sure that &lsquo;framing&rsquo; is the right term here, because we never return to the reading party. It seems like a device to let James write from the point of view of a woman.</p>
<p>Once you attune yourself to the style, it&rsquo;s pretty compelling. Chilling in places.</p>

			 <p>Ken <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/2021/12/beyond-hallowed-sky.html">posted about this on his blog</a>, along with a link to the <a href="https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/beyond-the-hallowed-sky/">first chapter on the publisher&rsquo;s site</a>. I read the chapter and instantly ordered the book from <a href="https://www.pagesofhackney.co.uk">my local bookshop</a>. Finished it on New Year&rsquo;s Day, so it counts as 2021.</p>
<p>He describes it as &lsquo;the first volume of the Lightspeed Trilogy&rsquo;, and adds that &lsquo;the second volume is well underway.&rsquo; Which is fine, but I usually make it a rule not to start unfinished serieses. So not so much a rule as a preference, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>This particular book ends in a way that is satisfactorily complete, but open enough for the followups to go in all sorts of directions. Plenty of unanswered questions, but none so burning that the wait should be annoying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s set in 2070, after that initial chapter which is three years earlier. Humanity is about to develop lightspeed travel. Or it already has. What intelligences will be waiting out there? Some people think the answer is &lsquo;none&rsquo;, because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">the Fermi Paradox</a>.</p>
<p>The political situation is interesting. The countries of the world have largely coalesced into three blocks: the Alliance, which is the Anglosphere minus Scotland and Ireland, but including India; the Union, which is most of Europe including Scotland and Ireland; and the Coordinated States, which is Russia and China. We don&rsquo;t hear anything about Africa or the Middle East. There has been (or is ongoing) an event called the Cold Revolution.</p>
<p>Also artificial intelligences are commonplace, including androids that are essentially indistinguishable from humans.</p>
<p>And if you need to build a starship, obviously you&rsquo;re going to add the FTL drive to a submarine. And where do you build such ships? On the Clyde, of course. A lot of this is set in places from my childhood, which is fun for me.</p>

<p>Happy New Year to one and all. Who knows what 2022 will bring, but let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s at least some relief from the difficulties of 2020 and 2021. But the coronavirus doesn&rsquo;t care about calendars, and neither does viral evolution.</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;re dealing with family photos back in the seventies, eighties, nineties, it&rsquo;s great that you write the date and place on the back (thanks, Mum). That&rsquo;s super useful. But could you please name the event and the <em>people</em>, too?</p>
<p>Yes, of course, you know what it was and who they were. But you&rsquo;re not writing it for you. You&rsquo;re writing it for your descendants, decades later, who want to know who these people were.</p>
<p>Why yes, I <em>am</em> scanning some old family photos, why do you ask?</p>
<p>Oh, and also: don&rsquo;t waste film on scenery. The Scottish hills and moors are lovely, but I&rsquo;m not interested in scanning old photos of them. Give me people, family, friends. Give me backgrounds, the wallpaper in the old house. Show me bookcases, wood-effect stereo systems. Old streets and shop signs.</p>
<p>And people, above all, people: that&rsquo;s what casual photography should be for.</p>
<p>You know what no one took pictures of in the film days? Food. I&rsquo;d actually love to see some old Sunday roasts or birthday cakes, but I don&rsquo;t suppose they&rsquo;d look that different from today&rsquo;s.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/12/28/planetfall-by-emma-newman-books/">Planetfall by Emma Newman (Books 2021, 27)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2021/12/28/planetfall-by-emma-newman-books/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-12-28 00:14:15 &#43;0000">Dec 28, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="http://www.enewman.co.uk/books-index/books/planetfall">This is a novel</a> about a human colony on an unnamed planet. There are, as we soon learn from the first-person narrator, Renata, lies and mysteries at the heart of the colony. Not least of those is how and why the humans came to live on this particular planet, in this particular place.</p>
<p>The place is at the foot of a mountain-like, biological, probably engineered structure they call the &lsquo;City of God&rsquo;. Twenty years ago — or more: the colony has existed for twenty years, but it&rsquo;s not clear how long the journey through space took — a small group of humans managed to get there in a spaceship. They were led by &lsquo;The Pathfinder&rsquo;, a woman who, we discover through flashbacks, knew what planet to head for because of a revelation she had had after ingesting the seed of a mysterious plant.</p>
<p>The intrigue of the novel is about how that backstory and the rest is filled in, how the colony keeps going, and what happens in the &lsquo;now&rsquo; of the story, when a mysterious human arrives.</p>
<p>How they designed and built a ship capable of getting there is not explained, and how far away from Earth it is is never stated. But I don&rsquo;t think Newman really understands the scales applicable to astronomical distances. On several occasions characters refer to having travelled (or in flashback, being about to travel) &lsquo;millions of miles&rsquo; to get to the new planet.</p>
<p>Our sun is 93 million miles from the Earth. If we&rsquo;re talking about distances that are sensibly expressed in terms of millions of miles, then we&rsquo;re talking about places <em>inside our own solar system</em>. And this is definitely not that.</p>
<p>Just to check, I asked Siri how far in miles it is to Alpha Centauri. It looked up <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=miles+to+alpha+centauri">Wolfram Alpha</a> and told me, &lsquo;About 25.8 trillion miles.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the closest star system to our own. It&rsquo;s not <em>wrong</em> to call that &lsquo;millions of miles&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s not exactly accurate. A trillion, after all, is a million million. And that&rsquo;s just the closest system.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t affect the story, but it&rsquo;s a weird thing for an SF writer to have missed, for no beta reader to have picked up, for an editor working at an SF publisher not to have caught.</p>
<p>Other than that, she does a great job of telling a first-person narrative from the point of view of someone who has some mental issues. All narrators are unreliable, and perhaps this one more so than usual. So we wonder how much we can rely on her telling of  what happens, especially at the end.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a religious background to this: the Pathfinder believed — and convinced those who came with her — that they would find God in the mysterious &lsquo;city&rsquo;. Did they? Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of a four-book series, which apparently can be read in any order. The next one (in terms of when they were written) looks like it takes place back on Earth, so we may learn nothing more about what happened in the colony, which was cut off from home.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/hench-natalie-zina-walschots?variant=33021717381154">The title comes from &lsquo;henchman&rsquo; — or -woman</a>. We are in a world where superheroes exist, and thereby, also super villains. Anna Tromedlov works as a &lsquo;hench&rsquo; — or tries to. As the novel starts she&rsquo;s using a temp agency, trying to pick up work.</p>
<p>At first it seems to be a comedy, but then she&rsquo;s at a press conference given by the villain she&rsquo;s working for, when the heroes arrive. Things get a lot darker.</p>
<p>Are superheroes, with their disregard for public safety, the real danger in a world like this? This novel takes a good look at that question, with accompanying adventure, threat, and romance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/19/failure-cascades/#natalie-zina-walschots">Cory Doctorow recommended it</a>.</p>
<p>If she didn&rsquo;t start out planning to call herself &lsquo;The Palindrome&rsquo;, would you ever think to read her surname backwards?</p>

<p>Four adult sisters are making their different ways in the world, but their mother disappeared a year ago. Ghosts and the spirits of stars sometimes wander the family home, where one of the sisters still lives, and the others come and go. A comet is due in the sky soon, and magic threats appear to be building.</p>
<p>Magic realism, you could call it, in the sense that it&rsquo;s set in the real worlds and magic is just <em>there</em>, for this family and a few other people at least. Everyday problems of relationships and such are part of it. The boyfriend of one of the sisters is a ghost.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it, and will probably read the sequel, which is out. My main problem with it was that the four sisters' voices weren&rsquo;t distinctive enough. The story is told from their multiple viewpoints. This is helpful to me, because it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m struggling with myself. Indeed, my <a href="/categories/cwma/">supervisor</a> suggested that maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have so many viewpoints.</p>
<p>Three. I have three. Hands up who thinks that&rsquo;s too many?</p>

			 <h1 id="on-what-a-song-is">On What a Song Is</h1>
<p>It seems like I’m increasingly often hearing people — especially, but not exclusively, Americans — referring to things as ‘songs’ that are not, in fact, songs.
{.has-dropcap}</p>
<p>For example, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does not have a theme song. Nor does <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eastenders<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — though long ago a song using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eastenders<!-- raw HTML omitted --> theme music made a dent in the UK charts.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Red Dwarf<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, to take two more science-fictional examples, <em>do</em> have theme songs.</p>
<p>Because here’s the truth of it: it’s not a song if it doesn’t have <em>words</em>. One or more human voices singing (because the verb <em>sing</em> goes with the noun <em>song</em>, obviously) is what is needed to make a piece of music into a song.</p>
<p>Those first examples above? Those are theme <em>tunes</em>. It’s not hard to understand the difference. For the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eastenders<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-based hit, somebody wrote words to go with the music; somebody <em>sang</em> it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of this as a recent thing, people referring as ‘songs’ to pieces of music without words. But I recalled why <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eastenders<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came to mind. Long ago in the distant past (the 80s) I had a housemate who had an American girlfriend. That programme came on the telly, and she said, ‘Oh, I love this song.’</p>
<p>Much more recently, on the <a href="https://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast (ATP)</a>, John Siracusa was trying to locate a beeping sound that something in his basement was making.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It was a series of electronic tones, played in a melodic fashion. a little tune, in other words. But he repeatedly referred to it as a ‘song’. Which it very definitely was not.</p>
<h1 id="other-takes">Other Takes</h1>
<p>I’m not saying there are no grey areas here. What about the voice used as an instrument, where it only makes wordless tones; mouth-music, as we used to call it? Or pieces that are largely instrumental, but have one vocal piece thrown in, like Glenn Miller’s ‘Pennsylvania 65000’, where the band stop playing at a couple of points and shout the title?
{.has-dropcap}</p>
<p>Or Mendelssohn has a series of pieces entitled ‘Songs Without Words’. What are those, then?</p>
<p>Birdsong, or whale songs? The clue there is in the adjectives, of course: just as nut milk is a milk-like drink made from the relevant nut (or similarly, oats, soya, etc), so birdsong is a song-like thing made by a bird.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m seeing this as mainly an American thing, let’s <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/song">consult America’s favourite dictionary, Merriam-Webster</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="definition-of-_song_-noun">Definition of <em>song</em> (noun)</h2>
<ol>
<li>the act or art of singing</li>
<li>poetical composition</li>
<li>a) a short musical composition of words and music<br>
b) a collection of such compositions</li>
<li>a distinctive or characteristic sound or series of sounds (as of a bird, insect, or whale)</li>
<li>a) a melody for a lyric poem or ballad<br>
b) a poem easily set to music</li>
<li>a) a habitual or characteristic manner<br>
b) a violent, abusive, or noisy reaction (put up quite a song)</li>
<li>a small amount (sold for a song)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>3a is the key one in my argument, clearly. 5a moves disturbingly in the opposite direction, since it refers to ‘a melody’. But since the melody is specifically ‘for a lyric poem or ballad’, the fundamental need for words still stands.</p>
<p>In the end, if it hasn&rsquo;t got words, it&rsquo;s not worth a song.</p>

			 <p>Just got my booster vaccination. I now have a dose of Moderna sloshing around my veins. So we&rsquo;ll see how that interacts with the <a href="/2021/03/18/astral-zen.html">previous</a> two Oxford-AstraZeneca <a href="/2021/06/03/vax.html">doses</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, we should be sending all this extra vaccine to poorer countries, because that would be the right thing to do, the moral thing. But even for self-preservation, we should be doing that. Every infected person is a mutation factory, so the fewer infected people there are in the world, the less chance there is of a mutation that&rsquo;s vaccine-resistant or worse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s self-preservation on a societal scale. But that same sense, at a personal level, lets me say, if they&rsquo;re offering it here, I&rsquo;m going to take it.</p>

A few paragraphs in I realised that I wanted to read the book, and the article was heading deep into spoiler territory. So I stopped reading it and downloaded the book. Read it as soon as I finished <a href="/blog/2021/11/26/the-caledonian-gambit-by-dan-moren-books-2021-23/">the last one</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the story of four neglected sisters, whose parents run a boys' boarding school and have no time for anything else, including their daughters; and of a ghost that is haunting them, and who might be one of them. And of an ancient darkness that the sisters accidentally invoked.</p>
<p>But the real darkness is the neglect.</p>

			 <p>Dan Moren writes about Apple stuff over at <a href="https://sixcolors.com/about/">Six Colours</a>, and at <a href="https://www.macworld.com"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Macworld<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> and so on, but he&rsquo;s also an SF writer. This is his first novel, and there are already a couple of sequels. The series is described as &lsquo;The Galactic Cold War,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s a pretty good description.</p>
<p>There are several planets, linked by wormholes. From what I can tell, they&rsquo;re all originally Earth colonies, but there is at least one empire and one commonwealth, and Earth itself has been conquered by the empire. No aliens, at least so far.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good, in an &lsquo;SF meets cold-war thriller&rsquo; kind of way. There&rsquo;s nothing groundbreaking, but a set of characters I wouldn&rsquo;t mind spending more time with, and an intersting situation.</p>
<p>What struck me, as a Scot, was the &lsquo;Caledonian&rsquo; part. Moren is American, but he spent some time in Scotland. Caledonia is the name of one of the colony planets &ndash; predictably, the one where most of the action happens. Part of its capital city is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leith">Leith</a>. Just down the coast there&rsquo;s Berwick.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Various other towns or areas have names drawn from Scotland. It has moons called Skye and Aran. A group of terrorists or freedom fighters are called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Watch">Black Watch</a> &ndash; though slightly oddly their leader is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89amon_de_Valera">De Valera</a>.</p>

			 <p>We subscribed to Disney+ last night, so that we could watch Peter Jackson&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Beatles: Get Back<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I had thought it was going to be a movie, but it turns out it&rsquo;s a miniseries: three two-hour episodes. The second drops today, and the third tomorrow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built from hours of footage that were recorded for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let It Be<!-- raw HTML omitted --> documentary back in 1969. I remember watching that once and being disappointed by it. The main problem was that it was presented as a fly-on-the-wall thing, but the fly was aurally challenged.</p>
<p>In other words, you couldn&rsquo;t make out much of the chatter between the guys. That, almost as much as hearing them rehearsing and working on the songs, was kind of the point.</p>
<p>If you were making a documentary like that today you&rsquo;d probably have all the band members wearing microphone packs, as the participants in reality TV shows do, so that what they said would make it to storage. Back then, though, even if that had been practical,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> it was far from obvious that the individual Beatles would all have complied. Plus we&rsquo;d want to hear from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Epstein">Brian</a>,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Evans">Mal</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyn_Johns">Glyn</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin">the other George</a>, as well as John, Paul, George, and Ringo.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of microphone packs. So of course, the original producers relied on ambient miking. It&rsquo;s fine when the speaker is near one of the vocal mics, or when they&rsquo;re right under a boom, but otherwise… well, as I say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let It Be<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was a frustrating experience.</p>
<p>However, technology has come a long, long, way in the succeeding fifty years. Every word in this is clear as a bell,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> undoubtedly with the help of modern digital audio editing. It&rsquo;s slightly ironic to note that one of the first things the band say is that the place they&rsquo;re working in &ndash; a warehouse in Twickenham &ndash; is acoustically bad. An odd choice of a place in which to work on writing and performing songs.</p>
<p>Anyway, as of the cliffhanger ending of episode one, this series is <em>fucking amazing</em>! Totally brilliant!</p>
<p>But only if you&rsquo;re a fan. If you only take a passing interest in The Beatles, or (weirdly) none at all, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t waste your time on this.</p>
<h2 id="the-disneyfication-of-christmas">The Disneyfication of Christmas</h2>
<p>Disney have made a genius move in launching this when they did. We will be far, far, from the only people who took out a subscription to watch this, with the intention of cancelling it after a month.</p>
<p>A month. What&rsquo;s a month after yesterday, the 25th of November? Oh yes.</p>
<p>All those subscriptions that are due to renew on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day? So many of them won&rsquo;t be cancelled, either just to have things to watch over Christmas, or to keep the kids happy, or because people will forget with everything else going on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll probably try to catch up on some of the newer Marvel and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stuff, of which there is just far, far, too much now, in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not too much Beatles.</p>

			 <p>I was surprised just over three weeks ago when I learned &ndash; from the Saturday <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the physical newspaper, of all things &ndash; that <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was staring the next day. I was aware it was going to be happening this autumn, certainly, but somehow I&rsquo;d missed any hype about it online.</p>
<p>I was perhaps more surprised to learn that it was going to be a single story. Surprised, and pleased: a six-parter, just like the old days, like the ones I grew up with. Of course, back then you&rsquo;d get a few four-parters and maybe a six, all across what felt like many weeks. In this case, the six parts will make up the whole season. But still. There would be cliffhangers.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re three weeks in, halfway through.</p>
<p>There are cliffhangers. So many cliffhangers. Cliffs hung so thoroughly that the metaphor breaks down. The whole thing even started with The Doctor and Yaz hanging upside down. Not from a cliff, but still.</p>
<p>Hang those cliffs. The angels have the blue box.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> No, wait, that&rsquo;s for later. Or earlier. This time haze is getting to me.</p>
<p>This season, series, story, whatever you want to call it, is incredible. I am loving it. If they can hold up this quality, and especially give it a good ending &ndash; stick the landing, as people say for some (I believe <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/stick+the+landing">gymnastics-related</a>) reason &ndash; then it could be the high-water mark of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And even if they don&rsquo;t manage a great ending, the ride will have been worthwhile.</p>
<p>But I want to get something out there before we get too much further into the series, and <strong>spoilers ahead</strong>, probably, so stop reading if you haven&rsquo;t seen at least up to episode 3, &lsquo;Once, Upon Time.&rsquo; Also if you think speculations can be spoilers. I, personally, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>OK, so, we&rsquo;ve seen glimpses of the Weeping Angels in these episodes. These creatures feed on time energy, and in this story, time energy is going wild, has been unleashed in dangerous ways. Whatever all that means (&lsquo;Time is evil,&rsquo; as one of the priest-triangles said).</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re seeing the origin of the Weeping Angels. Or we&rsquo;re going to see it. Something that happens in this story will bring the Angels into being. No idea what, mind you. I thought the Mouri in the Temple of Atropos might end up turning into them, but I think we&rsquo;ve moved away from there now.</p>
<p>Anyway, all is well in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-land.</p>

			 <p>Talk about not remembering books: I&rsquo;ve got to ask myself whether I ever <em>did</em> read this one. I remembered one thing from it, but it&rsquo;s not how I remembered it. When people jack in to the matrix they use headsets &ndash; &lsquo;trodes&rsquo; &ndash;  with electrodes that connect to their temples.</p>
<p>There is a transition between the real world and cyberspace when they connect, and I had this memory of one cowboy (people who enter the matrix or cyberspace are called &lsquo;cowboys&rsquo; or &lsquo;jockeys&rsquo;) who had a set of trodes that made the transition feel like the world was falling apart. I&rsquo;ve been half waiting for that bit through these three books. Here&rsquo;s a quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Ready?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, and Tick&rsquo;s room was gone, its walls a flutter of cards, tumbling and receding, against the bright grid, the towering forms of data.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nice transition, that,&rsquo; she heard him say. &lsquo;Built into the trodes, that is. Bit of drama…&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that must be the bit I remembered, but if you had asked me I&rsquo;d have said I thought it came <a href="/blog/2021/10/30/count-zero-by-william-gibson-books-2021-21/">a book</a> or <a href="/blog/2021/10/13/neuromancer-by-william-gibson-books-2021-20/">two</a> earlier, and was mentioned more than once.</p>
<p>But what of the book itself? It keeps up the standard, maybe raises it slightly. We have four interconnected stories, four viewpoint characters, told in alternating chapters. One of the stories &ndash; that of Kumiko, who is experiencing the flutter of cards, above &ndash; isn&rsquo;t really relevant, in the sense that it doesn&rsquo;t drive the plot at all. Things that happen around her do affect the main plot, but she&rsquo;s not really aware of them.</p>
<p>What surprised me about this and the three books overall, is how much they really are a trilogy. I had the impression that they were considered only to be very loosely connected at best; essentially three stories set in the same <em>milieu</em>. But in fact not only do characters recur, everything here ties back to the events of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neuromancer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which happened some fourteen years before.</p>
<p>All very worth reading if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>

			 <p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard a song off an album &ndash; you&rsquo;ve heard the album, maybe a few times, but it&rsquo;s just kind of washed over you, not really made much of an impression &ndash; you hear a song, maybe on the radio, maybe some random or curated playlist, and you go. &lsquo;Wow! What a great song!&rsquo; And then you realise it&rsquo;s from <em>that</em> album, the one that washed over you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what singles were for. Still are for, since they&rsquo;re still released, though it&rsquo;s not quite the same.</p>
<p>I just had that experience with Radiohead. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kid A<!-- raw HTML omitted --> never made much of an impact on me, but when I turned <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_6music">BBC 6 Music</a> on tonight, a killer track was playing.  <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0072lb2">Steve Lamacq</a> back-announced it. He was playing the whole album, and the track was &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/i/1097863241">The National Anthem</a>.&rsquo; I knew <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kid A<!-- raw HTML omitted --> had a track of that name, but it had never really got to me. But there, now, tonight, it was just amazing.</p>
<p>A similar, if inverted, effect is when the album is <em>so good</em> that it kind of drowns out a brillant single. I can only think of one example of that at the moment. If you cast your mind back (assuming it goes that far) to when The Jam released &lsquo;<a href="https://song.link/i/1442461346">The Eton Rifles</a>,&rsquo; it was an incredible song.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://album.link/i/1442461170"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Setting Sons<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> is such a good album that I hardly notice &lsquo;The Eton Rifles&rsquo; on it.</p>
<p>Anyway. Singles. Yes.</p>

			 <p>I have a 15-inch MacBook Pro from 2017. It&rsquo;s in perfect working order, except the battery was past its best. &lsquo;Service recommended,&rsquo; it always said when I checked. But it was fine, I could get a couple of hours out of it, and I rarely use the computer away from somewhere I can plug in. Especially this last couple of years.</p>
<p>But the screen had developed a problem. There were marks on it that I couldn&rsquo;t remove. They were kind of hard to photograph, but you can see them here:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I discovered there was a known defect in models of that era called &lsquo;screen delamination.&rsquo; The top layer of the screen&rsquo;s coating was becoming detached from the underlying one.</p>
<p>People had solutions, which involved careful cleaning with various solvents or mild abrasives: isopropyl alcohol, or, I don&rsquo;t know, toothpaste, maybe.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Inevitably, the whole affair has a &lsquo;gate&rsquo; name: <a href="https://boncode.hk/hk/blog/staingate/">Staingate</a>. Perhaps less inevitably, but unsurprisingly since it&rsquo;s a manufacturing defect, Apple have long since acknowledged the problem and offered a free repair programme. As long as your machine was no more than four years old.</p>
<p>I discovered these facts back in the summer. Dug out my receipt. I bought the laptop four years and four days ago. Damn!</p>
<p>At the time I was deep in working towards <a href="/blog/2021/09/17/dissertation-submitted/">my dissertation</a>, so I wasn&rsquo;t going to spend any more time on it. In September, though, I thought it would be worth contacting Apple support and seeing what could be done. I couldn&rsquo;t get a Genius Bar appointment, but I could take it to an Apple Authorised Service Provider called <a href="https://mrsystems.co.uk/pages/contact">MR in Shoreditch</a>. They had a look at it and said, yes it&rsquo;s the delamination thing, you&rsquo;re outside the free programme, we can fix it: 800 quid.</p>
<p>Too much. But! they also said that it would be worth taking it in to Apple. They might, depending on who you saw, do it for free anyway.</p>
<p>I was slightly sceptical, and we were getting ready for a trip to Scotland at the time, so I left it. Eventually, though, I booked it into the Genius Bar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re outside the programme, they said. But we&rsquo;ll fix it under consumer law. No charge.</p>
<p>The Sale of Goods Act (or its successors) for the win again: a laptop screen should last longer than four years.</p>
<p>During the tests they run, the guy noticed that the battery was poorly, and offered a replacement. £199 seems steep, so I said no thanks.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got an email to say it was ready to pick up, so I toddled off to Westfield. The staff member who brought it out to me asked me to wait while she checked something. Came back and said, &lsquo;You know how you rejected the battery replacement? Well it seems they did it anyway. We won&rsquo;t charge you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So that was weird. The work note that came with it said &lsquo;Battery won&rsquo;t charge at all,&rsquo; which was not true when I took it in. But here I am with a good-as-new battery. Well, <em>actually</em> new.</p>
<p>All of this required what they call a &lsquo;Top case replacement.&rsquo; &lsquo;Top case with battery,&rsquo; in fact, which suggests the battery is in the screen part of the laptop, not the keyboard part, which seems weird.</p>
<p>The big downside &ndash; but one that had been prepared for &ndash; is that I lost all my stickers. I had heard of this kind of thing happening, so I took photographs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The questions now are how and whether to replace them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also not as good as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neuromancer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by a long shot. Difficult second album syndrome, I&rsquo;d imagine. It came out a year or two later.

<p>My initial thought was just to log the films that I watched, as an <em>aide memoire</em> as much as anything. But Letterboxd encourages you to give the films star ratings. I’ve been doing that, but all the time I wonder what exactly I mean by them.</p>
<p>Which sounds like a strange thing to say. I made the choices, after all: I set the rating. Surely I knew what I meant when I did it?</p>
<p>And that’s true enough on each occasion. I know what I mean when I give the rating. But that’s the thing: it’s what I meant <em>at that time</em>. All it means is what I thought of the the film at the time I added the entry to Letterboxd. I’m not trying to make a statement about what is <em>good</em> in absolute terms. I’m just saying something about what I thought about the film at that time.</p>
<p>I like to think that I judge each film on its own merits. At the very least, I try to judge it in terms of what it&rsquo;s trying to achieve. A five-star drama and a five-star comedy are very different things. It won’t be very meaningful to compare the ratings I’ve given to different films and see if there’s a hierarchy of my preferences. Though it is fair to say that any film with five stars is one of my favourites.</p>
<p>While Letterboxd encourages star ratings, it pleases me that you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to give one. Unlike, say in some online surveys, where zero is not an option. I don&rsquo;t know, though, whether a Letterboxd &lsquo;no stars&rsquo; should count as &lsquo;zero stars,&rsquo; or just the choice not to rate it. I intended the latter <a href="/blog/letterboxd/cant-get-you-out-of-my-head-2021/">with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Can&rsquo;t Get You Out of my Head<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>, as I made clear in the post.</p>
<p>It seems that I rarely watch anything less than three-star, though. Either I&rsquo;m very discerning, or I only watch things I know I&rsquo;m going to like.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m on a bit of a reread thing at the moment, partly because I moved some books around recently, which revealed some older ones.</p>
<p>This is another one that stands up really well. It has some amusing out-of-time moments, like &lsquo;three megabytes of hot RAM&rsquo;: imagine having that much computer memory! And the well-known geostationary satellite over Manhattan impossibility.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But we don&rsquo;t let those things bother us.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is just how much it influenced <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Matrix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It was always fairly obvious that the Wachowskis named their virtual world after Gibson&rsquo;s cyberspace, though <a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/The_Matrix"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> got there first</a>, and possibly others did too. But there&rsquo;s a scene in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neuromancer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where Case sees drifting lines of code overlaid on the reality that he&rsquo;s perceiving. Very much seems the inspiration for Neo seeing the Matrix.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s still a fine story, with some striking prose.</p>

			 <p>You wait years for a beloved three-letter-creator to return to a beloved SF show, and then two happen in one week. After <a href="/blog/2021/09/24/rustys-return/">the news</a> of RTD returning to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we have… <a href="http://www.jmsnews.com">JMS</a> returning to &ndash; and <a href="https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/1442621159221043202">rebooting &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Babylon 5<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>?</p>
<p>I did not see that coming. And I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how I feel about it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Babylon 5<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>was among my favourite programmes of the nineties. It was groundbreaking, in that it was probably the first such show to be planned from the start as a single long (five year) story. With many sub-stories and side plots along the way, as you might imagine.</p>
<p>It was, of course, flawed, especially in the rushed completion of season 4. They thought they were going to be cancelled, so JMS tried to tie up most of the loose ends in that season. Then season 5 was saved, and ended up being slow and underpowered by comparison.</p>
<p>For this proposed reboot &ndash; it&rsquo;s TV, so nothing is definite till it&rsquo;s in the can &ndash; he says he will &lsquo;not be retelling the same story in the same way because of what Heraclitus said about the river&rsquo;, but that &lsquo;this is a reboot from the ground up rather than a continuation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If anyone else was running it, you could count me out. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski">Straczynski</a> <em>could</em> make it great again, but I sort of wonder why he wants to. Not unlike my wondering about why RTD wants to return to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I suppose we&rsquo;re never entirely satisfied with our creations, so getting the opportunity to go back and rework them can be tempting. But I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s always healthy.</p>
<p>Still, we live in hope.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanark:_A_Life_in_Four_Books">this</a> a long time ago, and the strange thing now is that everything I remembered of it happens in the first two books: that is, in Book 3 and Book 1. As I&rsquo;m sure you know, the internal books are ordered 3, 1, 2, 4.</p>
<p>Which sort of suggests that I didn&rsquo;t finish it all those years ago, but I&rsquo;m sure that isn&rsquo;t the case. There were odd moments of the slightest sense of the familiar in the other books, so I guess it&rsquo;s just vagaries.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was and remains a monumental work. It struck me as odd that the blurb describes it as &lsquo;a modern vision of hell.&rsquo; I had never thought of it in those terms. True, Lanark&rsquo;s situation is dark, difficult, and confusing, and he can be seen as Thaw after death, if Thaw dies at the end of Book 2, which seems likely. But hell? That seems extreme. Lanark has difficulties, but he&rsquo;s not in a state of eternal torment.</p>
<p>He is, however, quite a frustrating character. He is thrown into a situation &ndash; several situations &ndash; where he doesn&rsquo;t understand what is going on, or how the world works; and for the most part he doesn&rsquo;t ask even the most obvious questions, or make any attempt to gain understanding. So he&rsquo;s not so much protagonist as a character being pushed around by circumstance. Or by his author, whom we meet in the fourth-wall-destroying epilogue towards the end of the book.</p>
<p>Much more obviously, Lanark&rsquo;s experiences in Unthank and beyond are a satire of late-stage capitalism. Which you could say is a form of hell, so maybe that&rsquo;s what the blurb writer was getting at.</p>

			 <p>Well <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/24/russell-t-davies-to-return-to-doctor-who-as-showrunner">that</a> answers <a href="/blog/2021/07/29/whos-next/">the question I asked in July</a>. At least the bit I described as &lsquo;arguably more important&rsquo;. Russell T Davies is going to be the new showrunner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting decision, and one I have mixed feelings about. At his best he was great, and some of the things he&rsquo;s done since have been stellar. And I&rsquo;m astonished to find that I&rsquo;ve never mentioned either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_and_Years_(TV_series)"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Years and Years<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_and_Years_(TV_series)"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s a Sin<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> here. Not least because I can remember recommending at least one of them online. Maybe it was just on Twitter, but I don&rsquo;t originate many tweets there. Nearly everything that isn&rsquo;t a reply comes from here.</p>
<p>Anyway, the great RTD is coming back, like <a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/The_456">the 456 in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Torchwood<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>. And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be great. I just think it&rsquo;s kind of sad if the BBC couldn&rsquo;t find someone new to take over. There must be plenty of people willing to take it on. Both willing and capable? That&rsquo;s another question. But hell, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski">JMS</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> offered. He&rsquo;s certainly capable, and it would have been amazing.</p>
<p>Also it&rsquo;s a shame that RTD won&rsquo;t get to work with Jodie Whittaker, because I think that could&rsquo;ve been quite a combo.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the reaction on much of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-related Twitter, which seems to be, &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is saved!&rsquo; When it doesn&rsquo;t need saving due to having been really good for the last season and pretty good the season before that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be fun.</p>

			 <p>Dave Winer may be a very smart guy, who effectively invented blogging, RSS, and podcasts, but he&rsquo;s lost his mind in this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are now all complete newbies when it comes to understanding how networks can be used to spread misinformation. We might look back in a few years and realize that our first line of defense was Facebook, Inc. Maybe tearing them down is like the press tearing down HRC in 2016. I don&rsquo;t trust their judgement on this stuff, do you?</p>
<p>&ndash; Dave Winer, <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/22.html#a145852">Untitled Scripting News post</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first sentence is fair enough, but the second? Facebook is the first line of <em>attack</em>, rather, on our democratic freedoms. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica">Cambridge Analytica</a> stories, <em>passim</em>. Or if not the <em>first</em>, then the most powerful tool in the armoury of the anti-democratic forces that plague us.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;them&rsquo; he refers to is, I think, journalists. Or &lsquo;journalism,&rsquo; as a collective entity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I judge journalism in the aggregate.</p>
<p>In other words, I say &ldquo;journalism&rdquo; did this or that.</p>

			 <p>It was strangely timely that I decided to start reading this a few days before the 9/11 anniversary, since it concerns a man&rsquo;s obsession with what happened on 9/11. The narrator is a journalist who lost his partner in the attacks. Except her name doesn&rsquo;t appear on any passenger manifest, and there are multiple mysteries around the whole event.</p>
<p>As there are in real life. But this story takes place in a slightly altered reality. Scotland already has its independence, and England &ndash; or at least the little we see of London &ndash; has become increasingly dystopian, plagued by militarised police and surveillance.</p>
<p>The action switches back and forth in location between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Bute">the Isle of Bute</a> (where Priest also lives) and various parts of the USA (and sometimes those places are oddly coterminous). And also jumps around in time, from the present of the story &ndash; roughly 2017-8, when it was written and published &ndash; to before and during the 11th of September 2001, to various points between the two. It even dips a few years into the future.</p>
<p>It touches on ideas and discussions that are considered the domain of conspiracy theories, but largely avoids going down those rabbit holes. As <a href="https://omnibus.home.blog/2021/05/01/an-american-story-by-christopher-priest-review/">one review</a> I read said, &lsquo;Conspiracy theories purport answers, often paranoid and outlandish; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->An American Story<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is about <em>questions</em>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well worth a read, though there a couple of threads that he starts and leaves hanging, that I think would have been interesting to follow.</p>

			 <p>My dissertation is due in just under a week. I&rsquo;m seeking an extension, because I&rsquo;ve been a bit poorly and have lost a lot of work time over the last week, but I still hope to get it in on time.</p>
<p>But that will mean my <a href="link://category/cwma">course</a> will be over. Which is a little bit saddening. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed being a student again, even though this academic year&rsquo;s particular situation has meant that the experience has been distinctly unlike a classic student one. Even, I&rsquo;m sure, for Birkbeck, &lsquo;London&rsquo;s evening university.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have, for example, met none of my classmates in person. I&rsquo;ve met exactly one member of staff, and that in the park in <a href="https://london.ac.uk/about-us/history-university-london/gordon-square">Gordon Square</a>. I&rsquo;ve never been in the department&rsquo;s building. I&rsquo;ve been into any Birkbeck building &ndash; the library &ndash; I think three times, maybe four.</p>
<p>Online classes have been fine, though. I wonder if creative writing, in its common workshopping format, works especially well over Teams or Zoom. Everyone takes turns to comment on the piece that&rsquo;s being discussed, and there&rsquo;s much less scope for interruptions, compared to in person. Of course the downside of that is that there&rsquo;s less scope for conversation, for organic discussion. So we probably lost out in some ways, too.</p>
<p>Less, though, than students on other courses, and especially first year undergraduates. Like my daughter, who has done a year of uni and met practically no one on her course. It&rsquo;s a strange state of affairs, to be sure.</p>
<p>But we move on. This novel extract isn&rsquo;t going to dissert itself.</p>

			 <p>The absence of an apostrophe in the title has disturbed me slightly since I heard of this book. I think I concluded that it was meant as a verbal statement: rainbows <em>do</em> end, after all. The fact that the last chapter is entitled, &lsquo;The Missing Apostrophe&rsquo; comforts me.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/tag/vernor-vinge/">The other Vinge books that I&rsquo;ve read</a> (which would appear from that to only be one, but that is misleading) are galaxy-spanning space operas. This, in contrast, is very compact in scale, being set almost entirely in San Diego, and on the net.

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good, but 2025, the year in which it is set, feels pretty close now. I guess it didn&rsquo;t in 2006.</p>

			 <p>I actually read this before the <a href="/blog/2021/08/21/whit-by-iain-banks-books-2021-15/">previous one</a>, but forget to write about it. Perhaps that&rsquo;s because I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it very much.</p>
<p>Jack Vance is considered one of the greats of SF, and I realised recently that I hadn&rsquo;t read anything by him. And I had this big volume that Gollancz gave away at a convention some time, containing this and two other books (another novel and a collection of short stories). A sort of literary compilation album.</p>
<p>But not a Greatest Hits — or if it is, then things are pretty bad.</p>
<p>The main problem is that it&rsquo;s dated. Usually we can work around that sort of thing, and I did — look at me, all finished with it — but the main thing here is that it&rsquo;s just badly written. Cardboard characters, dodgy sexual politics, and a plot that, while interesting enough to get me through it, is far too easily resolved.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the background of an Earth empire or federation or similar, that we see essentially notthing of. Instead the action is all confined to the eponymous planet. It &lsquo;revolutionised the <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/planetary_romance">planetary romance</a>,&rsquo; according to the blurb. And, indeed it was important to the form according to the linked SF Encyclopedia entry.</p>
<p>So much for that. All I can say is, it didn&rsquo;t do a lot for me.</p>

			 <p>The human memory is an amazing thing. In this case, it&rsquo;s amazing what it&rsquo;s possible <em>not</em> to remember.</p>
<p>To wit: I remembered almost completely nothing about this book. That the main character was part of an odd religious community based near Stirling in Scotland; and that she had to make a trip to London by slightly unusual means to track down a musical and possibly apostate cousin: that&rsquo;s as far as my memory went.</p>
<p>It came out in 1995, so twenty-six years have passed since I first read it. I would have said that I had reread it once, which you would hope might lock things down a bit in the brain. But on the plus side, it meant it was almost like reading a new Iain Banks book, so in that way the forgetting was good.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;d expect, a great deal more happens than what I remembered. It&rsquo;s another family drama, in the vein of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Crow Road<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and <a href="/blog/2007/09/20/the-steep-approach-to-garbadale-by-iain-banks-books-2007-4/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Steep Approach to Garbadale<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>.

			 <p>I realised the other day that it&rsquo;s a year ago that I was applying for creative writing MAs, before <a href="/blog/2020/09/16/how-im-going-to-master-this-writing-lark/">being accepted on and choosing the one at Birkbeck</a>.</p>
<p>Well that went fast.</p>
<p>2021 feels like it&rsquo;s being disappearing even faster than 2020 did, which is strange. Or maybe not. The pandemic is far from  over, of course, many things are still up in the air, and it could all change again in an instant.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been lax in reporting on what&rsquo;s been going on with <a href="/categories/cwma/">the course</a> . The summer term was all an optional lecture series, which largely consisted of members of staff interviewing writers, along with one or two pieces about the craft of writing. One on the structure of the novel, and one a session with some agents.</p>
<p>That last one probably had the most practical value &ndash; at least potentially &ndash; but they were all interesting.</p>
<p>Other than that, My dissertation is due in a month. Actually now just under four weeks. It consists of 15,000 words of creative writing (plus or minus 10%, so up to 16,500), plus a 3000-word preface (also plus or minus 10%). I have 23,000 words, of which I can&rsquo;t use the first five or six thousand, because I already submitted them for an earlier assessment. So there&rsquo;s plenty to work with.</p>
<p>It feels a little odd to have paused the forward flow &ndash; I intend this to be a novel, after all &ndash; to work on editing what I have so far. But it ought to be worthwhile for the novel, as well as being necessary for my dissertation. This period of working over what I&rsquo;ve already done should give me a firmer base on which to build the rest.</p>
<p>I think I miss classes. I only had two a week for the first two terms, and a slightly more erratic schedule averaging to one a week for the third, but they provided structure, as well as a feeling of connection with others on the course. So I&rsquo;m looking forward to an informal workshop session some of us have arranged for this week.</p>
<p>But beyond that, the future. What&rsquo;s next?</p>

			 <p>Another one suggested by <a href="link://category/cwma">my supervisor</a>. It&rsquo;s about a band, and the novel I&rsquo;m working on involves a couple of bands. And it&rsquo;s also a multiple viewpoint third-person narrative, as is mine.</p>
<p>Like <a href="/blog/2021/07/08/summerwater-by-sarah-moss-books-2021-11/">the last such</a>, it handles the multiple viewpoints in quite an extreme way. There are four band members, and a quarter of the book is told from the point of view of each. Four chapters, no returning once one PoV is finished with.</p>
<p>The title is the name of the band, and their schtick is that they are all exes of someone else in the band (in practice, it&rsquo;s two former couples, but there&rsquo;s obviously a certain amount of will they/won&rsquo;t they about any other possible hookings up).</p>
<p>So really it&rsquo;s about the relationships, and how each person handles the pressure-cooker of being in a band together, touring, all that. Along with a fair chunk of backstory for each.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s set in Boston (and a few other places) in the early to mid nineties. The ending is &ndash; open, let&rsquo;s say, but not in annoying way. In fact, it&rsquo;s quite satisfying, though I could happily have read more.</p>

			 <p>Sorry, that&rsquo;s, like, the most obvious title in known space. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57940451">Jodie and Chris are leaving <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> after the next series and specials. Late 2022, that is.</p>
<p>That BBC News report is almost comically self-flagellatory. After quoting Jodie Whittaker&rsquo;s hugely positive statements about the show, they say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While many have praised Whittaker&rsquo;s casting, some fans and critics have criticised the show&rsquo;s recent narrative direction.</p>
<p>The Telegraph described recent episodes as &ldquo;flat, worthy and woke&rdquo; despite Whittaker&rsquo;s talent as an actress, while The Sun reported viewers were left furious by the show&rsquo;s &ldquo;unbearable political correctness&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ndash; Uncredited BBC reporter, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57940451">Doctor Who: Jodie Whittaker and Chris Chibnall to leave in 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If <em>those</em> publications are making <em>those</em> criticisms, I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s a big win. Stop beating yourself up, the BBC. The programme is and remains a success, the jewel in the BBC&rsquo;s crown.</p>
<p>Significantly further down the report they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Episodes such as Rosa, Demons of the Punjab and Spyfall thrilled audiences, and netted the show two Bafta Must See Moment nominations, along with multiple National Television Award, Bafta Cymru, TV Choice and Critics Choice nominations.</p>
<p>In 2020, Whittaker was voted second most popular Doctor of all-time in a poll of 50,000 fans for the Radio Times, losing out to David Tennant.</p>
<p>&ndash; As before, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57940451">Doctor Who: Jodie Whittaker and Chris Chibnall to leave in 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you go. Now: who&rsquo;s going to the the next Doctor? And &ndash; arguably more importantly &ndash; who&rsquo;s going to be the next head writer?</p>
<p>Or will they just put the show on ice for a few years? I read a piece recently that suggested that&rsquo;s what it needs to revitalise itself, citing the gap from 1989 to 2005 as the model.</p>
<p>I hope they don&rsquo;t do that. In fact, if it needs revitalisation at all, then last season&rsquo;s big revelations about the Doctor&rsquo;s origins are just what they need for that. You could, for example, have a season or two of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Martin">Jo Martin&rsquo;s</a> Doctor. She&rsquo;d be great, though such a move would confuse people, since it would be in the past of the Doctor we know.</p>
<p>We can only look forward to finding out.</p>

			 <p>In <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2021/07/28/dragonflies-and-the-twisties/">Dragonflies and The Twisties</a>, Austin Kleon writes about dragonflies.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> He links to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/07/02/for-dragonflies-a-place-to-rest-their-wings/20a491da-cd55-4263-8736-1db486dccc51/">Washington Post article from 1989 by Henry Mitchell</a>. It&rsquo;s about gardening, and it contains the wonderful line (of the insects in question), &lsquo;They are nothing but good and fair, a sufficient reason for summer to exist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I was in the sitting room with the window open the other day, and one flew in. I&rsquo;ve only seen them very occasionally in the wild, skimming along above a river or pond. I&rsquo;ve always found them slightly disturbing, because they&rsquo;re so big for an insect. It&rsquo;s an echo of the utter revulsion I remember feeling in a biology lab back in my schooldays, where there were stick insects. Some people were happy to take them out and hold them, but I could barely stay in the room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s borderline phobic, I realise: stick insects don&rsquo;t even <em>do</em> anything, they just sit there being camouflaged and inoffensive. But there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about that kind of gut reaction.</p>
<p>Except maybe allow time to pass. Back in the sitting room with the visiting dragonfly, I was surprised, but felt more fascination than revulsion. I closed the door so it wouldn&rsquo;t go further into the house, opened the window wide, and waited to see if it would go out. There wasn&rsquo;t much else I could do: even if it settled, it was much too big to catch under a glass to release outside, as I would a spider.</p>
<p>The pattern of its flight was strange and erratic-seeming. Very different from the flies, wasps, and moths that much more commonly come into houses. Something to do with those double wings and that long tail, maybe. It pootled around, approached the window a couple of times, without going for the open part, but didn&rsquo;t bang itself against the glass as the smaller visitors do.</p>
<p>Once it rested up on the plaster moulding near the ceiling.</p>
<p>Eventually it flew towards the window again, found the opening, and was gone. It&rsquo;s a short walk, and a shorter flight, down to the River Lea, its likely habitat round these parts. But I wonder what brought it all the way up here.</p>
<p>And now looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly">the Wikipedia article</a>, I wonder if it was actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damselfly">damselfly</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dragonflies can be mistaken for the related group, damselflies (Zygoptera), which are similar in structure, though usually lighter in build; however, the wings of most dragonflies are held flat and away from the body, while damselflies hold their wings folded at rest, along or above the abdomen. Dragonflies are agile fliers, while damselflies have a weaker, fluttery flight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how it held its wings when it rested, but that &lsquo;weaker, fluttery flight&rsquo; does sound more like my interesting summer visitor.</p>

			 <p>Just last month I wrote <a href="/blog/2021/06/08/single-points/">Single Points</a>, about the Fastly CDN outage. This morning many, many sites were down or inaccessible because of an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/07/22/internet-outage-amazon-airbnb-delta/">outage at Akamai</a>. A content delivery network again, though they&rsquo;re saying the outage is caused by &lsquo;edge DNS.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m familiar with DNS, but not the &lsquo;edge&rsquo; variant. In fact, I realise it&rsquo;s capitalised and is the name of an Akamai product or service.</p>
<p>More evidence that the increasing centralisation of internet services is a problem. On the plus side, it was resolved quickly. When a service provider has the kind of major clients we&rsquo;re talking about here, then that company is going to have to be able to respond quickly and get things back up. If a random small or midlevel company ran all its own server hardware and software, an outage would only inconvenience that company&rsquo;s customers. But the company would need to have the staff available to sort the problems out. That would be a large and arguably unnecessary overhead.</p>
<p>So I understand the desire to offload responsibilities to a service provider, and the economies of scale that a company specialising in running network services can bring. But I fear it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before one of these events results in serious damage or even loss of life.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m claiming to know what the answer is.</p>

<p>This is a historical novel, based on the real life of Charles Howard Hinton, a Victorian mathematician who studied the idea of a fourth spatial dimension. In fact, at least from this I&rsquo;d go further: he <em>believed in the existence</em> of such a dimension. He, I learned, was the originator of the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract">tesseract</a>, which &ndash; as I&rsquo;m sure you know &ndash; is the four-dimensional equivalent of a cube.</p>
<p>So much for that. What of the story? It&rsquo;s interesting, a little odd, and slightly experimental, in terms of its telling. It makes use of letters, diagrams, and other documents from Hinton&rsquo;s life. But a lot of the really interesting bits of Hinton&rsquo;s life &ndash; his bigamous marriage and being convicted for the same, and subsequent departure for, and time in, Japan, for example &ndash; are told largely offscreen. Or second-hand and partially, via some of those letters.</p>
<p>Which is all fair enough, but I feel that we didn&rsquo;t really get to know Hinton as a person. I could have done with more of that. In fact we get to know some other members of his family slightly better, as the story&rsquo;s focus changes in the second half.</p>
<p>The book is split into sections called &lsquo;Point,&rsquo; &lsquo;Line,&rsquo; &lsquo;Square,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cube,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tesseract,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cube,&rsquo; &lsquo;Square,&rsquo; &lsquo;Line,&rsquo; &lsquo;Point.&rsquo; Numbered chapters or subsections, 1 to 14, are included across the first &lsquo;Line&rsquo; and &lsquo;Square.&rsquo; But chapter 9 is missing, or skipped. I kept trying to find some mathematical reason for this &ndash; 9 is a square number, of course, but it&rsquo;s not the only square number in the list, and there&rsquo;s nothing special about 9 in the text, that I noticed. Nor is it one of the numbers we associate with a cube. Six faces, eight vertices, but not nine of anything. So I suspect it&rsquo;s actually a mistake. I might email Mark and ask him.</p>
<p>I first came to know of Hinton through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Rucker">Rudy Rucker&rsquo;s</a> books. The fourth dimension is one of Rucker&rsquo;s great interests, along with infinities, so Hinton was bound to come up. Apparently I&rsquo;ve never mentioned Rucker on my site before. That&rsquo;s a little surprising, but I suppose it&rsquo;s a good few years since I read anything by him. I&rsquo;m slightly surprised to find he&rsquo;s still alive: I thought I remembered hearing of his death (and was surprised I hadn&rsquo;t noted <em>that</em> here). Oh well, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Mandela_effect">Mandela effect</a>, I suppose.</p>
<p>Lastly, I noticed it was on the <a href="https://clarkeaward.medium.com/?p=d699487c087b">list of eligible titles for this year&rsquo;s Clarke Award</a> (and my apologies for linking to Medium). Which is odd, as it&rsquo;s not really a novel of the fantastic in any way (except maybe, the slightest hint of something towards the end). But it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first novel the the Clarke Award has noticed for which that is true. And Hinton wrote some SF himself, and inspired various SF writers as well as Rucker, so it kind of sits near the genre.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming. When <a href="/blog/2020/04/09/website-changes/">I moved my website</a> to <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> last year, I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the comments on the blog will disappear. They’re not lost, and I plan to get them back, but I need to find the best way to do that. For now, comment via Twitter or Micro.blog.</p>
<p>&ndash; Me, <a href="/blog/2020/04/09/website-changes/">Last year</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting them back, and setting up another system for comments, has taken me till now. I&rsquo;ve had <a href="link:/blog/tag/covid-19/">other</a> things <a href="link:/categories/cwma/">on my mind</a>.</p>
<p>That post was in April 2020. In May I wrote about various commenting systems I had experimented with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Disqus is known to track its users and show ads, and I don’t want that for anyone who might comment here.
…
So far I’ve tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://posativ.org/isso/">Isso</a>: you have to run a service on your site. I couldn’t get the service to respond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://staticman.net/">Staticman</a>: I couldn’t get its service to start. A problem with configuring the private key setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.remarkbox.com/">Remarkbox</a>: at the time of writing this is still active, but I’m not sure I’ll keep it. It works like Disqus, in that the comments are hosted on a third-party site, which is not really in keeping with the whole static site/indieweb ethos. It’s not advertising driven like Disqus, but it behaves a bit strangely, at least on here. We’ll see, though.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash; Also me, <a href="/blog/2020/05/01/static-leads-to-static/">Not quite so long ago</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remarkbox was active for a while. It worked, but it was just too <em>weird</em> in the way it handled users. I also tried Intense Debate, which is made by Automattic, the WordPress people, and is hosted on their servers. It worked, but I could only post comments using Chrome, for some reason. I&rsquo;m a Safari user, and even if I weren&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s a no-no.</p>
<p>So for a while I didn&rsquo;t have comments at all. I wonder if anyone noticed.</p>
<p>But recently I tried Isso again, and something clicked this time. It worked more or less without me having to do anything &ndash; at least, that is, when I ran it from the command line on my server. When I ran it as a service &ndash; that is, automatically, in the background, the way something like that needs to run &ndash; it just didn&rsquo;t work. A bit of Ducking led me <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/installing-isso-on-debian-apache.html">to this post</a>, which, despite being partly about Apache, when I use Nginx, gave me the pointers I needed to get it all working.</p>
<p>Isso keeps the comments on my server, rather than being an external service, so it&rsquo;s much more in keeping with the principle of owning my own content. And I&rsquo;ve imported the old comments from the WordPress site. I got some error messages when I ran the import, so I don&rsquo;t know if they all made it over, but at least <em>some</em> of them are here.</p>
<p>I need to work on the styling a bit, I think, but other than that it&rsquo;s all good to go.</p>

			 <p>Just over a year ago <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/06/16/you-are-your-thoughts-i-think/">I was posting, in passing</a>, about &lsquo;the quiet of early lockdown.&rsquo; Actually that particular phrase was a quote, but I was definitely aware of how quiet things were outside.</p>
<p>Including &ndash; particularly, in fact &ndash; in our back gardern. We live in a terrace, which means there are other people&rsquo;s back gardens in all directions around us, and quite close. A year ago it was quiet, not just from the lack of cars in the distance, of planes overhead, but also because no one much was in their gardens.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s a cacophony: music playing, dishes clattering, children shouting… I guess it&rsquo;s part of our return to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; &ndash; or toward &lsquo;normal,&rsquo; at least. But it&rsquo;s strange. It suggests that, last year in spring and early summer, people were scared to go out, not just into the streets, into shops, but into their own gardens.</p>
<p>No one caught Covid over a garden fence. Or so I imagine. At the same time, it didn&rsquo;t hurt to be cautious.</p>

			 <p>They say the vaccines give maximum resistance &lsquo;two to three weeks&rsquo; after the second dose. I <a href="/2021/06/03/vax.html">hit the two-week mark</a> yesterday, and now consider myself &lsquo;maxinated,&rsquo; more or less.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going swimming later today. It has been approximately fifteen and a half months since I last swam. Back in February  2020 and the preceding months, I was going two or three times a week, most weeks. So I&rsquo;ve missed it.</p>
<p>I had hoped to go to London Fields Lido: start outdoors, to keep things maximally safe. But it&rsquo;s all booked up till Monday, so I&rsquo;m going to the much closer, but less busy, King&rsquo;s Hall, my local pool.</p>
<p>Both, predictably, require bookings, so there&rsquo;s little chance of them being crowded.</p>
<p>In other covidian matters, remember back in March last year, when I <a href="/2020/03/27/this-video-on.html">shared a video of someone showing how to clean your shopping</a>? And then I quickly <a href="/2020/03/27/i-wish-i.html">walked it back</a>, on <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1243319180851580929.html">better advice</a>? Well, at that point we were already wiping down all items arriving in the house, much as the guy in the video was doing. And we continued to do it. I&rsquo;ve used more antiseptic wipes this last year than I&rsquo;ve owned in any previous year.</p>
<p>Yes, we soon learned that Covid was almost entirely transferred by air, and hardly by surfaces at all (though we also learned the word &lsquo;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fomite">fomite</a>'). But the idea that anything crossing the threshold was a potential infection vector burned deep, and remained.</p>
<p>Now, post vaccination, post maxination, will we keep on doing that? Probably not. It&rsquo;d be nice to get the time back when bringing the shopping home or receiving a delivery. But I don&rsquo;t know, it could take a while to stop feeling suspicious of things that have come in from out there.</p>
<p>Covid has made germophobes of us all.</p>

			 <p>I noticed that GitHub was down this morning &ndash; or not down, exactly, but its web pages were profoundly broken. I tried different browsers, then jumped on Twitter to see if it was widely reported.</p>
<p>It was. People were saying the problem was Fastly, a content delivery network (CDN). Also that it was affecting other sites. I don&rsquo;t know when CDNs started being a thing. I think they might have been recommended by some when I was still using WordPress. The idea being that a CDN can host your site&rsquo;s static assets &ndash; images, mainly &ndash; while WordPress carries on with the dynamic bits, generating HTML pages on the fly, as it does. The CDN&rsquo;s scale will mean it can serve those files faster than your little server.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t bother with them, not having that much traffic. But in the back of my mind there was always the thought, &lsquo;What if the CDN goes down?&rsquo; The idea, of course, was that the CDN would be big, multiply-redundant, reliable: it&rsquo;s not going to go down!</p>
<p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/08/tech/internet-outage-fastly/index.html">Here&rsquo;s a CNN report about the outage</a>. It affected a <em>lot</em> more than GitHub, it seems.</p>
<p>So, are CDNs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure">single points of failure</a>? Obviously there&rsquo;s more than one CDN, but if the failure of any one can disable large chunks of the web, do they put us in a better position?</p>

			 <p>News comes out that <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/06/02/prosus-acquires-stack-overflow/">Stack Overflow is being bought</a> by something called <a href="https://www.prosus.com/">Prosus</a>. I&rsquo;ve never heard of them, but they&rsquo;re &lsquo;a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors in the world,&rsquo; to quote their own site.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t bode well. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> is without doubt the most <em>useful</em> site in the world, at least as far as programming and other technical matters goes. And its sub-sites cover a vast range of interests beyond the technical: use of English for both <a href="https://ell.stackexchange.com">beginners</a> and <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com">experienced people</a>, for example; or <a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com">science fiction</a>; parenting, martial arts, the great outdoors, and <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites">a hundred more</a>.</p>
<p>When a big company buys up a small one, it rarely ends well for the users of the small company&rsquo;s products or services, or so it seems to me. Yahoo bought Flickr and let it largely wither on the vine.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Similarly with Del.icio.us. Google has bought numerous properties and either rolled them into its own products, or abandoned them.</p>
<p>In this case the purchaser is not a technology company itself, but just a holding company. Those ones tend to result in the bought company coming under pressure to make more money. The buyer wants to recover its investment. That tends to end up with the the bought company either selling intrusive advertising space, or selling its customers' data.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to go that way. Maybe this Prosus will be different. But I can&rsquo;t help thinking it&rsquo;s a sad day for mutual help on the web.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood why writers who write on writing get charged with creative onanism when artists are allowed to paint themselves until the Rembrandts come home or a work like Young Person&rsquo;s Guide to the Orchestra - music about music, right? - is fine with everyone</p>
<p>&ndash; David Mitchell, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/22/fiction.italocalvino">Enter the maze</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fair point. There&rsquo;s nothing <em>wrong</em> with a writer writing about a writer. I think the practice gets criticised because it became so common in literary fiction as to be a cliche.</p>
<p>The article also contains the revelation that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cloud Atlas<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was at least partly inspired by Calvino&rsquo;s novel.</p>

			 <p>I know, JK Rowling is a somewhat troubling figure now. When this book came out, last year, my daughter was adamant that we not buy it, because of Rowling&rsquo;s anti-trans statements, and I had respected her feelings up till now; as well as having my own concerns. But&hellip; the art, not the artist, I guess? Even if I&rsquo;m further enriching her by buying the art?</p>
<p>The truth is twofold: one, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s actively antithetical to trans people. She has a complex, nuanced position about various aspects of the situation, which gets blown out of all proportion on Twitter, when nuance, as it does, heads over there to die. And which, surprisingly and disappointingly for a wordsmith, she doesn&rsquo;t seem able to elucidate that well.</p>
<p>And two, I really like the books and wanted to read it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I <a href="/blog/2021/05/14/pastieland-and-getting-sick/">was sick</a>, and I had decided that I was going to treat the time on the sofa as an extension of the holiday, and not try to get back to working on the novel/dissertation till the Monday. I wanted some comfort reading, and this was what I wanted. I knew I&rsquo;d rip through it in a few days, <em>even if I was trying to work at the time</em>. So I killed two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, as ever. I don&rsquo;t really understand how she makes the pages turn so fast (there are a lot of them, especially as an ebook). I did pick up a couple of typos, and some odd line break errors, which might be to do with the translation to ebook &ndash; either way, it&rsquo;s very sloppy editing/proofreading by the publishers. Also some &ndash; several &ndash; places where I would have edited a line to make it better. I noticed fewer of those as the plot roared on, unsurprisingly. Which at least means I&rsquo;m reading even a book like this in a more writerly fashion. Or I was at the start.</p>
<p>The main other weaknesses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything comes together just a bit <em>too</em> tidily.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s too much about some of the secondary cases the agency is working on, over and above the main one. Those can be interesting or amusing, and sure, it&rsquo;s realistic that they&rsquo;d have to have more than just a forty-year-old cold case to work on, over a year. But in the end they feel like padding.</li>
<li>As the denouement unfolds she uses a gimmick where the characters learn or work out something, which they relate to each other, but which is not revealed to us. It&rsquo;s kind of annoying, because it&rsquo;s suddenly hiding info from the reader that the characters have, where earlier in the story that wasn&rsquo;t happening. I think she&rsquo;s done it before in some (maybe all) of the Strike novels.</li>
</ul>
<p>But a lot of fun, anyway.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve not posted here for a while. We managed a week-long trip to Cornwall &ndash; yes! Leaving home, leaving the city, staying in a rented house. It&rsquo;s almost like things are getting back to normal.</p>
<p>Though not quite. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevagissey">Mevagissey</a> is a great wee town, but it&rsquo;s far from fully open yet. Almost none of the restaurants have any outside space, what with it been squeezed in between the bottom of a steep hill and the sea, so they haven&rsquo;t reopened yet. The takeaways were open, but it&rsquo;s a sleepy place, and most things close early.</p>
<p>We stayed in Tregoney House, on the hill of the same name, which I mention here as much for my own records as anything else. Nice house, though.</p>
<p>We got to see family and eat pasties, fudge, and fish &amp; chips. And visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Gardens_of_Heligan">Lost Gardens of Heligan</a>. It was all quite exciting, really.</p>
<p>Then the day after we got home, I got sick. Not Covid, I&rsquo;m pleased to say, but it knocked me out for about four or five days. No writing, just some reading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all better now, though, and starting to buckle down for my dissertation. It&rsquo;s due in four months time, which suddenly seems perilously short.</p>

			 <p>This is a story of a family &ndash; especially two sisters &ndash; and things that brought them together and pushed them apart. It varies between straightforward realist events, and ambiguous, almost fantastic scenes, which may be memories, or partly memories, or a way for the character to deal with memories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of a series that Bernardine Evaristo has curated for Penguin, called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Black Britain: Writing Back<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, aiming to bring lost works back into publication.

			 <p>This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/27/senior-tories-urge-boris-johnson-to-come-clean-on-funding-of-no-10-refurb">story about Boris Johnson redecorating in Downing Street</a> is too stupid not to be a deliberate distraction. 10 Downing Street, along with 11 and others, are government buildings. Their maintenance should be paid for with government money. And since they are also places where people live, it&rsquo;s not unreasonable that there should be money available for redecoration when the resident changes.</p>
<p>And I guess it&rsquo;s <em>also</em> fair that the new resident can pay extra for the work, out of their own money, if they choose to do so. Any money coming from other sources would have to be declared in the <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/">Register of Members' Financial Interests</a>.</p>
<p>This is all normal. If Johnson has failed to declare contributions from his party or donors, that&rsquo;s the offence. It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>So the fact that it&rsquo;s filling the headlines with leaks and all, suggests it&rsquo;s a smokescreen for something else.</p>
<p>But what?</p>

			 <p>I just got an invite/reminder email about a service called <a href="https://www.onmail.com">OnMail</a>. I must have signed up to be notified when it became available. Could have been months ago: they apologise for it taking so long.</p>
<p>They should apologise for being bad for the email infrastructure that binds the world together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exaggerating, but only a bit. Email remains the most important thing on the internet aside from the web. Whenever you sign up for a service, or order something online, you expect to get an email confirmation.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Without reliable email, a lot of things would fall apart.</p>
<p>A while back <a href="/blog/2020/07/16/hey-ho-lets-not-go/">I wrote about Hey</a>, the new email service from <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. There, I was bothered by it not being based on the standard, open protocols that underlie email, at least to the extent that you can&rsquo;t get your Hey email using a third-party, standard client.</p>
<p>OnMail seems both visually and functionally similar to Hey, and it&rsquo;s got exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>This trend is bad for email, bad for people who use email. It should be possible to give us the kind of powerful, automated controls over our inboxes that these services offer, <em>without</em> stopping us from using the apps we prefer. It <em>is</em> possible to do that, as companies like <a href="https://www.sanebox.com">SaneBox</a> show.</p>
<p>I do not like this trend.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a fictionalisation of the breakdown of her marriage to the journalist Carl Bernstein, and it&rsquo;s amazing how funny she makes it, considering how painful the experience clearly was.</p>
<p>Seems to be her only novel, which is kind of a shame.</p>

			 <p>Despite the title, this is not a writing &lsquo;how-to&rsquo; book, except maybe by example. Nor is it a novel itself; it is a collection of essays. The subjects they cover do include writing and writing courses, most notably the Iowa Writers' Workshop. That was one of the first, if not <em>the</em> first, postgraduate-level courses in creative writing, and Chee studied on it.</p>
<p>But the book covers a lot else, too. As Chee is a mixed-race gay man, you won&rsquo;t be surprised to hear that those details feature in a number of the essays. As does living in New York and trying to make it as a writer. And growing roses, and the origin of Catholic rosary beads.</p>
<p>I was drawn to this because one of the essays was assigned reading on <a href="/categories/cwma">the MA</a> early this term, and he was also cited at various other points on at least two modules.</p>
<p>His debut novel is called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edinburgh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which immediately interests me. Though you learn from a couple of the essays that he hoped, when younger, to go to Edinburgh to <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/psychology/prospective/postgraduate/research-programmes/research-interests/parapsychology">study parapsychology</a>, but didn&rsquo;t; and that the Edinburgh connection in the novel didn&rsquo;t survive the writing and editing process, but he kept the title anyway.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what his fiction is like yet, but he&rsquo;s a fine essayist.</p>

			 <p>This is not, as you might have guessed from the title, about writing. It&rsquo;s about reading.</p>
<p>How long should we give a book by even a beloved author, before giving up on it, if we are not enjoying it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s relatively rare for me not to finish a book that I start. There are a few that I took a couple of runs at, having to start again &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ulysses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> springs to mind. And some that I haven&rsquo;t finished, and would have to start again: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gravity&rsquo;s Rainbow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Swann&rsquo;s Way<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I might never bother with either of those again, but you never know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly sure I&rsquo;ll never get further than the the two or three pages I&rsquo;ve managed into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And there&rsquo;s the odd other one I&rsquo;ve abandoned. One that I accidentally left on a train, and realised I didn&rsquo;t care. It was something to do with an excise inspector in Scotland. No idea what it was called or who it was by.</p>
<p>Most of those above are what people would call <em>difficult</em>: something about the style, form, or content makes reading them a challenge. Overcoming that challenge can be rewarding, but we should never feel guilty about abandoning them if we&rsquo;re not enjoying them, I feel. Reading for pleasure should not be a chore.</p>
<p>But now we come to a strange case. Claire North is an author I like a lot. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <a href="/blog/2015/03/06/the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august-by-claire-north-books-2015-2/">was great</a>, and so was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Touch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which <a href="/blog/2019/07/14/cite-touch-cite-by-claire-north-books-2019-8/">I read</a> the last time I was out of the country.</p>
<p>So I was pleased to get her <!-- raw HTML omitted -->84k<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for Christmas. And I&rsquo;ve tried to read it twice, but I just can&rsquo;t get into it. It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s boring or hard to read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s <em>unpleasant</em>.</p>
<p>That probably doesn&rsquo;t make a huge amount of sense. Lots of books have unpleasant characters, or depict upsetting or hurtful events. Lots of <em>entertainment</em> shows those things, TV, movies, songs&hellip;</p>
<p>I have <a href="/blog/2018/08/16/gilded-cage-tarnished-city-and-bright-ruin-by-vic-james-books-2018-21-22-23/">mentioned here before</a> that I don&rsquo;t really care for dystopias as a subgenre.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I&rsquo;m not sure I can easily explain why that is, but they just don&rsquo;t appeal.</p>
<p>And this is set in one. It&rsquo;s largely a version of Britain, more or less present-day, but things have gone so far into privatisation, rampant capitalism, and generally Conservative party policies, that everyone knows the value of a human life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the title means. That&rsquo;s how much, in pounds, the rich have to pay to get away with murder. They can do anything else they want, too, as long as they can afford it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it will have a positive, maybe even uplifting, outcome. But I won&rsquo;t be carrying on with it. I got about thirty pages in on my second time of starting it (only a couple the first time), and it&rsquo;s just too bleak, too grim, for me to want to spend any more time there.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s partly the times were living in. But it&rsquo;s not for me.</p>

			 <p>Here we are at the end of the second term of <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">my masters</a>. In fact, the end of the taught part of the whole thing. Teaching is finished. In the summer term, which starts a month today, We have a series of lectures from various writing teachers and people from the writing and publishing fields. But no more seminars, no workshops, unless we, the students, organise them ourselves.</p>
<p>I have two 5000-word pieces to submit in a month‘s time &ndash; one for the Creative Nonfiction module, and the other for the Writing Workshop. After that it‘s just solid writing and editing until I submit my dissertation in September.</p>
<p>That‘s not quite the whole story. I will also have two meetings with my dissertation supervisor. Or actually, supervisor<em>s</em>, because we have been assigned two. The reasoning seems to be that more people seeing our work is a good thing. I can certainly see the sense of that. But at the same time I wonder whether we‘ll lose the advantage of continuity. What if the first one recommends some changes, I make them (or at least, integrate their suggestions with my own ideas), and then the second recommends their opposite?</p>
<p>Oh well, it probably won‘t happen, and I‘ll deal with it if it does.</p>
<p>As for the two pieces I‘m submitting in a month, right now I have the required number of words for both. So I have a month to manipulate them, structure them, and make sure they‘re the <em>best</em> words. A process we writers call ‘editing.‘</p>

			 <p>Phase one complete, for me. I&rsquo;m not long back from the vaccination centre (a vacant unit at the Westfield shopping centre, slightly weirdly) where I got my first dose of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. I can feel my immune system surging, boosted with superpowers, and a strange, unearthly calm descend upon me.</p>
<p>I exaggerate. But it feels pretty damn good to have taken this step. I don&rsquo;t get the next one until June, and it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;ll be out of the woods even then; not even personally, and certainly not the country or the world. Especially given the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/eu-medicines-regulator-to-report-on-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-safety">panic over a statistically meaningless set of blood clots</a>, and the news today that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/17/nhs-covid-vaccine-rollout-under-50s-delayed-major-shortage">the UK&rsquo;s supply is going to be temporarily constrained</a>.</p>
<p>But considering that it&rsquo;s only just over year since we learned about this virus and the terrible disease it brings, it&rsquo;s worth taking a moment to celebrate the scientists and doctors who were able to develop the vaccines so quickly. Not to mention all the NHS staff who are getting it to people.</p>

			 <p>This article was in yesterday&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Independent<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I felt like I had travelled back in time to last May:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crucially, the report, which was written by independent experts, concludes that NHS guidelines failed to consider airborne infection, a key way the virus is transmitted.</p>
<p>&ndash; Sean Russel in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Independent<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nhs-covid-guidelines-nursing-union-b1813591.html">NHS Covid guidelines ‘fundamentally flawed’ and need replacing, says nursing union</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It further says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But research now suggests that airborne transmission – where tiny droplets of saliva from people talking, calling out or coughing can remain suspended in the air – can be a particular problem in poorly-ventilated rooms.</p>
<p>&ndash; As above, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nhs-covid-guidelines-nursing-union-b1813591.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Independent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Now&rsquo;? Research <em>now</em> suggests that it&rsquo;s airborne? We&rsquo;ve known that since at least June of last year. In fact, <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/02/wear-a-mask-and-celebrate-your-immune-system/">I first posted</a> about masks, and about <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/11/%20mask-society/">going out with a rudimentary one</a>, in early April!</p>
<p>How can NHS guidelines be so ludicrously far from what we understand? It would be <em>comically</em> far if it wasn&rsquo;t so serious.</p>

			 <p>This book is infuriating. At times, and in certain ways, at least. Or not the book, but some of the characters.</p>
<p>For example, the parents, especially the dad &ndash; are so fucking pathetic it makes me angry. He can&rsquo;t even boil an egg for his kids' breakfast when his wife&rsquo;s away.</p>
<p>And throughout the early part you&rsquo;re wondering why do they both love Lydia much more than their other two kids? Even before she dies, I mean?</p>
<p>Oh, yes it&rsquo;s a dead girl story, did I mention that? Lydia is fridged in the first line, so it&rsquo;s not a spoiler. It&rsquo;s totally a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Refrigerators">fridging</a>, though. That page tells you that the term means killing a female character &lsquo;often as a plot device intended to move a male character&rsquo;s story arc forward.&rsquo; Lydia&rsquo;s death drives the whole plot, including the actions of her father and brother, so it definitely qualifies.</p>
<p>Her mother and little sister too, but that doesn&rsquo;t lessen the truth of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good exposition of a family with secrets at its heart. Though in the case of some of the secrets, there&rsquo;s no very good reason for the person to keep them secret. A lot of problems could have been avoided &ndash; including, probably, the death of Lydia &ndash; if people had just <em>talked</em> to each other. That&rsquo;s part of what&rsquo;s so infuriating about it at times.</p>
<p>But maybe that &ndash; the difficulties people, families, have in communicating &ndash; is the point.</p>
<p>I also wondered why she chose to set it in the time she does. The present day parts are in 1977-8. I think it&rsquo;s so that she can write about the particular immigrant experience she does: second and third generation Chinese immigrants to the US.</p>
<p>I picked this up because one of my tutors recommended it to me, due to its use of an omniscient narrator. I&rsquo;m trying something similar with something I&rsquo;m working on at the moment. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/books/review/the-return-of-omniscience.html">This article in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> practically credits Ng with bringing omniscient narration back into fashion. I don&rsquo;t feel that it ever really went away, but maybe it has remained more common in SF than in literary fiction. Though as I write that I&rsquo;m not sure I could cite an example from recent SF either, so maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p><a href="https://deaddarlings.com/writing-quiet-omniscient-narrator-celeste-ng/">Here&rsquo;s a good article by Ng herself</a> about her decision to use the device. It&rsquo;s been useful to me, anyway. And I actually enjoyed the book, aside from being annoyed at times.</p>

			 <p>All through the Brexit debate, and after, people warned that it would cause problems in Northern Ireland. And now here we are:</p>

<p>What happens to our websites after we&rsquo;re gone? There needs to be a way to memorialise them, make sure they&rsquo;re still around in some form. <a href="https://archive.org">Archive.org</a> is great, but it doesn&rsquo;t keep the canonical URLs alive. Famously, <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> wrote, &lsquo;<a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs Don&rsquo;t Change</a>.&rsquo; Disappearance is the biggest change of all.</p>
<p>Although I see from there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretty much the only good reason for a document to disappear from the Web is that the company which owned the domain name went out of business or can no longer afford to keep the server running.</p>

<p>Hmm, is that a <em>good</em> reason? and it&rsquo;s surprisingly slanted towards companies, considering the origin of the web, and <a href="https://home.cern">TBL&rsquo;s place of work</a>.</p>
<p>(And speaking of <em>cool</em> URIs &ndash; or domains &ndash; <code>home.cern</code>? That is fantastic!)</p>

<p>What were we thinking? Gathering together in a small hall, where people were singing and shouting. And not a mask to be seen! Masks? who had masks? How would we have drunk our beer while wearing a mask? You probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been let in if you had turned up wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Although <a href="/blog/2020/02/28/6304/">I had good social distancing at the start</a>, when I was almost the only one there.</p>

<p>Date is approximate, and anyway we watched the various parts over two or three weeks.</p>
<p>Really good, though annoying in places. Fran Lebowitz is great on many things, misanthropic on many things, and would be fun to talk to. Scorsese is a great interviewer, but he doesn’t have to laugh at <em>everything</em> she says.</p>

			 <p>I got a <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenjjohnson/status/1362428938161688577">reply</a> to the <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/1362427111311511553">Twitter version</a> of my <a href="/blog/2021/02/18/152330/">last post</a> which pointed me to something called the <a href="https://making.engr.wisc.edu/mask-fitter/">Badger Seal</a>. It&rsquo;s a DIY attachment you can make that&rsquo;s meant to hold masks on better. Not just at the top for the glasses issue, but all around, for overall better filtration.</p>
<p>Because let&rsquo;s face it, when we breathe out with a mask on, a lot of that breath is <em>not</em> going through the mask, but round the sides.</p>
<p>It looks like it might be pretty effective, but making it looks like a hassle &ndash; or at least, getting the components. It needs something called &lsquo;foam wire,&rsquo; which I&rsquo;ve never heard of, and I don&rsquo;t know if you can even get it in this country (a quick search at B&amp;Q&rsquo;s site suggests not). But if you can, it&rsquo;s likely to be in a big roll, when all you want is 30cm or so per mask.</p>
<p>Not to put a downer on good ideas, I mean. That site sells them too, but they&rsquo;re heavily back ordered, and who knows how long they&rsquo;ll take to get here from the US.</p>
<p>There are other, similar, things out there, but I can&rsquo;t so far find anything sourced in the UK.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll <a href="/blog/2020/12/01/stop-your-glasses-steaming-up-by-sticking-the-top-of-your-mask-to-your-face-using-micropore-tape/">stick with micropore</a> for now.</p>

			 <p>It took me quite a long while to read this. I enjoyed it whenever I read a section, and I read it in large chunks at a time; but between times I wasn&rsquo;t particularly drawn back to it. I think that&rsquo;s probably because it doesn&rsquo;t have any significant plot.</p>
<p>Instead it&rsquo;s a series of character explorations, looking at a series of Black women (and a few men) over several decades of the twentieth century and the first two of the twenty-first.</p>
<p>Each story is compelling and enjoyable, and they&rsquo;re all interlinked &ndash; almost <em>too</em> interlinked at times, you might say, because there&rsquo;s an element of coincidence. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter: coincidences happen, after all.</p>
<p>Perhaps the major downside is that you get interested and invested in a character, and their chapter ends and we move on to another one. So it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re always starting fresh. Or fresh-ish. That&rsquo;s probably also part of why I had the experience I described at the start, of not being drawn back to it.</p>
<p>Because of <a href="/categories/cwma/">my course</a>, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the choices writers make. So I was particularly aware of Evaristo&rsquo;s unconventional choices regarding punctuation and capitalisation. Specifically, she capitalises proper nouns, but no other words. So sentences all start with lower-case letters. And she eschews almost all punctuation. Only  the comma, the apostrophe, the question mark, and an occasional exclamation mark, are used.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
{.has-dropcap}</p>
<p>No full stops means &ndash; and I only consciously realised this when looking it over to write this &ndash; that every sentence starts a new paragraph, and comprises the whole of the paragraph. Even when a sentence does end with a question mark or exclamation mark, she has it end the paragraph.</p>
<p>All of which is fine. I found it noticeable, but not distracting. I just wonder what the intended effect is. Some people say they find things like quotes to delineate speech intrusive, and I&rsquo;ve heard it said that leaving capitals off the start of sentences feels more informal. But I feel generally that most established conventions have good reasons for existing, and that the best approach is to keep to them, unless you have a very good reason for not doing so. I don&rsquo;t think this novel would in any way be lessened if it were capitalised and punctuated conventionally.</p>
<p>And then I would be talking more about the content, not the form.</p>

			 <p>It looks as if I haven&rsquo;t read anything yet this year. That&rsquo;s far from true, of course, but this is the first book-length work I&rsquo;ve finished. Though that &lsquo;book-length&rsquo; is extremely deceptive, as it&rsquo;s very short.</p>
<p>I read it for <a href="https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/">my course</a> &ndash; specifically the Creative Nonfiction module that I&rsquo;m doing this term. It&rsquo;s a powerful statement about the position of Black people in America in the early 60s, when it was written. Things have sadly not changed much.</p>
<p>In terms of presentation, it&rsquo;s a little odd. It&rsquo;s titled as two letters: one <a href="https://progressive.org/magazine/letter-nephew/">to his nephew</a>, and another &lsquo;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/11/17/letter-from-a-region-in-my-mind">from a region in my mind</a>.&rsquo; The first is short, and does read as if it were a letter. The second, not so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a personal essay, combining memoir and political analysis. It shows a great deal of empathy, both for Black people and the white majority in his country. And it ends with a note of hope, that America can still become the country it claimed to be. I wonder what he&rsquo;d think of things now.</p>
<p>Both parts are available at those links, so you don&rsquo;t even have to buy it if you want to check it out, which you should.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/01/the-big-short-2015-12/">I watched the film <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Big Short<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> last year, I doubted that it would help people gain real understanding of financial markets and the problems that caused the crash of 2008-9:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might come out of this film with a better understanding of the events that led to the 2008 financial crisis — or you might not. More likely, I think, you’ll sort-of understand it while you’re watching, but be none the wiser when it’s all over.</p>
<p>&ndash; Me, <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/01/the-big-short-2015-12/">The Big Short, 2015 - ★★½</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I count myself very much in that none-the-wiser position, then and now. In particular, while I knew that the &lsquo;short&rsquo; involved somehow betting that the price of a share would go down, it had never clicked with me exactly <em>how</em> the &lsquo;short seller&rsquo; could make a profit.</p>
<p>Until today, when I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/_jimmykelly/status/1354600999835607041">this tweet</a>, apropos of the members of a subreddit bringing a hedge fund to bankruptcy, by taking advantage of the fund&rsquo;s short position. The tweet contains a screen grab of the written explanation, unfortunately, and the tweeter doesn&rsquo;t know the originator of the text, but here it is:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The key step that I had never understood was the the short seller <em>borrows</em> the shares, and then sells them at the current price. If they drop in price, the seller buys them back and returns them to the original owner. I don&rsquo;t think I ever realised that you <em>could</em> borrow shares. If you can own something, you can borrow or lend it, I guess, even if it&rsquo;s imaginary, so it does make sense. If I had ever thought of it, I would have thought, well why would you borrow something that you can&rsquo;t do anything with?</p>
<p>But you <em>can</em> do something with it: sell it.</p>

			 <p>Four years ago, in a piece called &lsquo;<a href="/blog/2017/01/31/which-is-worse/">Which is Worse?</a>,&rsquo; I wrote that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brexit is worse than Trump, because Trump is only for four years — less if he gets impeached or twenty-fived, which is almost certain; but Brexit is forever.</p>
<p>&ndash; Me, <a href="/blog/2017/01/31/which-is-worse/">Which is Worse?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who would have thought, back then, that, while Trump would be gone (having been impeached not once but <em>twice</em>) but Brexit, in its final form, would only be getting started?</p>
<p>I use the word &lsquo;final&rsquo; facetiously. David Allen Green has been writing about this too, and he avers:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2016, American voters (via the electoral college) elected Trump for a term of four years, while those in the United Kingdom voted for Brexit with no similar fixed term.</p>
<p>One decision was set to be revisited in four years, the other was not.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>There will be no cathartic Biden-like ceremony to bring Brexit to a close.</p>
<p>This is because of the nature of the 2016 referendum (which, unlike the election of Trump, was not a decision for a fixed period); and because of the dynamic structure of the new relationship as set out in the trade and cooperation agreement; and because of the unsettled politics both internally in the United Kingdom and of its relationship with the European Union.</p>
<p>And so, to a significant (though not a total) extent, the United States was able to bring what it decided in 2016 to a formal and substantial end, the United Kingdom cannot similarly do so.</p>
<p>For the United Kingdom, 2016 is here to stay.</p>
<p>&ndash; David Allen Green, <a href="https://davidallengreen.com/2021/01/the-united-states-had-its-cathartic-post-2016-post-trump-ceremonial-moment-but-the-united-kingdom-cannot-have-a-similar-post-2016-post-brexit-moment/">The United States had its cathartic post-2016, post-Trump ceremonial moment – but the United Kingdom cannot have a similar post-2016, post-Brexit moment</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His &lsquo;here to stay,&rsquo; and my &lsquo;forever&rsquo; could be overstating the case. I feel sure that the United Kingdom, in some form, or at least parts of it, will join the European Union again one day. How far away that day is, and what form the accession country or countries of the time will have, we can only learn by living through it. It will be more than another four years, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

			 <p>Every month Google, or specifically the &lsquo;Google Search Console Team&rsquo; sends me an email showing the &lsquo;Top performing pages&rsquo; on my site. Presumably that means the ones to which they, Google, have sent the most people.</p>
<p>Consistently, the top one is a post from 2012, about a particular use case of <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>. Specifically: <a href="/blog/2012/07/02/tip-using-pandoc-to-create-truly-standalone-html-files/">Tip: using Pandoc to create truly standalone HTML files</a>.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clear that if I want more engagement here &ndash; or at least more drive-by readers &ndash; I should write more technical-support-type articles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unlikely to happen at the moment. That page was a complete mess, though. There were artifacts left over from WordPress plugins, and the whole thing was displaying at the wrong width for reasons that I don&rsquo;t understand. So I&rsquo;ve cleaned it up, and now at least it looks a bit more welcoming for the hundreds of visitors who come every month.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure what it describes is still necessary &ndash; Pandoc has had a lot of changes since then &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not <em>wrong</em>, so oh well.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of the pasta shape called bucatini before (though the Mac spellchecker has), but it sounds fabulous, and I want to try it now. I won&rsquo;t be able to, though (even if you can get it in the UK). This article by Rachel Handler in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York<!-- raw HTML omitted --> magazine is great: both hilarious and fascinating by turns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things first began to feel off in March. While this sentiment applies to everything in the known and unknown universe, I mean it specifically in regard to America’s supply of dry, store-bought bucatini. At first, the evidence was purely anecdotal. My boyfriend and I would bravely venture to both our local Italian grocer and our local chain groceries, masked beyond recognition, searching in vain for the bucatini that, in my opinion, not to be dramatic, is the only noodle worth eating; all other dry pastas might as well be firewood. But where there had once been abundance, there was now only lack. Being educated noodle consumers, we knew that there was, more generally, a pasta shortage due to the pandemic, but we were still able to find spaghetti and penne and orecchiette — shapes which, again, insult me even in concept. The missing bucatini felt different. It was specific. Frightening. Why bucatini? Why now? Why us?</p>
<p>&ndash; Rachel Handler, <a href="https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/12/2020-bucatini-shortage-investigation.html">What the Hole Is Going On? The very real, totally bizarre bucatini shortage of 2020.</a></p>

			 <p>The first of my Christmas books, so I <em>could</em> count it as next year&rsquo;s; but since I had finished it by the day after Boxing Day, it definitely belongs to this year. And it also brings me to a nice round 30 books for the year.</p>
<p>A writer is isolated in a lonely alpine chalet to write about a book he hates. Which very quickly turns out to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Frankenstein<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. He is visited by &ndash; well, that would be telling, but just let&rsquo;s say that the novel he&rsquo;s writing about and its creator are <em>very significant</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written &ndash; at least at first &ndash; as if it was the writer writing to his publisher, though that conceit soon disappears. There are various details around the way it&rsquo;s printed, that look as if they should be significant, but they aren&rsquo;t really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. Check it out.</p>

			 <p>Well, this year of infamy is finally lurching towards its end. I don&rsquo;t think too many of us will be sad to see the back of 2020.</p>
<p>With it, though, we have to also say a final goodbye to Britain&rsquo;s membership of the European Union. I don&rsquo;t think too many of us will be happy about that. Even people who are pleased about it now will realise over time that leaving is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>At least with the exit agreement in place, we shouldn&rsquo;t see the immediate shortages and queues at the ports that we feared. That agreement is problematic, though.</p>
<p>To get an example of its dangers, I refer you to David Allen Green&rsquo;s Law and Policy Blog. Yesterday&rsquo;s post is entitled &lsquo;<a href="https://davidallengreen.com/2020/12/the-bill-implementing-the-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-is-an-exercise-in-the-government-taking-power-from-parliament/">The Bill implementing the Trade and Cooperation Agreement is an exercise in the Government taking power from Parliament</a>,&rsquo; and in it he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The draft bill is complex and deals with several specific technical issues, such as criminal records, security, non-food product safety, tax and haulage, as well as general implementation provisions.</p>
<p>Each of these specific technical issues would warrant a bill, taking months to go through the normal parliamentary process.</p>
<p>But instead they will be whizzed and banged through in a single day, with no real scrutiny, as the attention of parliamentarians will (understandably) be focused on the general implementation provisions, which are in Part 3 of the draft bill.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>This provision will empower ministers (or the devolved authorities, where applicable) to make regulations with the same effect as if those regulations were themselves acts of parliament.</p>
<p>In other words: they can amend laws and repeal (or abolish) laws, with only nominal parliamentary involvement.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions (under clause 31(4)), but even with those exceptions, this is an extraordinarily wide power for the executive to legislate at will.</p>
<p>These clauses are called ‘Henry VIII’ clauses and they are as notorious among lawyers as that king is notorious in history.</p>
<p>Again, this means that parliament (and presumably the devolved assemblies, where applicable) will be bypassed, and what is agreed between Whitehall and Brussels will be imposed without any further parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ndash; David Allen Green, <a href="https://davidallengreen.com/2020/12/the-bill-implementing-the-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-is-an-exercise-in-the-government-taking-power-from-parliament/">The Bill implementing the Trade and Cooperation Agreement is an exercise in the Government taking power from Parliament</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole piece is worth reading (and note the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> references).</p>
<p>Take back control, right enough: take it back from the elected representatives of the people, and give it to the executive.</p>
<p>2020 made 2016 look like 2012. 2021 offers hope to the world as the Covid vaccines roll out, and hope for America as Trump is rolled out of the White House. But things still look decidedly dodgy here in the UK.</p>

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/12/31/xstabeth-by-david-keenan-books/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-12-31 10:20:10 &#43;0000">Dec 31, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Following on <a href="/blog/2020/12/11/the-towers-the-fields-the-transmitters-by-david-keenan-books-2020-27/">from number 27</a>, then, we have David Keenan&rsquo;s latest novel. Again we&rsquo;re in a kind of magic-realist setting, without any obvious magic. In St Petersburg a young woman lives with her father, who is a failed or fading musician. The daughter &ndash; who is the viewpoint character &ndash; starts a relationship with her father&rsquo;s friend, and gets pregnant. She keeps all of this from her father.</p>
<p>Her father, meanwhile, puts on a show at which he performs some seemingly-otherworldly music. He starts to believe that it was actually created by some sort of mystical entity called Xstabeth.</p>
<p>For reasons that escape me at the moment they go to St Andrews,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> where they get involved with a professional golfer. The &lsquo;tenuous, ambiguous, confusing event&rsquo; that I referred to in the earlier note happens from this side too, but you&rsquo;d only notice it if you&rsquo;d read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Towers The Fields The Transmitters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The novel is presented as if it were an academic work <em>about</em> a novel called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Xstabeth<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by someone called &lsquo;David Keenan,&rsquo; who killed himself by jumping from a tower in St Andrews. So there are cod-academic sections or extracts between the chapters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very meta, and I enjoyed it, but I&rsquo;m not sure I totally understood it. The strangest thing about it, in some ways, is the use of punctuation. Almost the only punctuation used is the full stop. But that doesn&rsquo;t just mean he&rsquo;s avoided using commas and semicolons, and constructed appropriately short sentences. It reads as if he wrote it with conventional punctuation around dialogue and so on, and then replaced every other mark with the full stop.</p>
<p>For example, consider this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is singular. He said. This is music that cannot be repeated. This is music that can never be toured. This is music that can never be applauded. I pointed out to him that there was applause on the record. Muted Applause. Awkward applause. Uncomprehending applause. But still. Applause. What is the sound of one audience member clapping. I asked him. He laughed. Yes. He said. Yes. Yes. There is no mechanic in the world for this music. He said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more conventional way to punctuate that and lay it out, might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;This is singular,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;This is music that cannot be repeated; this is music that can never be toured; this is music that can never be applauded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I pointed out to him that there was applause on the record. Muted applause; awkward applause; uncomprehending applause; but still: applause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the sound of one audience member clapping?&rsquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>He laughed. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;yes, yes. There is no mechanic in the world for this music,&rsquo; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are, of course, other ways you could present it. As an experimental way of presenting text, it&rsquo;s interesting enough. I found it intruded, in that I constantly noticed it; but not so much as to be annoying. Though there were places where it was slightly confusing. I paid particular attention to it because we recently discussed ways to present dialogue on <a href="/categories/cwma/">my course</a>.</p>

			 <p>Just when you think that this Tory government couldn&rsquo;t possibly sink any lower, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it is a real scandal that Unicef should be playing politics in this way when it is meant to be looking after people in the poorest, the most deprived, countries of the world where people are starving, where there are famines and where there are civil wars, and they make cheap political points of this kind, giving, I think, 25,000 to one council.

			 <p>Strange one, this. I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/09/08/this-is-memorial-device-by-david-keenan-books-2018-24/">read Keenan&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is Memorial Device<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> a couple of years ago, so when I saw a new one by him listed on <a href="https://pagesofhackney.co.uk">my local bookshop&rsquo;s</a> &lsquo;forthcoming&rsquo; page, I had a look.</p>
<p>That book was <a href="https://www.thesocial.com/gnostic-golf-epiphanies-with-david-keenan/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Xstabeth<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>, and more on it <a href="/blog/2020/12/31/xstabeth-by-david-keenan-books-2020-29/">in a few posts' time</a>. It hadn&rsquo;t yet been released at the time, but there was a special offer from the publishers: upload proof that you had preordered it (such as the receipt from your local bookshop) and you&rsquo;d get a free novella-length ebook prequel: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Towers The Fields The Transmitters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So I did all that, and here we are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll note right away that, having read both, they seem to be connected only by location and one tenuous, ambiguous, confusing event.</p>
<p>In fact those terms apply throughout this book. It&rsquo;s kind of a magical realism piece, set mostly in St Andrews.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A businessman visits the town to audit the books of a military facility, and starts trying to find his missing daughter. Why does he think she might be in St Andrews? That is never explained. Nor does it need to be.</p>
<p>Time goes weird, with second-world-war bombers appearing in the skies. Or on the phone, at least.</p>
<p>The more I try to write about this, the more it feels like a hallucination I had a few weeks ago. Very strange. Worth reading.</p>

			 <h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>If, like all sensible people, you wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you go out these days; and if, like me and millions of others, you wear glasses; then you will have experienced your breath causing your glasses to steam up.</p>
<p>The cause is a fundamental flaw in mask design: the mask fabric makes a straight line from our cheeks to the bridge of our noses, leaving a gap between face and mask seam. Most of our out-breaths are directed that way, just by taking the path of least resistance.</p>
<p>Some masks have a wire insert that lets you mould the top section around your nose. I find that improves things, but is still imperfect. There are always gaps.</p>
<h2 id="the-bigger-problem">The Bigger Problem</h2>
<p>This means that the masks are not as effective as they should be for their primary purpose. All that warm, damp air that&rsquo;s condensing on our glasses is <em>also</em> the air that might be carrying virus particles.</p>
<p>So while this solution helps with the steamed-up glasses problem, it also helps to make masks more effective, by ensuring that more of our potentially-poisonous breath goes through the fabric.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite simple: apply a strip of micropore tape to the section of the mask that goes over the bridge of your nose, and seal it down well.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Micropore tape is normally used for fixing dressings on wounds, so it&rsquo;s designed to stick to skin and come off with minimal fuss (though see below).</p>
<p>The roll we had when I thought of this is quite wide, so I&rsquo;ve been folding a piece over and attaching it to the inside of the mask (at <a href="http://twitter.com/FranChats">@FranChats</a>&rsquo;s suggestion).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s not attached very tidily, but we&rsquo;re not in this for the aesthetics.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And it&rsquo;s not actually visible when the mask is on.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-problems-removal-and-sensitivity">The New Problems: Removal, and Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Taking the taped mask off is the worst part, in my experience. I&rsquo;ve been doing it quickly: take off my glasses (otherwise they might go flying across the room); unhook the ear loops and take a firm grip of them; close my eyes; then tug sharply forward.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It can make your eyes water, but honestly, for clear vision outside on these cold days, it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>Removing it slowly might be better for some people. And the whole thing will not be for some. If you have very sensitive skin, or get a reaction to the adhesive, then this won&rsquo;t be for you. But if you can take it, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Lastly, my pictures show a reusable mask, but it works for disposables too.</p>

			 <p>I thought it might be interesting, in this year of a US presidential election, to reread this account of a different reelection campaign of a terrible president.</p>
<p>In this one, of course, the president &ndash; Nixon &ndash; was successfully reelected. And it was only in his second term that he was impeached &ndash; or nearly so. He resigned first, and Ford, his veep, now president, pardoned him. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if Trump and Pence try the same sort of thing in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>This book doesn&rsquo;t get as far as Nixon&rsquo;s resignation. Thompson followed the Democratic campaign, and then George McGovern&rsquo;s campaign once he got the nomination, as part of the press pack. He was National Affairs Editor for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rolling Stone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at the time. A title and role that he created.</p>
<p>So this is essentially a fix-up of his columns, with some edits, and the odd footnote adding information that wasn&rsquo;t available at the time. It&rsquo;s classic HST, of course, with not quite as many illegal drugs as in some of his works.</p>
<p>The most intriguing thing in the whole book for me was this quote from p189:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For almost a year now, he [Pat Cadell] has been George McGovern&rsquo;s official numbers wizard. Cadell and his <strong>Cambridge Research Associates</strong> have been working the streets and suburban neighborhoods in New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts for McGovern, then coming back to headquarters on election nite [sic] and calling the results almost down to the percentage point&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine, ellipsis his. I&rsquo;m just struck by the name of the organisation, and the fact that they&rsquo;re doing a not dissimilar thing to Cambridge Analytica &ndash; in terms of analysis, if not manipulation &ndash; in a pre-computer age. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any connections between the two organisations.</p>
<p>On the very next page we have this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even reading and watching <em>all the news</em>, there is no way to know the truth &ndash; except to be there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which resonates profoundly in today&rsquo;s &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; world.</p>

			 <p>Read this for my course. It&rsquo;s very good, unsurprisingly. Historical fiction isn&rsquo;t usually my thing (Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/tag/baroque-cycle/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Baroque Cycle<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> notwithstanding) It has a striking stylistic tic &ndash; if that&rsquo;s the right word &ndash; in the way she refers to Thomas Cromwell. It&rsquo;s always &lsquo;he said,&rsquo;  or &lsquo;he did such-and-such&rsquo;; very occasionally, for clarity, &lsquo;he, Cromwell&hellip;&rsquo; But never just, &lsquo;Cromwell said&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not a big deal, but in a work of this size, it stands out. It feels <em>significant</em>. And it is; &lsquo;tic&rsquo; is the wrong word for something so definite, so chosen. Mantel has said that she wanted the viewpoint to be &lsquo;over Cromwell&rsquo;s shoulder.&rsquo; So &lsquo;he&rsquo;, rather than &lsquo;Cromwell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of the most subtle things about it as how Cromwell switches from just being an advisor to the king to rounding up certain priests, and I don’t really understand how it happened. It&rsquo;s a masterpiece of characterisation.</p>

<p>But I came round to it. It&rsquo;s set in the very far future, because there are examples of technology that is old, but people don&rsquo;t understand it.

<p>The titular character is the first of her people to leave Earth (we assume it&rsquo;s Earth, anyway) to go to Oomza University, which appears to be a whole planet that&rsquo;s a university, and takes people from many different species and civilisations.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;re halfway through the first term of my <a href="/categories/cwma/">Creative Writing masters</a> course. Those five weeks went fast, but 2020 is The Year When Time Was Weird, for everyone. How is it going, you ask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Pretty well, thanks. At first glance, with only two actual sessions, the workload looked light. But as is common with postgraduate courses, you have a lot of work to do on your own. Add to that, it&rsquo;s a <em>writing</em> course: we have to write, and you can&rsquo;t do that while sitting in a class.</p>
<p>Or you could, for small exercises, and I think maybe they would be asking us to do that kind of thing if this were a conventional year and we were sitting in a seminar room in Bloomsbury. It is, however, the most unconventional of years, and we are sitting in our own homes on Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>There are two modules. Everyone does the Writing and Reading Seminar, where we focus on short stories. Each week we read and discuss two or three assigned stories, with there being a theme or area of focus: Character, Voice, Territory, for example. Then we workshop pieces submitted by three members of the class. Everyone gets to submit a piece of up to 4000 words, twice this term.</p>
<p>For my first piece I decided to get out of my comfort zone (such as it is) and write a purely realist piece. No spaceships, no magic; no element of the fantastic whatsoever. I think it worked out pretty well.</p>
<p>Those pieces are not assessed, but in January we have to submit a 4000-word piece that will be. I only recently learned that this piece has to be a reworking of one of the two pieces we&rsquo;ll have workshopped in class. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have done anything differently, but I would have liked to have known that sooner.</p>
<p>The second module I&rsquo;m doing is called Contemporary Writing 2: Genre<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, or just &lsquo;Genre.&rsquo;  We spend two weeks on each of these genres: crime, science fiction, historical fiction, and young adult fiction.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> There&rsquo;s a novel assigned for each one. The first week has a two short, prerecorded lectures, and in the seminar we discuss those, and techniques, and the assigned novel.</p>
<p>For the second week we each write a 1000-word piece in the genre in question, and some of us have the pieces workshopped. We got to choose the genres in which we wanted to be workshopped. I chose SF and crime. Even those of us who aren&rsquo;t being workshopped in a given week have our pieces discussed on the class forum.</p>
<p>So as you can see, there&rsquo;s quite a lot of reading, analysis, and commenting, as well as actual writing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying it a lot, but if you were to ask me what I&rsquo;ve learned, I&rsquo;m not sure I could specify that yet. However, the practice, the fact of looking at my own writing and that of others, professionally-published and not, in great detail: that alone is bound to improve my writing, I feel.</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s reading week. I don&rsquo;t recall having such a thing back when I was an undergraduate, but maybe we did. They&rsquo;re standard now, just like half-term breaks at school.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> So we have no classes, and some extra short stories to read, and time to catch up on the novels. I finished <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wolf Hall<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday, so I only have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Hate U Give<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to read for YA. Plenty of time to get some writing done.</p>
<p>Oh, and a couple of homework assignments, too. All work is homework, of course.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always confused about how you should punctuate that idiom. I&rsquo;m asking a question: it needs a question mark. But neither of these look right:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is it going? you ask.</li>
<li>How is it going, you ask?</li>
</ul>
<p>It should really be:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;How is it going?&rsquo; you ask.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that makes it too much like I&rsquo;m writing dialogue in a a second-person narrative, and it doesn&rsquo;t really fit with the overall feel of a blog post.</p>
<p>The way I&rsquo;ve written it above has no question mark at all, and that can&rsquo;t be right.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

I can&rsquo;t find any evidence of it now, because there are so many other pages about half-term holiday dates and history projects for October half term. But if my memory is not totally faulty, that&rsquo;s the truth of it.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Robin Rendle writes about writing about typography, but he has lessons for all of us who want to write well.</p>
<p>Though I don&rsquo;t entirely agree with his viewpoint about the particular sentence he criticises. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A revival is based on historical models, made suitable for contemporary use, adapted to the typographical and technical needs of today, but nevertheless relies on a personal response to the historical style.</p>
<p>&ndash; The Rosart Project, <a href="https://www.rosart.nl/">The Rosart Project</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &lsquo;revival&rsquo; it&rsquo;s talking about involves  recreating old typefaces, and/or building new versions of them. It&rsquo;s from a site called <a href="https://www.rosart.nl/">The Rosart Project</a>, set up by some students of typography.</p>
<p>Rendle&rsquo;s essay at an improved version of that sentence is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Type designers will often look at letterforms that were made in the past and then redraw them for modern day use. This is called a “revival” by the type community but I like to think of it as a remix: a type designer will unavoidably apply their own style and harmonies, their own deviations and melodies to the song.</p>
<p>Every remix is different, every remix is important.</p>
<p>&ndash; Robin Rendle, <a href="http://robinrendle.com/notes/writing-about-typography.html">Writing about Typography</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is certainly brighter, has a bit more sparkle, and arguably is easier to understand. But I don&rsquo;t think the original is <em>that</em> bad. Certainly not as bad as Rendle thinks. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what does any of this mean? The words make sense but it’s written in a style that’s familiar to anyone that reads about the field of typography. It’s what’s known to folks outside the field as “academic writing” but it’s what I consider to simply be bad writing—it’s waffling and unclear.</p>
<p>&ndash; Robin Rendle, <a href="http://robinrendle.com/notes/writing-about-typography.html">Writing about Typography</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s what is often called <em>dry</em>, I&rsquo;d say, certainly compared to the alternative. But I don&rsquo;t think it deserves quite the fire he brings to it. Of course he&rsquo;s only doing it &ndash; he says, and I believe him &ndash; because he loves the project, and wants to &lsquo;see the whole typographic community break the shackles of this style of writing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Which is fair enough. I&rsquo;d certainly rather read a piece in Rendle&rsquo;s style than much academic writing. So I guess maybe I do agree with him after all. His final advice to the typographic community could apply just about anywhere where words are used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>write to swoon, to convince, to make a stranger fall in love. Abandon the academic style, because it’s making your beautiful work so very boring.</p>
<p>&ndash; Robin Rendle, <a href="http://robinrendle.com/notes/writing-about-typography.html">Writing about Typography</a></p>

			 <p>Crime fiction set in Dublin. In a posh boarding school, specifically, which causes it to have elements of young adult (YA) fiction. We studied it for the &lsquo;Genre&rsquo; module of my MA course. It also dips into magic realism, so it&rsquo;s particularly appropriate for that module.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t read any of French&rsquo;s books before. This is volume five in a series about the Dublin Murder Squad, but they&rsquo;re only loosely linked. I enjoyed it a lot, and wouldn&rsquo;t mind reading more.</p>
<p>She has a great way with colour imagery, and compelling characters.</p>

<p>ideas for rethinking blogs and feeds. I found, as others have, that I need another kind of document to include in my personal CMS other than a story that&rsquo;s part of the blog. Everything about blogs are set up to be written, then lightly edited, and never touched again. It&rsquo;s <strong>temporal</strong> writing. But there are other things that I want to develop over time, keep coming back to, revising. A few years back I started this.how to hold those docs.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s talking about what I like to call &lsquo;web pages,&rsquo; surely? You don&rsquo;t need any fancy CMS for those, as Dave of all people should know. And if you want to use such a thing, well, even WordPress has its Posts/Pages distinction.</p>

			 <p>A few years ago <a href="/blog/2017/07/19/not-the-nails-im-looking-for/">I wrote about how I was notified about the wrong band called (The) Nails</a>. In that case the names were different, though only by the subtle presence or absence of the definite article. Things have got even more confusing recently.</p>
<p>I have an app on my phone called <a href="https://apps.Apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750">Music Harbor</a> (sic). The idea is, you give it access to your music library, and it notifies you of forthcoming releases by artists you already have tracks by. It sometimes throws up some oddities, like people I&rsquo;ve never heard of just because they&rsquo;re &lsquo;<a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/06/little-feat/">featured</a>&rsquo; on something I have. But mostly it&rsquo;s pretty good. It&rsquo;s how I know that Bruce Springsteen has a new album coming out in a few days, for example.</p>
<p>A few years back I heard a track called &lsquo;Bass Down Low,&rsquo; by someone called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev_(singer)">Dev</a>. I liked it, both musically and lyrically. I mean, it&rsquo;s not <em>profound</em>, but &lsquo;I like my beats fast and my bass down low&rsquo; is a sentiment I can get behind.</p>
<p>So there was a new track by Dev out today. However, the guy rapping on &lsquo;<a href="https://music.Apple.com/gb/album/el-erb-single/1536393357">El Erb</a>&rsquo;, is <em>not</em>, I feel sure, Dev, the female singer &amp; rapper of &lsquo;Bass Down Low.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a scunner of a name to search for, what with it being an abbreviation for developer, <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/09/03/on-devs/">the TV show</a>, and Google completely owning the <code>.dev</code> top-level domain.</p>
<p>Multiple people with the same name: it&rsquo;s a problem. It&rsquo;s why actors have <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/about/equity-name/">Equity names</a>, I guess.</p>
<p>Still, there should be no problem with the early nineties <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bis_(Scottish_band)">Scottish indiepoppers Bis</a>, right? Who&rsquo;d have thought they&rsquo;d be back with a new single, this long after &lsquo;The Secret Vampire EP&rsquo;?</p>
<p>No-one, it turns out. This Bis is someone else (and his single &lsquo;<a href="https://music.Apple.com/gb/album/streets/1536096221?i=1536096222">Streets</a>&rsquo; is also nothing to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Streets">The Streets</a>).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It&rsquo;s also hard to search for, not least because it&rsquo;s an abbreviation for several different organisations. I even used to work for a company called BIS.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the English language is running out of names, but if you&rsquo;re planning on using a short one as your professional persona or brand, you probably want to check out whether or not someone has already used it in your field. Though it&rsquo;s not always that
easy, as I&rsquo;ve noted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even a music magazine called <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://clashmusic.com">Clash</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.theclash.com/">The Clash</a>.</p>
<p>Still, &lsquo;Sugar sugar kandy pop/Push it down and pull it up,&rsquo; as I&rsquo;m sure we can all agree.</p>

			 <p>In the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Daniel C Dennett <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/books/review/the-weirdest-people-in-the-world-joseph-henrich.html">reviews</a> a book by Joseph Henrich called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Weirdest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Sounds like an interesting book, and the review itself is engaging. I just wanted to note a few points.</p>
<p>First, we have the acronym WEIRD, which stands for &ldquo;Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic.&rdquo; Apparently being WEIRD makes us weird, in psychological terms. Non-WEIRD and WEIRD people have differences that can be observed, measured.</p>
<p>I was intrigued by this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To point to just one striking example: Normal, meaning non-WEIRD, people use left and right hemispheres of their brains about equally for facial recognition, but we WEIRD people have co-opted left-hemisphere regions for language tasks, and are significantly worse at recognizing faces than the normal population. Until recently few researchers imagined that growing up in a particular culture could have such an effect on functional neuroanatomy.</p>
<p>&ndash; Daniel C Dennett, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/books/review/the-weirdest-people-in-the-world-joseph-henrich.html">Why Are We in the West So Weird? A Theory</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if this can apply on an individual scale: are people whose focus has been language less able to recognise faces? Answering just from within my own head, I&rsquo;d say maybe? I&rsquo;ve been what my Dad used to call a compulsive reader all my life, as well as being at <a href="/categories/cwma/">least somewhat interested in writing</a>, and I&rsquo;m very poor at facial recognition. Bordering on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia">prosopagnosia</a>, I sometimes think (though far from anything like the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-53192821">poor woman in this story</a>, who can&rsquo;t even recognise herself in a mirror).</p>
<p>If my experience suggests that, I have counter examples right in my own family. My beloved and our daughter are both linguists, and both border (to my mind) on being <a href="https://www.associationofsuperrecognisers.org">super recognisers</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, which is the complete opposite of me.</p>
<p>None of which tells us anything useful, except maybe that the ability to recognise faces, like many things, exists on a scale.</p>
<p>More interestingly, Dennett introduces (to me, at least) the delightful term &lsquo;Occam&rsquo;s Broom&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good statistician (which I am not) should scrutinize the many uses of statistics made by Henrich and his team. They are probably all sound but he would want them examined rigorously by the experts. That’s science. Experts who don’t have the technical tools — historians and anthropologists especially — have an important role to play as well; they should scour the book for any instances of Occam’s broom (with which one sweeps inconvenient facts under the rug).</p>
<p>&ndash; Daniel C Dennett, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/books/review/the-weirdest-people-in-the-world-joseph-henrich.html">Why Are We in the West So Weird? A Theory</a></p>

<p>Occam had a famous razor; why wouldn&rsquo;t he have a broom as well?</p>

			 <p>This is a book about history, biography, gender &ndash; and writing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s presented as a biography of the titular character, who starts as the son of a noble family. It&rsquo;s written for, and partly based an the life of, Woolf&rsquo;s friend Vita Sackville-West.</p>
<p>Famously, Orlando&rsquo;s gender (or biological sex) changes partway through the novel. She spends the latter part of it as a woman. She also lives for four or five hundred years &ndash; and presumably is living still. She&rsquo;s barely got started by the end of the book.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The interesting thing about the time difference is that he/she doesn&rsquo;t <em>experience</em> the passage of hundreds of years, as far as we are shown. It&rsquo;s like time passes at a different rate for her. She reaches the age of around 30, but the world has moved on through ages around her.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this greatly, and as I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/08/27/woolf-banks/">said a while back</a>, it sparked some ideas and made me think of associations with Iain Banks. Which can&rsquo;t be bad.</p>

			 <p>Announcing a big life change: I&rsquo;m going to be starting a masters course in a couple of weeks. An <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/study/2020/postgraduate/programmes/TMACWRIT_C">MA in Creative Writing, at Birkbeck, University of London</a>.</p>
<h1 id="nine-months-in-slippers">Nine Months in Slippers</h1>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here, Martin?&rdquo; I hear you ask. Let me take you back to November last year. I lost my job. The reasons are obscure and not that interesting, but I had been working at <a href="https://www.spika.com">SPIKA</a> for only six months, and suddenly I was out on the street.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>If that had happened a couple of months sooner, I might have been studying all this time. I had been vaguely musing on the idea of doing a masters in journalism. I love to write, and I sometimes think that I kind of missed a calling.</p>
<p>I was too late for 2019, all the university terms having already started. So I did a bit of job hunting, but mainly took a break till after Christmas.</p>
<p>When this year that we had no idea was going to be so terrible started, I started looking for jobs, but I also kept thinking about journalism. I started a distance-learning course. Learned a bit of shorthand, and read up on some of the other aspects of the craft. A journalism MA, starting this year, was still on the table.</p>
<p>Then Coronavirus arrived.</p>
<p>To be honest, the lockdown didn&rsquo;t change things that much for me: I was at home all the time anyway. But the jobs market, as well as the rest of the world, was affected. It&rsquo;s easy to work from home in software development, but recruitment was down. I had a few interviews, but no success.</p>
<p>Then somewhere in there I decided that journalism wasn&rsquo;t for me after all. There are aspects of the profession that didn&rsquo;t appeal to me: newsgathering and all that side of it, essentially. I&rsquo;d like to be a columnist or maybe a feature writer, but not so much a reporter. Perhaps more importantly, it&rsquo;s a terrible time for journalism, with newsrooms laying people off and cutting back.</p>
<p>I kept looking for jobs back in software development. But after a bit, Frances said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do a masters in your own field?&rdquo; It was a good idea: it would be intellectually stimulating, and possibly improve my employability. I started looking at courses.</p>
<p>Computer science itself (I&rsquo;ve never formally studied it), or one of the various data science options? Both had their merits. Either would have been interesting and mentally challenging.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/what-does-marie-kondo-mean-when-she-says-spark-joy/">spark joy</a>, to use a tidiness-related term that <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/does-it-spark-joy-is-the-wrong-decluttering-question/">seems appropriate</a>. I looked at the course outlines, and they were interesting enough, but I could tell I wouldn&rsquo;t have <em>loved</em> doing them.</p>
<p>There were other subjects, though, and one kept prodding my mind; one that <em>did</em> offer the prospect of joy, the possibility that I would love it.</p>
<p>Like I said, I love to write.</p>
<h1 id="choosing">Choosing</h1>
<p>Quite a few institutions offer creative writing MAs, in various forms. I applied to all of them. All the ones in London, anyway, and a few others that offer distance learning. Each needed a personal statement and a sample of writing. Every single one had unique requirements of the sample, in terms of word length and type of piece. Royal Holloway, for example (who rejected me), wanted a short story extract and, uniquely, a piece of critical writing. Most just wanted the fiction.</p>
<p>There were differences in the course titles, too. London Met&rsquo;s was &lsquo;<a href="https://www.londonmet.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/creative-digital-and-professional-writing---ma/">Creative, Digital, and Professional Writing</a>.&rsquo; Westminster&rsquo;s was &lsquo;<a href="https://www.westminster.ac.uk/english-and-creative-writing-courses/2020-21/january/full-time/creative-writing-writing-the-city-ma">Creative Writing: Writing the City</a>,&rsquo; though they had closed entry for this year.</p>
<p>City, University of London has several. But the plain &lsquo;<a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/creative-writing">Creative Writing</a>&rsquo; was showing a message to the effect of &lsquo;Applications suspended.&rsquo; I emailed to ask if this meant that they were full for the year, and was told that no, they had suspended entry for 2020 because there wasn&rsquo;t enough interest. So I applied for another one they have, &lsquo;<a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/creative-writing-and-publishing">Creative Writing and Publishing</a>.&rsquo; They got back to me after a few days and said the course was full. Seems to be a slight disconnect there, maybe?</p>
<p>I got offers from London Met, <a href="https://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/creative-writing-distance-learning-ma/">Kingston</a> (by distance learning), and Birkbeck. Birkbeck were the only ones who interviewed me first (I still haven&rsquo;t heard back from several, and Glasgow&rsquo;s website was too broken to let me apply &ndash; and they didn&rsquo;t reply to my query). And just today, <a href="https://www.tees.ac.uk/postgraduate_courses/English_&amp;_Creative_Writing/MA_Creative_Writing_(Online).cfm">Teeside, another distance learning one</a>, offered me a place. Far, far too late. I shouldn&rsquo;t criticise, though, since I was very late in applying.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons I decided Birkbeck was the best of the offers, not least that I liked <a href="https://www.juliabell.net">Julia Bell</a>, the course leader, who interviewed me from her shed. Birkbeck is &lsquo;London&rsquo;s evening university.&rsquo; It was set up to provide adult education to people who are working. All the classes are in the evenings.</p>
<h1 id="why-and-why-now">Why, and Why Now?</h1>
<p>This is probably something I should have done thirty years ago, but we didn&rsquo;t know about masterses back then. Well, I didn&rsquo;t, anyway. And I don&rsquo;t think creative writing masters courses existed at all.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Anyway, as the saying more or less has it, the best time was then; the second-best time is now.</p>
<p>Will it help me be a better writer? I damn well hope so. Beyond that, we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.</p>
<h1 id="and-beyond">And Beyond…</h1>
<p>What comes after this? In an ideal world I&rsquo;ll make my living as a writer. I&rsquo;m well aware how hard that is to achieve, though, so I might end up going back to programming. The best might be some sort of hybrid. We&rsquo;ll see, but I&rsquo;m not going to worry too much about it for the next year or so.</p>
<p>One thing I do plan to do is to blog about the course as I do it, so expect to see more here.</p>

			 <p>John Crace, writing his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> parliamentary sketch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If he was a decent man, he would apologise,” Starmer said. But Boris isn’t a decent man, so he didn’t. Instead he continued to rush on his run.</p>
<p>&ndash; John Crace, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/02/boris-left-flailing-as-pms-limitations-become-clear-for-all-to-see">Boris left flailing as his limitations become clear for all to see</a></p>

<p>Any Velvet Underground fan immediately recognises that as reference to their song &lsquo;Heroin&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I&rsquo;m rushing on my run<br>
And I feel just like Jesus' son<br>
And I guess that I just don&rsquo;t know<br>
And I guess that I just don&rsquo;t know</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if &lsquo;to rush on one&rsquo;s run&rsquo; is a common expression among heroin addicts, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/25/how-i-overcame-my-heroin-addiction-and-started-to-live">John Crace has been there himself</a>, so presumably knows what he&rsquo;s talking about. Is he, then, trying to tell us something about Boris Johnson&rsquo;s predilections?</p>
<p>Perhaps not; perhaps he just means that Johnson&rsquo;s enjoying the high of parliamentary debate, of being in the chamber, of being prime minister. But since the rest of the piece is about what disaster PMQs was for him, that seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Is this one of those open secrets that everyone in Westminster knows, including political journalists, but no-one reveals, because it&rsquo;s not the done thing, old chap?</p>
<p>I do hope not; but we should be told.</p>

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/09/02/on-devs/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-09-02 23:59:44 &#43;0000">Sep 2, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just watched the last episode of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Devs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Several friends recommended it after <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/08/08/150350/">I said &ldquo;What shall we watch next?&quot;</a> a few weeks ago. The question was intended rhetorically, but <a href="https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/1292101937811390464">they gave answers anyway</a>, which was nice.</p>
<p>In terms of its pacing, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Devs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was likened to Kubrick. Fair enough. I saw some Lynchian overtones in it. Or sub-Lynchian, anyway. I enjoyed the journey, but was slightly disappointed with the destination.</p>
<p>Not, however, as disappointed as I feared I was going to be halfway through the last episode. I practically cheered when Lily threw the gun away. But then poetry-quoting Stewart fucked everything up.</p>
<p>Of course, as soon as you (the programme maker) introduce simulations, you (the viewer) can no longer trust that anything is &ldquo;real,&rdquo; so everything gets slippery and to some extent, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>Where it disappoints, I think, is that Forest&rsquo;s incorrect determinism-based view was not actually overturned by the ending. We don&rsquo;t see him and Lily living in an alternative branch of the multiverse, but in a simulation that could be entirely consistent with his belief that reality proceeds on tram tracks &ndash; thereby obviating the guilt he feels for contributing to his wife and child&rsquo;s death, and also getting him off the hook in his mind for his complicity with his murderous ex-CIA security chief.</p>
<p>I found the first episode quite disturbing: the music was screechingly discordant and set my teeth on edge, and that creepy statue towered over everything. And the fact that the statue was still there, still creepy, at the end was confusing. Surely he&rsquo;d only had it built because his daughter died? But in the sim where his daughter survived, it was still there and the company was still named after her. Only Devs (or Deus) the project was missing. Which suggests that he had named the company and had the statue built, not as a commemoration of his daughter, but because &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know, really.</p>
<p>The other weird thing about the first episode was that, not having seen the cast, I spent the first ten minutes saying, &ldquo;Is that Ron Swanson?&rdquo; The fact that one of the first things he says was a complaint about government regulation feels like a clue. Nick Offerman does an impressive job of disappearing into the part, but he couldn&rsquo;t hide his voice.</p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;ll never be able to watch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Parks &amp; Rec<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the same way.</p>
<p>Also Katie, when explaining Devs to Lily, uses &ldquo;reason&rdquo; when she means &ldquo;cause.&rdquo; Her pushing the pen is the <em>cause</em> of it rolling across the table. The <em>reason</em> it happened is because she chose to push it. Reason (to me, at least) implies intelligence or at least sentience behind the action. Cause is the correct word to use when discussing <em>cause</em> and effect.</p>
<p>And when she asked Lily to name a truly random event, Lily should have said, &ldquo;Nuclear decay.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m reading Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Orlando<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at the moment, and enjoying it very much. There&rsquo;s a bit right at the beginning, gruesomely involving a severed head, that I think Iain Banks might have been echoing in <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/08/12/the-algebraist-by-iain-m-banks-books-2018-19/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Algebraist<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> &ndash; considerably more gruesomely.</p>
<p>My bike ride this morning took me to Bloomsbury, Woolf&rsquo;s old area. On my way back, going through Islington, I thought of <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/08/01/walking-on-glass-by-iain-banks-books-2018-18/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Walking on Glass<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>, and I suddenly realised that we have multiple characters walking around there with a lot going on in their heads, which is very similar to what happens in <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/02/mrs-dalloway-by-virginia-woolf-books-2018-25/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mrs Dalloway<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> &ndash; though in Central London</p>
<p>If you follow that link you&rsquo;ll see that I noted the stylistic connection between the two back in 2018, which I had forgotten today.</p>
<p>There have probably been theses written on such parallels.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> And Banks was an English graduate, after all, so he&rsquo;d surely have studied Woolf.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few months ago <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/09/website-changes/">I wrote that I had switched the way my blog was handled</a>. Not just the blog, the entire site, of which the blog has always been only a part. From being a WordPress blog, with a simple static front page, I moved to the whole site being statically generated: written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> and converted into HTML using a tool called <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>.</p>
<p>One of my reasons for doing that was to have control over the tools I use. If I chose one that was written in a language that I know, namely Python, then at the same time as changing my tools, I would have the chance to improve my knowledge of the language.</p>
<p>As you might expect, then, I&rsquo;ve made some contributions to the Nikola project. First I <a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Adevilgate+is%3Aclosed+">fixed a few minor bugs</a>. And now I&rsquo;ve created both a new theme and a new plugin.</p>
<h2 id="blogging-inspirations">Blogging Inspirations</h2>
<p>There are a couple of styles of blogging that have inspired both elements of my own networked writing, and the things I&rsquo;ve contributed. Those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &lsquo;link posts&rsquo; used by John Gruber of <a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> (and others, but I feel Gruber popularised them). In these, the post title becomes the link to the item the blogger is writing about. The blog post&rsquo;s own permalink is also present, but indicated by another element, such as the timestamp. On daring fireball it&rsquo;s the star after the title.</li>
<li>Titleless microblog posts, as popularised by Dave Winer at <a href="http://scripting.com">Scripting News</a>. Again, lots of other people do these too &ndash; not least many on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog </a> &ndash; but Winer was an early and is a continuing advocate.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to be able to use both of these techniques myself, and with only a small fix and some tweaks to template files, I could. But I also wanted to make them first-class citizens of my site, and to make them easily accessible for anyone else who use Nikola. So a theme that handled them well, and a plugin to ease their creation (well, creation of titleless posts) seemed like the way to go.</p>
<h2 id="the-gruberwine-theme">The GruberWine Theme</h2>
<p>Given the inspirations, I named my theme &lsquo;GruberWine&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s available in the <a href="https://themes.getnikola.com">Nikola theme repository</a>. The <a href="https://themes.getnikola.com/v8/gruberwine/">details are here</a>. It&rsquo;s based visually on another theme, called <a href="https://themes.getnikola.com/v8/zen-jinja/">zen-jinja</a>, but I made a lot of changes to the CSS.</p>
<h2 id="the-nikola-micro-plugin">The Nikola Micro Plugin</h2>
<p>Nikola provides a command-line tool for creating posts: <code>nikola new_post</code>. But that makes you enter a title. You can tweak things afterwards to remove the title, but if you know up front that your post won&rsquo;t have one, you can now use my &lsquo;Micro&rsquo; plugin, by running <code>nikola micro</code>. The <a href="https://plugins.getnikola.com/v8/micro/">details are here</a> in the <a href="https://plugins.getnikola.com">plugin repository</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This short novel feels surprisingly modern. Indeed, maybe it&rsquo;s modern<em>ist</em>. It was written in the fifties, and is set in the thirties. The modern part is mainly the way it plays with time. Starting at a point and then flashing back is simple enough, but then we get various flashforwards and explanations of what&rsquo;s going to happen to the various characters. It&rsquo;s all very elegantly done, with the changes smoothly integrated, so they don&rsquo;t feel like jumps at all.</p>
<p>Jean Brodie is a teacher, and kind of an educational reformer, in that she thinks her students should be taught a broad array of things, and should learn about the world, rather than just follow a narrow, fixed curriculum. She would never &ldquo;teach to the test&rdquo; &ndash; which phrase is never used, but Brodie would be strongly against that modern malaise.</p>
<p>But she very much plays favourites. Her &ldquo;set&rdquo; get all her attention (outside of school as well as in it), and all the other pupils &ndash; those who have no chance of becoming &ldquo;la crème de la crème&rdquo; &ndash; are ignored. She is, ultimately, exceedingly self-centred.</p>
<p>Notoriously, she also has exceedingly dodgy &ndash; or maybe just deeply naive &ndash; political views. Here is Sandy, the main viewpoint character, when Brodie has shown the class a picture of Mussolini and his <em>fascisti</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They were dark as anything and all marching in the straightest of files, with their hands raised at the same angle, while Mussolini stood on a platform like a gym teacher or a Guides mistress and watched them. Mussolini had put an end to unemployment with his fascisti and there was no litter in the streets. It occurred to Sandy, there at the end of the Middle Meadow Walk, that the Brodie set was Miss Brodie’s fascisti, not to the naked eye, marching along, but all knit together for her need and in another way, marching along. That was all right, but it seemed, too, that Miss Brodie’s disapproval of the Girl Guides had jealousy in it, there was an inconsistency, a fault. Perhaps the Guides were too much a rival fascisti, and Miss Brodie could not bear it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gets worse, though, when she:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>was going abroad, not to Italy this year but to Germany, where Hitler was become Chancellor, a prophet-figure like Thomas Carlyle, and more reliable than Mussolini; the German brownshirts, she said, were exactly the same as the Italian black, only more reliable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She sees the error of her ways, though, after a fashion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the war Miss Brodie admitted to Sandy, as they sat in the Braid Hills Hotel, “Hitler <strong>was</strong> rather naughty.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She has some more positive views, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We of Edinburgh owe a lot to the French. We are Europeans.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*Sigh*</p>
<p>But my favourite quotes involve religion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lloyds were Catholics and so were made to have a lot of children by force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And getting back to those Fascisti:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By now she had entered the Catholic Church, in whose ranks she had found quite a number of Fascists much less agreeable than Miss Brodie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sad story, in the end. Worth reading, though.</p>

			 <p>Amused by <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/19.html#a154053">Dave Winer&rsquo;s comment</a>: &ldquo;can&rsquo;t stand podcasts with advertising.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m far from a lover of advertising, but podcast advertising is, to me the best kind. Or the least-bad kind, anyway. I use <a href="https://www.linode.com">Linode</a>, and <a href="https://textexpander.com">TextExpander</a>, and <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a>, and <a href="https://www.hover.com">Hover</a>&hellip; all because I first heard about them on podcasts (and/or because I got discounts on them from podcast ads).</p>
<p>But maybe that&rsquo;s a particular kind of podcast, or a particular kind of ad. They tend to be independents or small companies like <a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay FM</a>; ads that are read by the presenter, in their own voice &ndash; sometimes, though not always, in their own words. (Sometimes not their words, <a href="https://www.relay.fm/rocket">but weirded up</a>.)</p>
<p>Dave goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s even worse is podcasts with advertising with the proceeds going to charity. WTF goes through their minds. Why do they even bother.</p>
<p>&ndash; Dave Winer, <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/19.html#a154053">Untitled</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure what he&rsquo;s talking about there.</p>
<p>What I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> like is adverts that are injected separately from the body of the podcast. Another voice cuts in (or precedes, or concludes), talking about something irrelevant. Those ones are comparable with TV advertising, and I always skip them.</p>

			 <p>I got back on the bike today. First time since <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/04/07/the-last-bike-ride/">I came off back in April</a>. Both because I felt the need to add some variety to my exercise regime, and because <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/05/27/234242/">so many people are riding</a> these days. And also because I missed it.</p>
<p>It was good. Nice to be back on the bike. A bit annoying the way the mask makes your glasses steam up, but nothing that a bit of slipstream couldn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>But it was very disappointing regarding people&rsquo;s behaviour. I cycled around central Hackney for half an hour or so from about 9-9:30. It was pretty busy.</p>
<p>I counted 11 people wearing masks (and two chin-wearers, so they don&rsquo;t count). I must have passed about 500 people? 700? That&rsquo;s just a guess, but it was a lot.</p>
<p>Eleven masks.</p>
<p>My mask was protecting all of them: why weren&rsquo;t they protecting me, and each other?</p>
<p>I mainly blame the government, of course. Incoherent messaging and absence of care. But&hellip; <em>some</em> of us have learned what&rsquo;s best, even given the government.</p>

			 <p>My 2020 reading reaches 20, which is pleasing. And with another novella, which is something of a theme.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/02/25/sourdough-by-robin-sloan-books-2018-3/">read Sloan&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sourdough<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a couple of years back</a>, and only thought it was OK, but I still get his newsletter, which is where I learned about this. It was originally serialised in a San Francisco Bay Area newspaper,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and published via an <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/books/annabel-scheme-serial/">interesting experiment with online writing</a>, and a new <a href="http://github.com/robinsloan/perfect-edition">software package for publishing books on the web</a>.</p>
<p>That said, I read it on my Kindle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. Lots of fun, even if you don&rsquo;t know the Bay Area. A detective and her assistant try to stop multiple timelines being crashed together. But it starts with burritos. What&rsquo;s not to like?</p>
<p>One unusual thing is that the assistant, who is also the narrator (a veritable Doyle, though not as useful) never has any quoted speech. You&rsquo;ll get an exchange like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wondered if Scheme had worked up any theories.</p>
<p>“Sure. Most likely explanation is, Stella Pajunas was never real to start with. Ectoplasmic projection. Mass hallucination, maybe.”</p>
<p>Scheme was theorizing that the ABCD—really, the whole Bay Area—had been managed for ten years by a mass hallucination?</p>
<p>“It would explain some things, wouldn’t it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A piece of narration is answered by the other character. The implication is that the narrator said it. I don&rsquo;t recall ever seeing this in fiction, but it is used in some interviews. It used to be the norm in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NME<!-- raw HTML omitted --> back when I read it. In interviews, I much prefer that technique to the purely transcriptional approach, which can look like a play script at times. As to using it in fiction, it works well enough here, in such a short work, but I think it would get wearing at greater length.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can read it for free, so you might as well.</p>

			 <p>This has been sitting around in my drafts folder for about a month, so it&rsquo;s long past time to get it out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://hey.com">HEY</a> (they always capitalise it, which I don&rsquo;t care for) is a new email service from <a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, makers of fine (I’m told) collaboration software for teams. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI">The video walkthrough</a> lasts about half an hour, but/and gives you a good overview of what it’s like.</p>
<p>Hey was also in the news recently over the way Apple was treating it regarding App Store rules. Apple were clearly in the wrong, and things have been sorted out now.</p>
<p>But that’s all another story. I want to talk about Hey, and why I think it is bad for users. Even at the same time that it’s probably <em>good</em> for users. A company, a service, can — like a person — contain multitudes.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>If you watch that video you’ll see that Hey looks like an unusually interesting and capable email client: good for organising mail, getting the unimportant stuff out of your way until you want to look at it, and making the important things highly visible. It’s both powerful at automatically helping the user, and attractive to look at.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>But it’s built on a proprietary platform. Email’s biggest strength since its invention has been that it was built on open standards. Whether you were using a Unix command-line client at a university in the early days, or Gmail, Outlook, or another IMAP provider today — none of that matters. If you know someone’s email address, you can contact them, and they you. And more importantly for this discussion: if you want to use different email client software, you can.</p>
<p>That’s because email is built on <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Protocol">open protocols</a></em>: SMTP, POP, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">IMAP</a>. Not that you have to understand those &ndash; or even know about them &ndash; to use email, any more than you have to understand an internal combustion engine to drive a car.</p>
<p>More importantly, if you want to change from one email provider to another, you can do so. This is harder than it should be because the culture of people having their own domain never really caught on. All those <code>josmith1989@gmail.com</code> and <code>hazy_harriet@hotmail.com</code> type of addresses could, instead, have been <code>jo@josmith1989.net</code> and <code>harri@hazyharriet.org</code>.</p>
<p>They still could be, in fact. And when they are, then you can change the underlying email provider without anyone other than yourself having to know or care. To take a not-made-up example, <code>martin@devilgate.org</code> used to go by a complex combination of Gmail (for the spam filtering and search) and <code>5quidhost.co.uk</code> and its eventual purchaser, TSOHost, because that’s what I used for web hosting, as much as anything else. But a few years ago I switched it to <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>. No-one I correspond with had to know anything about the change.</p>
<p>But Hey’s email service does not use the open protocols — principally IMAP — that makes all that possible. Instead they have their own proprietary system. If you move your email into Hey’s service, you might not find it too easy to move it out again.</p>
<p>Secondly, right now they don’t support custom domains, so your correspondents will certainly have to know. While <code>josmith@hey.com</code> might be available right now, if they have any success we’ll soon be back to appending birth years or random numbers to the end of common names, just like on Gmail, Hotmail, etc. Though they have said they intend to support custom domains, so there’s scope for a better solution there.</p>
<h2 id="the-alternatives">The Alternatives</h2>
<p><a href="https://canion.me">Andrew Canion</a> had the same thought I did when I watched the video: you can do most of this in <a href="https://freron.com">MailMate</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> At least the viewing, the &lsquo;The Feed&rsquo; kind of thing. Though he had the added experience of using <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/">SaneBox</a> to automatically file and sort your emails.</p>
<p>Andrew also went further than I did: instead of just thinking, &lsquo;I could do that with MailMate,&rsquo; he went ahead and did it, and <a href="https://canion.blog/2020/06/16/replicating-heycom-features.html">documented the process</a> (with a <a href="https://canion.blog/2020/06/17/addendum-replicating-heycom.html">tiny bit of help from yours truly</a>).</p>
<p>I had heard of SaneBox through its sponsoring of various podcasts, so I was familiar with the idea, but I hadn’t tried it. I’m now trying it out, along with some of Andrew’s suggestions, and it’s altogether a pretty good setup. Now, all that comes into my main inbox — the only things that appear on unread counts, and hence activate icon badges — are actual emails that I want to see. All the newsletters, receipts, confirmations, and other stuff that isn’t spam but that I don’t want appearing in my inbox, and especially in my unread count — those are all there, but tidily away in other mailboxes, where I can deal with them at my leisure.</p>
<p>That said, SaneBox is not free (though it’s cheaper than Hey), and I don’t get <em>that</em> much annoying email. So I don’t think I’ll continue with this exact setup when the free trial ends. But it’s worth knowing that there are good ways — and standards-compliant ways — to achieve similar functionality to Hey’s.</p>
<h2 id="we-built-this-city-on-imap">We Built This City on IMAP</h2>
<p>What this all shows is that there’s nothing in Hey’s service that you couldn’t create by building on top of IMAP, except the user interface &ndash; and that doesn’t have to know about the underlying protocols in any case. It&rsquo;s possible that is exactly what they <em>have</em> done: implemented it on top of IMAP. In fact, doing anything else would mean giving themselves a lot of extra work, as they would have to effectively reinvent IMAP in any case.</p>
<p>If I were going to build a service like Hey, I’d start with an off-the-shelf IMAP service, probably open source, and build the filtering rules and all that around it.</p>
<p>So I hope that’s what they have done, and that at some point in the future they make their service available to ordinary email clients via IMAP.</p>

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/07/16/the-angel-of-the-crows/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-07-16 15:33:05 &#43;0000">Jul 16, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I read about this in a <a href="https://www.tor.com/2020/07/02/jack-the-ripper-is-probably-the-sff-killer-youre-looking-for/">Tor.com article about the use of Jack the Ripper in fiction</a>. It&rsquo;s a story set in Victorian times, about two men living Baker Street in London; one a detective, the other a doctor.</p>
<p>But the detective is an angel, called Crow; and the doctor is JH Doyle, recently back from Afghanistan, where he was injured in an encounter with one of the Fallen. And someone is murdering women in Whitechapel.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s an interesting riff on the Sherlock Holmes stories. The hunt for the Ripper is spread through the whole book, while some of the well-known cases have versions interspersed. The Sign of the Four appears, Baskerville Hall is visited. When someone dies and the only visible wound is twin puncture marks, was it a snake, as in &lsquo;The Speckled Band,&rsquo; or a vampire?</p>
<p>Because most of the creatures of myth and legend exist in this London, often with an unusual twist. James Moriarty can&rsquo;t enter your home unless you invite him. But werewolves are respected landlords.</p>
<p>Vampires can enter public buildings, of course: &ldquo;Any building with an angel.&rdquo; Angels only have consciousness and names &ndash; names are important &ndash; if they are attached to a public building. Churches and synagogues have their angels, obviously; but so too do pubs, hotels, and stations. The angel of King&rsquo;s Cross makes an appearance.</p>
<p>But not the angel I was half expecting. The Angel, Islington is a pub,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and we&rsquo;d have to refer to its angel as &lsquo;The Angel of the Angel, Islington,&rsquo; which would be weird and unwieldy.</p>
<p>Speaking of language, the Victorianism is handled pretty well, I think, but the author is American, and it shows where a few terms creep in. &lsquo;Sidewalk&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;pavement&rsquo;; &lsquo;baseboard&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;skirting board.&rsquo; &lsquo;Row houses&rsquo; where we would say &lsquo;terraced houses.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sundown.&rsquo; &lsquo;Paper folded into fourths&rsquo;; a British writer would say &lsquo;quarters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These are mildly jarring, but not that important. Certainly not enough to detract from the fun of the story overall.</p>

			 <p>The growth of email newsletters over the last few years has been interesting. But they have a major problem, compared to blogs.</p>
<p>That is, once they&rsquo;ve been sent out, the author can&rsquo;t fix typos. Other errors can be corrected in later issues, but typos are out there forever.</p>

<p>The prime minister has set up a taskforce to devise plans for how ministers can regain much of the direct control over the NHS they lost in 2012 under a controversial shake-up masterminded by Andrew Lansley, the then coalition government health secretary.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s Health and Social Care Taskforce – made up of senior civil servants and advisers from Downing Street, the Treasury and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) – is drawing up proposals that would restrict NHS England’s operational independence and the freedom Stevens has to run the service.</p>

<p>Dear Martin McCallion,</p>
<p>You recently signed the petition “Make it mandatory to wear a face mask in public during Covid-19 Pandemic”:

<p>The Petitions Committee (the group of MPs who oversee the petitions system) have considered the Government’s response to this petition. They felt that the response did not directly address the request of petition and have therefore written back to the Government to ask them to provide a revised response.</p>
<p>When the Committee have received a revised response from the Government, this will be published on the website and you will receive an email. If you would not like to receive further updates about this petition, you can unsubscribe below.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
The Petitions team<br>

<p>The Cold War continues. And Trump&rsquo;s on the Russian side of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The intelligence finding was briefed to President Trump, and the White House’s National Security Council discussed the problem at an interagency meeting in late March, the officials said. Officials developed a menu of potential options — starting with making a diplomatic complaint to Moscow and a demand that it stop, along with an escalating series of sanctions and other possible responses, but the White House has yet to authorize any step, the officials said.</p>

			 <p>This has won all the awards, and rightly so. Or not quite all: it&rsquo;s a finalist for the Hugo novella award. At the time of writing, we don&rsquo;t know whether or not it will win.</p>
<p>Unless I&rsquo;ve travelled downthread and found out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a novella, which may be the perfect length of story, in some sense. It&rsquo;s a love story across time and space and multiple parallel existences&hellip; It&rsquo;s pure dead brilliant.</p>
<p>The actual nature of the war, of the sides, even of the protagonists, Red and Blue, is ambiguous at best. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter because the writing is so exquisite.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_How_You_Lose_the_Time_War">Wikipedia article</a> describes it as an epistolary novel. That&rsquo;s only partly true, and not just because it&rsquo;s a novella. The letters are there, and are fundamental, but I feel that to be truly &lsquo;epistolary,&rsquo; the whole story must be told in letters, and that is not the case here. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>One minor oddity I alluded to above: The future is referred to as &lsquo;downthread&rsquo; and the past &lsquo;upthread.&rsquo; That seems the wrong way round to me, but maybe it reflects the fact that, normally, we can&rsquo;t stop sliding down into the future.</p>
<p>Go. Get. Read. VVG. They&rsquo;re adapting it for TV. I can&rsquo;t quite imagine what that will look like, but I&rsquo;m keen to find out.</p>

			 <p>Friday Baldwin is genetically engineered &lsquo;artificial person.&rsquo; Indistinguishable from a conventional human, she nonetheless is psychologically constrained by the way her society discriminates against her type.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much her only constraint, though. Her engineered nature also gives her enhanced strength, reflexes, sight, hearing, and smell, as well as genius-level intelligence. She starts out as a courier and soon becomes a fugitive.</p>
<p>This stands up pretty well, all these years since I first read it. The fragmented, Balkanised future North America is interesting. Easy travel everywhere by &lsquo;tubes,&rsquo; which are presumably underground trains, and suborbital rockets. Corruption so pervasive that the characters don&rsquo;t even notice it.

<p><a href="https://colinwalker.blog/15-06-2020-1528/">Colin Walker links</a> to a <a href="https://jusummerhayes.livejournal.com/655972.html">post by Julian Summerhayes</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> about silence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see, I&rsquo;m missing the silence of early lockdown.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m really missing it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say everything&rsquo;s back to normal but as soon as I step outside, BOOM, there it is! That infernal, torrid background noise, cars everywhere (the air smells dirty) and it&rsquo;s like nothing ever happened.</p>
<p>&ndash; Julian Summerhayes, <a href="https://jusummerhayes.livejournal.com/655972.html">A quiet space</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can relate. I haven&rsquo;t noticed the increased noise yet, but I have been enjoying much about lockdown, and the general quietness of things, especially when I sit out in the garden, is part of that. As is the cleaner air here in London.</p>
<h2 id="unthinkable-thoughts">Unthinkable Thoughts</h2>
<p>But Julian goes on to say something that just seems so bizarre, so alien to me, that I can scarcely comprehend it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when you realise that <strong>you&rsquo;re not your thoughts</strong>, notwithstanding the apparent hold they have over us, and see that they flow naturally much like my beloved River Dart and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to orientate them one way or the other, life becomes a lot easier.</p>
<p>&ndash; Julian Summerhayes, <a href="https://jusummerhayes.livejournal.com/655972.html">A quiet space</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis very much mine. We are not our thoughts? I can&rsquo;t help but think that there&rsquo;s a missing pair of words in that sentence: &lsquo;nothing if&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; you&rsquo;re nothing if not your thoughts&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that makes a lot more sense to me. If we are not our thoughts, then what are we? If our thoughts are not us, then who is doing the thinking?</p>
<p>People sometimes use phrasing like, &lsquo;My brain told me to&hellip;&rsquo;, which raises the same question: you <em>are</em> your brain, surely? If not, then what? We are our whole bodies, certainly, and perception and experience encompass all of our physiology, not <em>just</em> our brains. But the brain is the seat of consciousness, and we are conscious beings.</p>
<p>Perhaps &ndash; just possibly &ndash; people are making a distinction between brain and mind. Maybe that would make sense for the latter formulation, but I&rsquo;m not convinced that&rsquo;s it. And certainly it doesn&rsquo;t explain Julian&rsquo;s concept of <em>thoughts</em>. Because whether thoughts happen in the physical organ we call <em>brain</em>, or the somewhat more metaphysical and amorphous <em>mind</em>: thoughts are what we <em>are</em>.</p>
<h2 id="in-other-heads">In Other Heads</h2>
<p>Or so it seems to me. But I shouldn&rsquo;t dismiss alternative perceptions. Over the last few months I&rsquo;ve heard several conversations on podcasts, and read a couple of articles, about the different ways people&rsquo;s brains/minds/psyches/consciousnesses work.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia">aphantasia</a>, which names the fact that some people do not form images in their minds. They have no &lsquo;mind&rsquo;s eye,&rsquo; in effect. Just yesterday I read <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-purpose.html">an article about it and severely deficient autobiographical memory</a>, or SDAM, which seems to be related.</p>
<p>There has also been talk about whether or not we think in words. That can get confusing when people with different experiences discuss &lsquo;the voice in your head.&rsquo; One will ask something like, &lsquo;Whose voice is it?&rsquo; The answer &ndash; from my perspective &ndash; is that the voice in my head <em>is</em> my thoughts. That&rsquo;s how I think. Hmm, except when I think in pictures, as I&rsquo;m not aphantasic (aphantastic?)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to talk about these ideas in ways that someone whose experience is dramatically different will understand. And I find it surprising that we <em>are</em> so different. I wonder if we are just hitting the limitations of language (of English, at least). Maybe people&rsquo;s experiences are not <em>that</em> different, but it&rsquo;s just so hard to describe what goes on inside your own head in a way that is meaningful inside someone else&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Or not. After all, some people <em>do</em> hear voices in their heads which appear not to be their own. We generally categorise those people as having a mental illness, and sometimes medication changes their mental experience. And of course psychoactive drugs cause us to have experiences in our own heads that are different from our normal state, so it&rsquo;s clear that thoughts and perceptions are at least partly chemical.</p>
<p>This is all both fascinating and confusing, and I have no conclusions about it.</p>

			 <p>I should probably start a special tag for all this Heinlein rereading I&rsquo;m doing (I	 have another one in progress). These books are so short that they hardly count as one novel <em>between</em> them, never mind each, but I&rsquo;m counting them as two because I have two physically separate books.</p>
<p>Plus they&rsquo;re not only not one novel, they&rsquo;re not even two. They are, in fact, four stories &ndash; the longest no more than a novella &ndash; loosely connected by the idea that humans don&rsquo;t use all of their brain power, and we could do incredible things if we did.</p>
<p>Oh, and an early analysis of what it is to be human, and whether human rights should be accorded to uplifted intelligent animals.</p>
<p>All in all, a good enough, if slight, set of stories.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A set of linked short stories, this, all part of Heinlein&rsquo;s Future History. In these days of companies launching rockets to the International Space Station, the title story seems slightly relevant. In it, businessman DD Harriman attempts to launch the first mission to the moon &ndash; it was written in the 40s, long before Apollo.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all decent enough stories. But we are in a very masculine world. The dodgy sexual politics of <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/05/31/beyond-this-horizon-by-robert-a-heinlein-books-2020-10/">the last one</a> are largely ignored by the almost complete absence of women. Except in &lsquo;Let There Be Light,&rsquo; in which a women is effectively co-inventor of solar power panels.</p>
<p>Heinlein&rsquo;s writing of women characters is generally considered to be poor, and I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s true. But it&rsquo;s interesting to think how he developed from these early stories to the later novels, where at least there <em>are</em> women, and they are major characters.</p>

			 <p>I hope I don&rsquo;t need to say this. But silence is complicity, so:</p>
<p><strong>Black Lives Matter.</strong></p>
<p>My daughter went to the London demo on Wednesday (note: there was no riot, contrary to some bullshit hashtag that was trending yesterday morning). I am <em>so</em> proud of her. Her whole generation seem so thoughtful, so engaged.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t I go? To be honest, it&rsquo;s because I was scared. Not of the demo, or anything that might have happened there. I was scared of the virus. Of the close contact that was sure to happen.</p>
<p>I gave her a lift to her friend&rsquo;s house. They walked for two and a half hours to Hyde Park. I picked her up in Camden afterwards. But part of me wishes I&rsquo;d gone myself. She said it was a much younger crowd than the <a href="/blog/2018/07/15/trumping-through-london/">Trump</a> or <a href="/blog/2018/10/22/march-in-october/">Brexit</a> demos.

<p>Got to ask, why doesn&rsquo;t the BBC make this available officially?</p>
<p>I have only one complaint about that page: it needs use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words">stop-words</a> in its sorting, or otherwise deal with bands called &lsquo;The&rsquo; Something.

<p>Also, it would be even better if we had Peelie&rsquo;s introductions, but I guess those aren&rsquo;t in the released versions.</p>

			 <p>I like these short books you can read in a day.</p>
<p>A reread, of course. I read most or all of Heinlein from my early days of reading SF. But I read the blurb on the back of this and didn&rsquo;t recognise it at all. Started reading, and it still wasn&rsquo;t familiar.</p>
<p>Then as I got closer to the end, it <em>did</em> start to seem familiar. Did I read the last quarter of it recently? Or is there a short-story version of part of it that I read not long ago? I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s often strange how memory works.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first point about this: the sexual politics are <em>horrific</em>. It&rsquo;s a future society where men go armed routinely &ndash; and so it is a &lsquo;polite&rsquo; society. It may be where the phrase &lsquo;an armed society is a polite society&rsquo; comes from. I wonder what Heinlein (assuming that to be his actual view) would think of today&rsquo;s armed society in America.</p>
<p>Women, on the other hand, do <em>not</em> go armed, or do much else apart from be decorative and have babies. Mostly. One woman character wears a sidearm, but the protagonist does not exactly treat her with the respect he gives to other men.</p>
<p>Men can choose not to go armed, in which case they have to wear the &lsquo;Brassard of peace,&rsquo; and are treated as second-class citizens by the armed &lsquo;braves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not mainly about any of that. It&rsquo;s about eugenics, and how and whether it&rsquo;s possible to improve the human race ethically.</p>
<p>In story terms it&rsquo;s OK. It&rsquo;s interesting enough that you want to know what happens, but it feels like its main purpose in existing is to examine the philosophical questions around eugenics. I note that it was published in 1942, so before the Nazis' experiments were known about.</p>

			 <p>The last Brookmyre I read was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pandaemonium<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2010/09/08/summer-reading-2010/">in 2010</a>. Before that, his first, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quite Ugly One Morning<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, before I started writing here. The second of those introduced campaigning journalist Jack Parlabane. There&rsquo;s another one before this, but you don&rsquo;t need to read them in order. There are also a stack more.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Anyway, what&rsquo;s it like? No bad, as we say in Scotland. It starts off with Parlabane in prison. Part of the story, including how he ended up there, is told in flashback. It&rsquo;s all set in the early days of the new Scottish Parliament, around 2000, 2001.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a decent page turner, I can&rsquo;t deny. My main criticism in writerly terms is about the old &lsquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell,&rsquo; thing, which we&rsquo;ve <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2011/06/09/tell-and-maybe-show-as-well/">discussed</a> here <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2015/10/06/the-three-body-problem-by-cixin-liu-translated-by-ken-liu-books-2015-9/">before</a>.</p>
<p>In at least one of those pieces I counsel against setting that injunction in stone. But it&rsquo;s notable how much of this novel violates or ignores it. For large chunks of the flashbacks we&rsquo;re told what happens. It&rsquo;s fine. The writing style flows and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like infodumps, but I was certainly aware of it.</p>
<p>Worth reading. I&rsquo;ll probably read more of him, eventually. Still looking for a sequel to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pandaemonium<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, though.</p>

			 <p>Dr John Lee, writing in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Spectator<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (paywall, but free access to a few articles), explains what pathologists do, and goes on to say:</p>

<p>We are still struggling to understand coronavirus. I can think of no time in my medical career when it has been more important to have accurate diagnosis of a disease, and understanding of precisely why patients have died of it. Yet very early on in the epidemic, rules surrounding death certification were changed — in ways that make the statistics unreliable.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve moved from needing two doctors to certify death, to only one <em>if the cause is believed to be Covid-19</em>. And sometimes the &lsquo;cause&rsquo; is decided from a statement from care-home staff, who are not usually trained medical professionals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So at a time when accurate death statistics are more important than ever, the rules have been changed in ways that make them less reliable than ever. In what proportion of Covid-19 ‘mentions’ was the disease actually present? And in how many cases, if actually present, was Covid-19 responsible for death? Despite what you may have understood from the daily briefings, the shocking truth is that we just don’t know. How many of the excess deaths during the epidemic are due to Covid-19, and how many are due to our societal responses of healthcare reorganisation, lockdown and social distancing? Again, we don’t know. Despite claims that they’re all due to Covid-19, there’s strong evidence that many, perhaps even a majority, are the result of our responses rather than the disease itself.</p>

			 <p>I decided I needed something SF-y that I knew I&rsquo;d enjoy: a reread, in other words. Something with spaceships. Prowling my shelves, this is what I came to. No spaceships, but fast skateboards and faster motorbikes, katanas and glass knives; and of course, the Metaverse.</p>
<p>I was struck by how little of it I remembered, but it is something like 26 years since I read it (published 1992, so I&rsquo;m guessing I read it in 94 or so).</p>
<p>Hiro Protagonist, the fantastically-named hero, is a hacker.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> He&rsquo;s also the greatest samurai swordsman alive, supposedly. And he&rsquo;s delivering pizzas for the Mafia. Which fact is the first view we have of how the world &ndash; or at least America &ndash; has changed. There is almost no government, no laws; and everything is split up into &lsquo;burbclaves&rsquo; and franchises, run by companies, churches, or criminal organisations.</p>
<p>But there is the Metaverse. Nothing we have today is close to what it is like, but it&rsquo;s what virtual reality wants to be, and maybe will be one day.</p>
<p>The internet is everywhere (which of course wasn&rsquo;t the case when it was written). Though phoneboxes still exist, and using them is one way to get into the Metaverse. And if you want mobile access, you have to &lsquo;go gargoyle.&rsquo; Which is to say, wear your special goggles and carry a computer around with you, strapped to your body. There are mobile phones, but the conversion of them into pocket computers is <em>not</em> something that Stephenson foresaw. Or at least, not something he made use of here.</p>
<h2 id="the-ending">The Ending</h2>
<p>I had the impression that everyone thought that early Stephenson had problems with endings. I mean, I had that impression myself, and <a href="/blog/2007/01/21/book-notes-23-quicksilver-by-neal-stephenson/">have alluded to it here before</a>. And I thought that this was one with a slightly weak ending.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t at all. The bit that I remembered &ndash; the climax that takes place in the Metaverse &ndash; comes at the end of a tense chase/fight sequence, and while it depicts a scene that might be anticlimactic for the people in-universe who witness it, it&rsquo;s fully satisfying and sound to us, the readers. Then the last couple of chapters wind things up neatly back in the outer world.</p>
<p>The criticism that might be levelled at it, especially in SF terms, is that we don&rsquo;t see how the world has been changed by the events of the story. But I think that can easily be left to our imaginations.</p>
<p>A genuine classic.</p>

She was 81. That&rsquo;s not a bad age, and it&rsquo;s not like I had followed her career. I just knew her as a photographer who had worked with The Beatles, and been Stuart Sutcliffe&rsquo;s partner till he died.</p>
<p>But from my early reading of Beatles books &ndash; like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_An_Illustrated_Record"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Beatles: An Illustrated Record<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> &ndash; onward, I was aware of her as part of their story, their mythology.</p>
<p>More than that, though, as the article above, as well as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/17/astrid-kirchherr-obituary">her obituary</a>, will tell you: she was the one who gave them their early look. She made them the &ldquo;lovable moptops.&rdquo; They&rsquo;d have been successful without the haircuts, of course, but there&rsquo;s no denying the importance of that early image.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m saddened more because of what her death represents. I was born the year The Beatles took America. They had long split up by the time I developed any musical awareness.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But they were the first band I really got interested in, when my sister gave me a tape. They were my favourites until punk came along, and I love them still.</p>
<p>But that whole generation is ageing &ndash; well, who isn&rsquo;t, of course &ndash; and will soon be gone. And mine not too far behind it. So what it all comes down to is that Astrid&rsquo;s death reminds me of my own mortality, and there&rsquo;s no excuse for that!</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t know whether people know about this iOS feature. I discovered it by accident a year or two back. Before that I used to snooze my alarms by drowsily scrabbling for my phone, prying my eyes open, then trying to tap the correct onscreen button.</p>
<p>Then one morning the alarm was too loud &ndash; or it might have been too quiet, I don&rsquo;t recall &ndash; and I tried to change the volume. When I pressed the volume button, the alarm instantly stopped. I thought I had cancelled it by accident, until it rang again the customary nine minutes later.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve always snoozed my alarms that way. But nearly every time I do, I think, &ldquo;Do people know about this feature?&rdquo; Because I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen it written down.

<p>I had thought that pressing the power button cancelled the alarm, rather than snoozing it, but I just checked, and it <em>also</em> snoozes it. So if you reach out, eyes closed, and press <em>anything</em> on the side of your iPhone, you&rsquo;ll get another nine minutes.</p>
<p>In the interest of fully informing you, dear reader, I&rsquo;ve just checked what the Home button does; and it appears that <em>does</em> cancel the alarm. So keep your presses to the sides.</p>
<p>I should note that I <a href="/blog/2017/07/11/great-new-phone-all-the-wrong-reasons/">still</a> have an iPhone 7. I&rsquo;ve no reason to believe the behaviour is significantly different on more recent models, but obviously on the 10-series phones (X, XR, XS and the various 11s) you don&rsquo;t have the Home button, so something different might happen. Let me know if you find out.</p>

			 <p>Not to blow my own trumpet, but I made these rolls today. They are the closest thing I&rsquo;ve ever had this side of Scotland to the rolls I grew up with.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I used <a href="https://foodanddrink.scotsman.com/food/the-history-of-glasgow-morning-rolls-including-a-recipe-for-making-your-own/">this recipe</a> that was published in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Scotsman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It involves overnight fermentation in the fridge, and the trick to getting the crispy outside is coating them with a mixture of plain flour and rice flour before baking.</p>
<p>Main problem is 500g of flour makes only eight rolls! And it&rsquo;s kinda hard to get bread flour at the moment.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m almost beginning to wish I hadn&rsquo;t switched my site to static generation. Not really, though. I&rsquo;m very pleased with the way the site is performing, with how it looks, and with how easy it is to change things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the <em>non</em>-static parts that I want to get working that are complex. By which I mean comments, of course, and Webmentions.</p>
<p>Comments are obvious. And the &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; way to make them work with a static site &ndash; and one that has good support built into <a href="https://getnikola.com">Nikola</a>, the generator application I&rsquo;m using &ndash; is <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. But Disqus is known to track its users and show ads, and I don&rsquo;t want that for anyone who might comment here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been trying other options. But none of them work as easily as you&rsquo;d hope. There are always complexities, difficulties, bits you have to glue together or even build yourself.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve tried:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://posativ.org/isso/">Isso</a>: you have to run a service on your site. I couldn&rsquo;t get the service to respond.</li>
<li><a href="https://staticman.net/">Staticman</a>: I couldn&rsquo;t get its service to start. A problem with configuring the private key setting.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.remarkbox.com/">Remarkbox</a>: at the time of writing this is still active, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll keep it. It works like Disqus, in that the comments are hosted on a third-party site, which is not really in keeping with the whole static site/indieweb ethos. It&rsquo;s not advertising driven like Disqus, but it behaves a bit strangely, at least on here. We&rsquo;ll see, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of blogs manage without comments, of course, including many of the most successful and long-running ones. But I&rsquo;ve always had a fondness for them. They were building communities online long before there was a Facebook or a Twitter.</p>
<p>The other way to join the conversation is to send and accept <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmentions</a>. I won&rsquo;t try to explain those here, but again, there&rsquo;s a certain amount of infrastructure needed to get them working, and I&rsquo;m not quite there yet.</p>
<p>Still, it all means I&rsquo;m learning things, which is good. And my posts and pages are just text files, which is as they should be.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s good when you can repair things. We had a problem with the switch on the kettle the other day, and I was able to open it up, put various bits back in place, and get it working again. It tripped not one but <em>three</em> circuit breakers in the house <em>and</em> blew the fuse in its plug, all while it was failing, but that&rsquo;s what safety devices are for, I guess.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;ve just fixed the switch on our hoover. Actually it&rsquo;s a Miele, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wDyUF8Y-As">this video</a> by an Australian repair person was really helpful. He&rsquo;s dealing with a different model, but it&rsquo;s the same problem &ndash; the switch wouldn&rsquo;t stay on &ndash; and the same construction and even part number.</p>
<p>I was able to get the footswitch off following what he did, and order a replacement part online. It arrived today, and all went back together really smoothly, and now our <del>hoover</del> Miele vacuum cleaner<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is working again.</p>
<p>Oddly the part number on the replacement is different from that on the broken one, which matched the number the video guy quotes.</p>
<p>Anyway, while I&rsquo;d have tried these repairs under normal circumstances, it&rsquo;s especially useful at the moment, when it&rsquo;s not like you can go shopping, or get someone to come in and fix things.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve never read Greene before, except for I think one short story, and a chapter or two of his autobiography. This is fascinating. It&rsquo;s the story of a Catholic priest in Mexico at a time when the church was banned. I had no idea that such a time existed: I think of Mexico as a very Catholic country, so such oppression is surprising.</p>
<p>The genius of it is that all the characters are so convincing. From the &ldquo;whisky priest&rdquo; himself &ndash; sinful, still believing, considering himself damned, yet trying to do what he can for people he feels are his parishioners; through to the hardline atheist lieutenant of police that is trying to find him. No-one is entirely good or bad, but there is sympathy for them all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s justly considered a classic.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Out to the supermarket today, because we were running low on a few things and our next delivery isn&rsquo;t arriving till Monday. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve been out &ndash; except to the back garden &ndash; since the <a href="/blog/2020/04/07/the-last-bike-ride/">bike incident</a>. Admittedly that was only four days ago, but like everything now, it feels a lot longer.</p>
<p>And I felt some trepidation about it. The world&rsquo;s a dangerous place: the very <em>air</em> is dangerous, depending on who you get close to. And some you can&rsquo;t avoid, because pavements have a finite width, and some people <em>still</em> walk blithely two-abreast, or on their own but down the middle&hellip; honestly, people, keep your distance.</p>
<p>In keeping with my <a href="/blog/2020/04/02/wear-a-mask-and-celebrate-your-immune-system/">recent exhortation</a>, I wore a mask. Just a bandana, but as I said there, anything is better than nothing. And hey, it reminded me of The Clash in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ttJBdr6eBuo">&ldquo;Bankrobber&rdquo; video</a>.</p>
<p>Sainsbury&rsquo;s was fine. A spaced-out queue of about ten people outside, one-in-one-out, and maybe only five people in the shop at once (it&rsquo;s one of the small Sainsbury branches, I should note). All very well handled</p>
<p>People with and without masks &ndash; some kind of face covering, at least &ndash; I&rsquo;d estimate at around 30/70. Some with were also wearing gloves and looking very overheated.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a feeling of society &ndash; there already, and that I think might grow &ndash; when you&rsquo;re masked: you see someone who isn&rsquo;t, you shy away; while when you see another mask wearer you make eye contact. A small nod passes between you: we&rsquo;re different. We&rsquo;re connected. We&rsquo;re doing something they&rsquo;re not. Or maybe just, we have the same fears.</p>
<p>On the way back I passed a bus stop, where the only person waiting was an NHS worker on her way to a shift at Homerton Hospital (I assume, because that&rsquo;s where the bus goes). A month ago I&rsquo;d have wondered why people wear their staff passes outside of their work. Today it&rsquo;s a badge of honour.</p>

			 <h2 id="abstracttldr">Abstract/TL;DR</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m changing my site. Everything should go on working, but comments will disappear for a while.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m changing both the server my site runs on, and the way it&rsquo;s built. I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> for the blog since I started it in 2006 (before that I used <a href="https://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a>, and at some point I imported those posts, so the earliest entries go back to 2002). Just recently, though, I started having a problem with it.</p>
<p>Everything was still running OK, but I couldn&rsquo;t post to it from external sources. So I couldn&rsquo;t use <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, which is my preferred way to post, or the <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> app for status updates, or even services like <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>, which has been adding notes and ratings for all the films I&rsquo;ve watched over the last few months, from <a href="https://letterboxd.com/devilgate/films/diary/">Letterboxd</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I could have tracked down the cause and fixed it. But then there&rsquo;s also the fact that I recently got round to upgrading to WordPress 5<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I had avoided that because I didn&rsquo;t like the new editor <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/09/02/4985/">when I tried it out before</a>. I don&rsquo;t know quite why, but eventually I bit the bullet and upgraded.</p>
<p>And I hate it. I never really cared for the online editing experience at the best of times, which is part of the reason I preferred using MarsEdit. But I just have a visceral bad reaction to the new editor.</p>
<p>Add to that that static sites are a) much faster to serve and b) what &ldquo;all the cool kids&rdquo; are using nowadays. I started to look into moving to a static site.</p>
<p>The two big players here are Jekyll and Hugo. I&rsquo;ve used Jekyll before, when I was at SAHSU. The <a href="https://smallareahealthstatisticsunit.github.io/rapidInquiryFacility/">documentation for the RIF</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> is hosted at GitHub Pages, and that uses Jekyll, so it&rsquo;s worth having a local implementation for testing, which I did.</p>
<p>But as a programmer, there can be times when you want to change the tools you use. Jekyll is written in Ruby; Hugo is in Go. I don&rsquo;t know either of those, and while I like learning new languages, that wasn&rsquo;t the purpose of this exercise.</p>
<p>In short, I wanted something that is written in Python, and I found it in <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> For reasons too boring to explain, I had trouble with it on my existing server, so I&rsquo;ve set up a new one at <a href="https://www.linode.com">Linode</a>. I&rsquo;ll be switching over to it later today. You shouldn&rsquo;t see any changes, except:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the comments on the blog will disappear. They&rsquo;re not lost, and I plan to get them back, but I need to find the best way to do that. For now, comment via Twitter or Micro.blog.</li>
<li>The Atom feed may be broken. I&rsquo;ll try to get that fixed. The RSS feed should still be fine, and at the same location as before. Anything that uses it should carry on working without any fuss.</li>
<li>If you follow me via WordPress.com (Hi Andrew), sorry. That&rsquo;s going away. Try my <a href="https://devilgate.org/blog/feed">RSS feed</a> instead. Or Twitter; all posts automatically get Tweeted to <a href="https://github.com/devilgate">my timeline</a>.</li>

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2020/04/07/the-last-bike-ride/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-04-07 11:04:09 &#43;0000">Apr 7, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I came off my bike today. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not hurt, beyond a couple of scrapes. But as I was going down &ndash; you know how people say things go into slow motion? It wasn&rsquo;t quite like that, but I did have time to think, &ldquo;Shit, I hope they don&rsquo;t have to call an ambulance.&rdquo; And once I was down and realised that nothing was broken, I thought, &ldquo;I hope no-one comes running to help, cos I&rsquo;ll have to wave them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No-one came to help, of course &ndash; mainly because there was no-one around. But all this is ironic, given that I read a piece a week or so back by a keen cyclist, saying he wanted to ride, but wasn&rsquo;t going to, because if he got hurt then he&rsquo;d be taking much-needed resources from the NHS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very noble,&rdquo; I thought, and then proceeded to completely ignore the implied advice.</p>
<p>No longer. From now until this is over, I&rsquo;ll be exercising indoors, or at most, in the garden. It&rsquo;s a shame, because I do love to get out on the bike, especially in the spring. But everyone has to put up with limitations during this, and this is a pretty minor one.</p>

<p>Also odd is that the Shortcut that I used to create this post pulled this text out as the title: “The Media &amp; the 2019 General Election: trusted, but little consumed.” Which would be better in terms of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> burying anything, but I can’t see where it came from. The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag, I’d have to guess, but you don’t really see those on a phone. And not that much on a computer, once you’ve got more than a couple of browser tabs open.</p>

			 <p>This is a sweet little story, exactly described by its title. The professor in question is an elderly mathematician who has had a brain injury that has left him with only 80 minutes of short-term memory. The housekeeper, therefore, has to introduce herself to him every morning when she arrives at his house.</p>
<p>She has a son who comes along sometimes, and there are maths puzzles and baseball.</p>
<p>It doesn’t sound like much from that description, and it’s very short. But it’s thoroughly compelling and enjoyable.</p>

<p>We went to WOMAD a couple of weekends ago, and in the literary tent we caught the end of a reading from, and an interview with, this young Hackney writer. It was an interesting talk and the book sounded compelling, so we bought a copy (and got it signed).</p>
<p>It’s set over 36 minutes on the inaugural journey of a new (nonexistent) London bus route, from Hoxton to Highbury. Told as the thoughts and conversations of various passengers (and the driver).</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with the area and the local slang (which may in fact be national or global slang in places), it’s particularly enjoyable. But the themes are universal, so don’t suppose it’s <em>only</em> for Hackney &amp; Islington folk.</p>
<p>I have my problems with the ending, but it’s well worth checking out (and it’s very short, and in bite-sized pieces, if you’re looking for something easy).</p>

<p>I’m pleased to have finished the first book of the year — and the first of my Christmas books — already. It’s a book about travel, and the human body, and some people and things that happen to them. Is it  a novel? It consists of a series of short sections, and a few longer ones. I can’t really call them chapters: some are no more than a paragraph, even a sentence. It does have characters, though: notably the narrator, who is the voice of most of the shorter sections. She appears to be someone who spends most of her life travelling around the world without necessarily any destination or purpose in mind.</p>
<p>That doesn’t make it sound as compelling as it is. There are connections between at least some of the stories, which make me think there must be more connections that I missed. A lot of it regards the preservation of dead bodies, from early embalming techniques to the “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Body Worlds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” plastination of Gunther von Hagens.</p>
<p>In the end it doesn’t quite form a unified whole, so in that sense I’m not sure we can really call it a novel. But it’s strangely compelling, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>

			 <p>As you’ll recall if you’ve been paying attention, <a href="href=/blog/2018/09/01/chile-trip-part-1-there-and-back/">I started what appeared to be a series of posts</a> on our trip to Chile. But then stopped. Well, not exactly, because here we are again. It just takes me a long time to sort out all the photographs.</p>
<p>We spent three days in Santiago (and another one at the end, just before we flew back).</p>
<p>You can click on any of the photos or galleries below for a bigger view.</p>
<h2 id="santiago-street-art">Santiago Street Art</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There’s a lot of street art, much of it <a href="/galleries/Santiago%20Street%20Art%20--%20Artists/">showing some of the artists, musicians, and writers who have come from Chile or had an impact on it</a>.</p>
<p>There are <a href="/galleries/Santiago%20Street%20Art%20--%20More/">plenty of other subjects</a>, though.</p>
<p>As well as oddities like this gym which is supporting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the most popular Linux distribution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And there is <a href="/galleries/Santiago%20Public%20Sculpture/">more formal public art</a>, too.</p>
<h2 id="up-hill-down-cable">Up Hill, Down Cable</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Santiago is in the foothills of the Andes, at 500m above sea level, so mountains are all around it:</p>
<p>[aesop_gallery id=&ldquo;5117&rdquo; revealfx=&ldquo;off&rdquo; overlay_revealfx=&ldquo;off&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Though it’s hard to tell the mountains from the clouds in that first one.</p>
<p>But there’s a hill in the city itself, big enough to have both a funicular and a cable car. We went up one and down the other.</p>
<p>[aesop_gallery id=&ldquo;5130&rdquo; revealfx=&ldquo;off&rdquo; overlay_revealfx=&ldquo;off&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Apart from the ride, you get great views, of course, but the main attraction is the giant statue at the top: Our Lady of the Radio Masts:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Also known as the Ladderback Virgin:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(OK, those are just my names for her.)</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing you really go up for, though:</p>

<p>And then there’s this lovely bridge:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is five volumes of graphic novel that I read over a period of about a month or so, and — OK, you know how we all thought that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Watchmen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is Moore’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->magnum opus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, at least in comic terms?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>We were wrong. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Promethea<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the best thing Moore has done, by some margin.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, of course.</p>
<p>The character Promethea is sort of a personification of the human imagination. She has manifested through various women in history, called from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->immateria<!-- raw HTML omitted --> into the “real” world by an artist — usually unknowingly, at least at first — when she is needed.</p>
<p>There are, of course, forces ranged against her, from demons to the FBI. The Earthbound part of the action takes place in a sort of alternative comic-book New York, where there are “science heroes” like the Five Swell Guys.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>University student Sophie Bangs is writing a term paper on the recurrence of the character of Promethea through myth and literature and comics, when she is attacked by a mysterious shadowy entity. A version of Promethea turns up to help her, and… well, read it and see.</p>
<p>And as well as the storytelling, the art is incredible, with some wildly challenging layouts; but it never gets in the way of the story. It is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->magnificent<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, spanning all of fiction and myth and religion and magic, and reminding us that those are all the same thing. Looked at one way, anyhow.</p>

			 <p>Also known as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dark Gifts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> trilogy. I bought the first while at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent BSFA meeting<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where Vic James and  Lucy Hounsom, another fantasy author, interviewed each other. I enjoyed their conversation so much that I bought the first book in each of their trilogies.</p>
<p>I don’t read fantasy much, and I don’t really care for dystopias in SF, as I’ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mentioned before<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So this being a fantasy dystopia, it shouldn’t really appeal to me.</p>
<p>But it turns out it’s great.</p>
<p>Apparently it was pitched in jest as ‘<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Downton Abbey<!-- raw HTML omitted --> meets <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Game of Thrones<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a world where Voldemort won.’  And… yeah, I guess. I haven’t read or seen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Game of Thrones<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the time period is more-or-less present day. And none of the magical people (or Skilled ‘Equals’) is as out-and-out evil as Voldemort. But it’s not a bad description of the setup.</p>
<p>The idea is that there are people with magical abilities — referred to as ‘Skill’ — and they are the aristocracy and rule the country. Or at least they have been since Charles the First and Last was killed by one of the Skilled, and they — also known as ‘Equals,’ ironically — took over running the country. Britain is an ‘Equal Republic.’ One thing that annoyed me at first is that there is no mention of what happened to Scotland. It appears to be part of Britain in the present day, but Charles the First (in our reality) was before the Acts of Union. Although not before the Union of the Crowns, so I suppose the Equals just took over Scotland too, by getting rid of the monarchy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Anyway, the worst part about the rule of these magical Equals is ‘Slavedays,’ wherein everyone is required to spend ten years of their lives as slaves. They get some choice in when they do it, but while you’re doing it you’re a slave, with everything that implies.</p>
<p>I found it hard to cope with the idea that people would just quietly accept this state of affairs. But I suppose if it’s been that way all your life, and it’s the law of the land… But I couldn’t help but think, wouldn’t people revolt against it?</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, of course, a trilogy like this is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the maintenance of the status quo.</p>
<p>It’s really good. Well worth a read.</p>

			 <p>Closer to the Cultural action again, though a lot of this happens on a shellworld, one of thousands of weird, ancient, constructed worlds scattered through the galaxy. They are an incredible image, but in a sense they don’t matter.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Most of the events that happen on the shellworld don’t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to be on it. Except maybe in this way: it allows Banks to tell a story that includes civilisations both at the musket stage, and at the godlike AI stage.</p>
<p>Civilisations on the various levels of shellworld are allowed to develop at their own pace, unhindered and unhelped by the more advanced “involved” groupings in the teeming galaxy (at least in theory). And yet they know of the existence of the advanced, spacefaring races. I can’t help but think that that very knowledge would have a profoundly debilitating effect on any society. Imagine knowing the Culture existed, but that you were excluded from it.</p>
<p>This is exactly why the Culture generally doesn’t make less advanced societies aware of its existence. It’s the reason for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Trek<!-- raw HTML omitted -->’s Prime Directive. Yet somehow this story works even with some of its protagonists having that knowledge.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wrote about it a decade ago<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, when I first read it. I seem to have enjoyed it more this time. I didn’t notice the linguistic foibles, and while I was aware of the weird shadow-wrongness of the cover, I’m used to it, so it didn’t trouble me.</p>

			 <p>Gaiman takes on Thor, Loki, Odin, and the rest. Most of my knowledge of the Norse gods comes from Marvel Comics, with a bit of general cultural osmosis (for example, everyone has heard of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yggdrasil the World Tree<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, right?)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I enjoyed it, but it feels like a slight work. That’s a shame, because these are mighty tales, or should be. I guess it’s a book meant at least partly for children, but it’s not marketed that way. And even if It’s meant for kids, the telling should be strong.</p>
<p>I suspect that if you already know the tales, this won’t offer much new to you. And that’s where the problem lies, I think. Instead of turning them into real narratives with proper characters, each story is not much more than a summary of the events. So he’s telling us the story of the story, rather than really telling (showing) the story. It’s a shame, because I know Gaiman could have done something much more interesting with these.</p>
<p>I’m probably being too harsh, though. It’s not like it’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I enjoyed reading it.</p>

			 <p>I read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this reviewed in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and immediately bought the Kindle book. Sometimes a review is like that.</p>
<p>And it lived up to the praise. But here’s the thing: the horror, the weirdness in it: they’re not really what we’d think of as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lovecraftian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with that, and part of the reason for the title is that a couple of the main characters are fans of Lovecraft’s work, and they refer to parts of New England as “Lovecraft country.” But as the review makes clear, the real horror here is much more down to Earth: the racism of 50s America.</p>
<p>My Kindle edition was slightly oddly titled: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lovecraft Country: TV Tie-In<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You expect that on a physical book to some degree. But putting it right in the title is new to me. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A page on the author’s site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> confirms that it is going to be made as a series by HBO (which is annoying, because that means it’ll be on Sky Atlantic over here). JJ Abrams<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and Jordan Peele are both involved.</p>
<p>I’m slightly surprised to see that Ruff is not black. I wonder how long before he’ll be accused of “cultural appropriation” for writing from the viewpoint of African-Americans.</p>

			 <p>I went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a thing at the British Library<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It was an author event with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Audrey Niffenegger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eddie Campbell.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> They’ve made a book together. And, it turns out, they’re married. To each other, that is.</p>
<p>I had no idea that this was the case. Who’s in charge of telling me about things? Cos they’re falling down on the job.</p>
<p>Not that there’s any reason why I should know, of course. They’re both creators whose work I’ve enjoyed in the past, but that’s all.</p>
<p>Anyway, this was the standard sort of author talk/interview thing, led by a guy who didn’t introduce himself, but according to the event page was “international comics expert, and man at the crossroads, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul Gravett<!-- raw HTML omitted -->“.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It was all very good. I bought the book, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bizarre Romance<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Looks like it’ll be fun. I didn’t stay for the signing, because I’m not that bothered about autographs. And I couldn’t think of any questions at the Q&amp;A, which is also normal.</p>
<p>Interestingly (and maybe this is already common knowledge too) Niffenegger is writing a sequel to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Time Traveller’s Wife<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> to be called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Other Husband<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I watched the new series of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twin Peaks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in January, but haven’t got round to writing about it yet. In part, maybe, because I knew I wanted to read this. In part, because I want to watch it all again.</p>
<p>The series was amazing: an incredible, beautiful, challenging piece of art. But, as always with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twin Peaks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> there was the question at the back of my mind: is he using surrealism to raise real questions, to investigate mysteries, to raise our consciousness? Or is it just weirdness for weirdness’s sake?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In the end I lean towards the former. Maybe the whole thing is like a zen koan: if a portal opens in Ghostwood Forest and no-one is there to see it, what will come through?</p>
<p>Anyway, addressing the book at hand, what we have is quite a short volume which is presented as being a report from FBI Special Agent Tamara Preston to Deputy Director Gordon Cole (played by Lynch himself in the show, of course). Its ostensible purpose is for her to summarise what she and the Bureau have learned from the events that the recent series covered, and some other offscreen investigations. It follows on from, and comments on, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last year’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Secret History of Twin Peaks<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Much of it repeats what was in the series, but it does add detail and help to clarify some things. For example it’s probably not a spoiler to confirm that the girl in the 1950s in the glorious nightmare of episode 8 was, indeed, Sarah Palmer, as Warren Ellis has speculated. (It was in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his newsletter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which doesn’t seem to have a public archive.)</p>
<p>But it also follows up on what happened to most of the characters from the the original series that we didn’t hear about in the new one, giving us much-needed closure. Or at least convincing us that the creators didn’t totally forget about Donna, for example. Along the way it does what the new series failed to do, in that it answers the question raised at the end of the original series: “How’s Annie?”</p>
<p>It’s worth reading, but it doesn’t remove the need for me to watch the whole new series again.</p>

			 <p>Well hello. It&rsquo;s been a while. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That daily posting thing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> didn&rsquo;t work too well in the latter part of the year, and was particularly weak in the last couple of weeks. Weak weeks.</p>
<p>In fact I posted 261 times in 2017. It&rsquo;s surprisingly hard to find that kind of thing out from Wordpress itself. I had to dig into the database and run some simple SQL:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>261 is 72% of the days of the year, which is not too bad. Certainly the most posts in any year out of the past  fifteen(!)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the monthly breakdown:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A strong start, tapering off in the middle, with a rally in November and then a complete collapse in December. I suspect the last is from a combination of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post-nano slump<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the festive season.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested, here&rsquo;s the SQL that got me that table:</p>

			 <p>The news that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Murdoch plans to sell 21st Century Fox and Sky TV to Disney<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is interesting for how it will reshape the media landscape. But it’s good from my point of view for a number of reasons, some relatively trivial and to do with content consumption; and one big.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Above all: better Disney than Murdoch.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Will Disney own too much? Hell yes. But see above.</p>
<p>On the ethics of watching — and paying for — Sky TV: see this blog <!-- raw HTML omitted -->passim<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for my thoughts on that. Like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If Sky had not been owned by Murdoch we might conceivably have got it in the past. But I feel we’re highly unlikely to get it now. Buying a dish in 2017 would just be weird, and our side of the road is not cabled, by some odd historical aberration. But there’s the online version,  which I think is called Direct TV. If we had had that I would have been able to watch the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twin Peaks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when it was actually broadcast, instead of now, on DVD, as is actually happening.</p>
<p>Loving it, by the way. And managed to hear no spoilers whatsoever, surprisingly.</p>

			 <p>Yes, it’s halfway through the second-last month of the year and I’ve just finished my fifth book. Five in a year. That’s very poor. But this book was a large part of the reason for that.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>At over 1000 pages of very small text — close to a million words, I’ve heard — this is a  mammoth work. It’s also really, really good.</p>
<p>As befits such a large work, it is a whole made of many parts. It’s split into three main sections, with each of those having eleven chapters; along with a “Prelude” and an “Afterlude.” The first is a series of short stories or vignettes, most of which are not obviously connected. They are all set in and around an area of Northampton called the Boroughs, at various times in the past and present.</p>
<p>In the second we find out what happened to Mick Warren, the closest thing we have to a protagonist, after he died aged three, before he came back to life again. The third brings it all together, after a fashion. Moore has always had trouble with endings — just consider the mighty <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Watchmen<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, whose ending was actually improved by the movie.</p>
<p>Did Alma Warren’s pictures save everything, and stop the destructor? Of course not: it always happened that way and always will. That’s the central thesis of the novel, the idea of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eternalism<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that time is static, and we only experience change because we happen to be moving along that axis at one second per second. This is of course similar to the viewpoint of Dr Manhattan in the aforementioned <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Watchmen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so we could suppose it’s a worldview that Moore has had for some time, though in his acknowledgements he suggests that he came to believe it during the years he was writing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jerusalem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>There is a chapter in book three that is written in the style of Joyce in his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finnegan’s wake<!-- raw HTML omitted --> days. It’s hard work to get through, but well worth it (though with hindsight if you were to skip that chapter I don’t think you’d miss much of the plot). Anyway, it’s a monster work, and well worth the time it takes to read.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NaNoWriMo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is just around the corner, and I still haven’t quite decided whether to throw myself into it this year or not. I’ve taken part several times in previous years, but never completed the 50,000 words. And this year I still have the novel that I’ve been working on intermittently for about four years, that I’d like to finish off.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be better, and more in the Nano spirit, to start something new. But I think if I were to do that, I’d never finish this one, and it would sit there forever, haunting me. Maybe taunting me too, who knows.</p>
<p>I should have a better chance of getting the word count up this year, as I have a longer commute, and I usually get a seat at or near the start of the longest part (Dalston Junction to West Croydon, if you’re interested). So it should be entirely possible to get two free blocks of writing time each weekday. But I have found it to be strangely offputting to write in that environment, when there’s a person sitting on either side of me.</p>
<p>Sure, they’re probably not in the least interested in what I’ve got going on, but as Stephen King says in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On Writing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you’ve got to write the first draft with the door closed.</p>
<p>Still, I have recently been looking at the novel again, and I think I’ve worked out how to end it. That has always been the problem for me: I don’t do a detailed plot, but I need to know how a story’s going to end if I’m going to have any chance of finishing it. If I just start writing with only an idea, maybe a setting and some characters, I tend to meander around all over the place and never get anywhere. Or at least, not to a sensible end.</p>
<p>I don’t have to know much about the route, but I need to know the destination, in other words. So as I now know the destination — or at least have a much clearer idea of it — I think it’s time to take one last run at this thing.</p>
<p>But this is me declaring that I’m throwing my hat in the Wrimo ring. I’ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->signed up<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and even given it a working title<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> — by raiding that fount of quotes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Tempest<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>My iPhone 6 was getting slow, and its battery was poor. I have been thinking of replacing it. But September is approaching, and Apple will announcing new iPhones (three new ones, according to rumours). So I had more or less set my mind on waiting till then.</p>
<p>That would also be consistent with my iPhone buying history: 3G, 4S, 6… the next in the sequence is 7S.</p>
<p>Friday changed my plans. I was standing at a bus stop on Old Street, just replying to a WhatsApp message. Something touched my hand, and for half a second I thought someone was bumping into me. Then there was a firm grip on my phone and it was gone. Pulled right out of my hand and off down the road on a moped — which must have come across the pavement from behind me.</p>
<p>I should have been more aware. I knew this kind of theft was a thing. We’ve been hearing about them for a few months. But you don’t always think about it, and you never think it’s going to happen to you. And, yes, OK, drink had been taken. But not that much.</p>
<p>The bus arrived a few seconds later, so there was nothing I could do but get on and head home. There was another guy at the stop who witnessed it, and he very kindly set up a hotspot on his phone and let me use it from my iPad. The Find My iPhone app didn’t find it, so the thief had probably turned it off right away. But I was able to request a remote wipe in case it’s ever turned back on, and I got an email from Apple saying all the card details had been removed from Apple Pay.</p>
<p>All of which meant I had to make a trip to the Apple Store on Saturday. And to the Three store, where it was alarmingly easy to get a replacement SIM. I just had to tell them my phone number and give them a payment card. No questions asked. Not even my name and address.</p>
<p>So I now have  jet black 256 GB iPhone 7. Which is lovely. I’m late to all the new features, obviously, but here’s a quick rundown:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Plus, it’s black. Really, really black.</p>
<p>Even the box was black.</p>
<p>The cables are still white, of course. Which reminds me, I’ve always disliked Apple’s ear buds, and passed all my past ones on to my kids. But I thought I’d give these a try, not least because I wouldn’t mind trying the AirPods if they’re ever in stock anywhere,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and they have the same form factor.</p>
<p>And I don’t hate them. I thought I always had trouble getting them to stay in, but that doesn’t seem to be the case now. The main problem is they don’t give enough sound isolation, so you can hear the traffic and people talking even with music or a podcast playing. I’ve always preferred the kind with rubbery tips, which form a seal. But aside from that, these are better than I expected. Which bodes well for AirPods.</p>
<p>Downside: the battery life doesn’t seem dramatically better than my old one, weirdly. For the first couple of days it was busy downloading updates and restoring things (and getting hot), but that should be over now. I’m assuming that I just have to give it a few full cycles till it beds in and the measurement gets more accurate.</p>
<p>And all the things you have to set up again. That’s not the fault of the phone, though, so much as the way it came to me. If had planned this I would have done an encrypted iTunes backup, which would have meant more things were restored to the new phone.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was a lot of words and no links about not very much.</p>

			 <p>Back to form, then, with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> season 10 episode 4, “Oxygen.” Jamie Mathieson has written some good episodes before, and he keeps up the standard here. A tale of capitalism red in tooth and claw, it reminds us at times of “Silence in the Library,” and also of Duncan Jones’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It’s a “monster of the week” episode, but the monster is capitalism. This season so far has been surprisingly political. Well, maybe not surprisingly. These are politically-charged times, and science fiction is nothing if not of its time.</p>
<p>There are no particularly egregious pieces of nonsense here, either. Why the suit’s force-field helmets are OK inside the station but not enough outside isn’t really explained, but the real reason is so the actors don’t have to wear helmets for the whole episode, so that’s all right.</p>
<p>Oh, one thing: they’re on a space station: what are they mining? I mean, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for<!-- raw HTML omitted --> copper, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> what? We have to assume it’s asteroids, but they could just have said.</p>
<p>The really interesting stuff is what we might call the “arc” material (if we are harking back to our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Babylon 5<!-- raw HTML omitted --> days). The shades are back, but only because The Doctor is blind now. Can he fix it by regenerating, maybe? Or by doing a partial regeneration, like Ten? And more about the vault and The Doctor’s oath. Nardole fears what would happen “if that door opens.” But we saw it open last week, so things are not quite as Nardole thinks, at least.</p>
<p>And the very last scene in the “Next Time…” Yes!</p>

			 <p>Earlier today I added a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->short microblog post in which I called Nigel Farage a traitor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Its a strong word, and maybe one that I shouldn’t throw around so casually.</p>
<p>I don’t really go in for patriotism, nationalism, and all that kind of thing. But I do want Britain — the country I live in, was born in, and am a citizen of — to be the best country it can be. On the assumption that most citizens would have a similar desire, it seems reasonable to me to think that a citizen who acts against that desire — against the country’s best interests — is betraying the country.</p>
<p>Nigel Farage has made it his life’s work to get Britain to leave the European Union, and has been successful in making (or at least starting)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that happen.</p>
<p>Leaving the EU is not in the best interests of the country.</p>
<p>Therefore Nigel Farage has been working against the best interests of the country. Therefore he is a traitor.</p>
<p>It’s a simple syllogism.</p>
<p>Of course, he’s far from alone in this. I count Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and, of course, Theresa May in the same group. And many more.</p>
<p>Indeed, you could argue that anyone who voted to leave the EU is similarly guilty, but that seems unfair. Many knew exactly what they were doing, of course. But many also (possibly many more) were duped.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean much if I name these people as traitors, but it’s worth recording what my thinking was behind using that term</p>

			 <p>The Doctor is a burning sun of outrage, but claims never to have had time for it. Season 10, episode 3, “Thin Ice,” sends him and Bill into London’s past, to 1814, and the last great frost fair on the frozen Thames.</p>
<p>There is a beast below the ice<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> There is a racist lord. There are cute dirty-faced urchins, and acrobats, and a fleeting glimpse of an elephant.</p>
<p>I loved almost everything about this episode. In fact the only negative point to me was the use of the old diving suits. You need someone onshore, operating an air pump, to use those, and there was no evidence of such a thing. It’s one of those things that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is prone to. Not a big deal in this case, but it wouldn’t have hard to have included a few words about The Doctor modifying them with a compact air supply, or something.</p>
<p>No matter, as I say, it was an almost perfect episode. And we got back to The Doctor’s office at the end, where Nardole was making the tea (with added coffee for flavour).</p>
<p>And who or what is in the mysterious vault? The knocking of course echo’s “He will knock four times,” at the end of Tennant’s run, and that was The Master. And we know that The Master — or at least John Simm — as well as Missy, is gong to be in this season.</p>
<p>But it would be very strange if it were him in the vault.</p>

			 <h2 id="an-election-unlike-any-other">An Election Unlike Any Other</h2>
<p>This election is going to be completely unique in our lifetime, probably ever. Because people will be torn between voting on the normal things they care about: health, security, homes, welfare, the economy… — and the big thing of our time: Brexit.</p>
<p>There were close to half the electorate who voted to stay in the EU (close to half the turnout, anyway). There’s no reason to suppose that any of those have changed their minds, even if many now talk in terms of acceptance. There are plenty who voted the other way who wish things had gone differently. And the non-voters are an unknown.</p>
<p>If a party — or a coalition — were to clearly stand on a platform of stopping Brexit, or even of promising a second referendum, they would be in a position unlike any party ever. Or so it seems to me.</p>
<p>Unfortunately only the Liberal Democrats seem to be even close to that position.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="i-cant-vote-labour">I Can’t Vote Labour</h2>
<p>I can’t in conscience vote for a Labour party that won’t clearly place itself against Brexit. I just can’t. This means I have to leave the party, I guess. Corbyn called today for “A Brexit that works for all.” No, no, no.</p>
<p>I imagine this means I’ll be voting Lib Dem. Possibly Green. I’m not sure where they stand yet. In one sense, of course, it doesn’t matter, as I live in one of the safest Labour seats, but that’s not really the point. I’ll be writing to Diane Abbot to explain my position, but I don’t imagine it will change hers, which is to support Corbyn, even though her constituency is one of the most pro-remain in the country.</p>
<p>I voted for Corbyn as leader twice, but he’s very disappointing now. Though I have to say that his policies on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->literally everything else<!-- raw HTML omitted --> would be dramatically better than the Tories.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="why-and-why-now">Why, and Why Now?</h2>
<p>Why has Mayhem changed her mind on a snap election, and why now? The obvious thing is the Tory lead in the polls, and to take advantage of Labour chaos. Nothing to with Brexit at all, not directly.</p>
<p>But something I was seeing on Facebook tonight was the idea that they were about to lose their majority, when the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) brings charges for electoral fraud against up to 30 Tory MPs. The prosecutions will still happen, but they won’t affect the position of MPs who get elected this time round (well, unless they get convicted, of course, but I’m guessing the Tories will quietly deselect the ones who are likely to go down).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="effect-of-fixed-term-parliaments-act">Effect of Fixed-Term Parliaments Act</h2>
<p>My first reaction was, “They can’t: what about the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act?” Turns out that contains a clause that lets the sitting parliament ignore it, as long as they get a two-thirds majority. The irony of that figure was not lost on me, as possibly my most-retweeted tweet shows:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>— Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->April 18, 2017<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Without Labour voting with the government they wouldn’t get that two-thirds. Corbyn has cheerfully agreed to go along, missing an open goal. First, the opposition should oppose the government, as a general principle. Unless the government is doing the right thing, which is not the case here. More amusingly, if they didn’t get the two-thirds, they would have to go for a vote of no confidence. That is, a Tory MP would have to stand up in the House of Commons and move that “This house has no confidence in Her Majesty’s Government.” Even if they could come back from that, Corbyn should have forced it just for the lulz.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="polls-cant-be-trusted">Polls Can’t Be Trusted</h2>
<p>All is doom and gloom, because the polls look so bleak. Except… if there’s one thing the last few years have taught us, it’s that we can no longer rely on polls.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

			 <p>Funny where thoughts of current affairs take you.</p>
<p>All the fawning (and, to be fair, condemnatory and neutral) coverage of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trump’s bombardment of a Syrian air base<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in response to Assad’s gas attack have stated the quantity and type of munition that was used: “59 Tomahawk Cruise missiles.”</p>
<p>Those of us who lived under the shadow of the mushroom cloud in the 80s will remember that missile. It was the one stationed at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Greenham Common<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which of course was the subject of much protest, mainly from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Women’s Peace Camp<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The Greenham camp was primarily part of the anti-nuclear movement, as the missiles stationed there carried nuclear warheads. Obviously the ones the US launched a couple of nights ago didn’t, but what the whole thing did was remind me of a song from that time: “Tomahawk Cruise,” by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TV Smith<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‘s Explorers.</p>
<p>I recall hearing that song in my Dad’s car<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> back when it came out. It’s possible that I only heard it that one time, but it has stuck in my mind all these years, just waiting to be shaken loose.</p>
<p>On listening to it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on Apple Music<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I’m pleased to find the chorus is almost exactly as I remembered. The rest of the lyrics are more oblique than I’d have expected. It was an anti-nuclear song, but less obviously than I’d have thought.</p>
<p>It’s very 80s, as you might expect (it was released in 1980), but there is, of course, nothing wrong with that. Inevitably it’s to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->found on YouTube<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spotify<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Not sure whether this counts as nostalgia, in terms of my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post the other day<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I don’t really care. What definitely isn’t, though, is the album I’m listening to as I type: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Chiswick Story<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Various Artists<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (most of whom I haven’t heard) is a potted history of the label.

			 <p>My recent and forthcoming live music experiences all involve bands of my youth that have reformed and are touring their old material.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Wallowing in nostalgia, some might call it.</p>
<p>But there’s nothing inherently wrong with bands getting back together. It can be problematic if you are the band that tours as the Dead Kennedys, of course. There’s a whole saga there that I won’t go into, but if Jello Biafra’s not involved, and in fact is actively against it, then it’s not the Dead Kennedys.</p>
<p>Indeed, in his song “Buy My Snake Oil” Jello suggested that a way for old punks to make money off their history would be to</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Which is a fair criticism of old bands doing their thing in modern days, I guess. But I see two arguments to counter it, from a gig-goer’s point of view.</p>
<h2 id="unfinished">Unfinished</h2>
<p>The first was made by my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Andrew<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, around the time that the Sex Pistols reformed and toured. This would have been in 1996.</p>
<p>“I missed them first time round,” he said when I challenged him about it. “This is unfinished business for me.”</p>
<p>Which was a good point, and kind of made me regret playing the purist and not going.</p>
<p>In 1993 I had investigated going to see the reunited Velvet Underground. But I really didn’t want to see them at an all-seated venue.  Partly because I’d had a bad experience seeing Lou Reed a year or so before (despite having had a very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good<!-- raw HTML omitted --> experience with him a year or two before that).</p>
<p>I recall that I phoned the venue — Earl’s Court, I think — and found that it did have some standing room. But those tickets were sold out. So I didn’t go. Regretted that, too. So I’m taking the chance to see bands like the Rezillos, or The Beat and The Selecter, that I missed first time around.</p>
<h2 id="ok-but-what-is-it-really">OK, But What is it Really?</h2>
<p>The second point about the “punk nostalgia wave” (or any similar accusation of nostalgia) is: that is not what it is.</p>
<p>Because here’s the thing: it isn’t nostalgia if you’re carrying on with something that was always there.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But this isn’t that. Because while those bands’ heydays might have been in the past, their music has remained available and frequently-played. You can’t be nostalgic for an album you listened to last week, or last night.</p>
<p>And a live performance always happens in the present.</p>
<p>This train of thought was kicked off for me a couple of years back when there was an article in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, prior to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Force Awakens<!-- raw HTML omitted --> coming out. I can’t find it now,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> but it claimed that “nostalgia” was part of the cause of the excitement for the new film.</p>
<p>And I thought, no. Well, maybe for some people. But for many of us, if not most of us, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> never went away. We’ve watched it,  talked about it, read theories about it, and so on. It has been part of our lives.</p>
<p>Or take <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Sure, there were the wilderness years before 2005, but The Doctor never really went away. The Tardis and Daleks are burned into Britain’s cultural memory, and I think they always will be.</p>
<p>Now if I were to see an episode of, say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marine Boy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> would be nostalgic. I remember it fondly from my childhood, and have never seen it since. I’ve never even seen it in colour, because those were the days of black &amp; white televisions.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>But I can’t be nostalgic for punk bands or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, because they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->never went away<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The sense of warmth and shared experience they bring: that’s not nostalgia, it’s something else. Familiarity, at worst. Or better: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->community<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has recently been brought to our attention that you are claiming legal ownership of the word ‘punk’ and are sending threatening legal notices to those you feel are infringing on that ownership by using that word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hadn’t heard this about Brewdog. If it’s true, they’re being beyond ridiculous (or possibly winding people up). I’ve got a lot of time for a Scottish company making craft beer, even if it’s only OK (and too damn strong most of the time: I like a beer you can drink a few of without falling over). But like the Garageland people, I thought their “Equity for Punks investment portfolio did raise some eyebrows.”</p>
<p>The open letter ends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definitions of punk are varied and debates over those definitions have been going on since before you were born. However, one thing punk is not is a bully! That goes against everything punk stands for. If you continue in this vein your punk credentials will be revoked and you will be called upon to cease and desist.</p>
<p>Kind regards and a middle finger salute</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and is then signed by hundreds of bands. So many that I can’t really believe the website got agreement from all of them. But I heartily endorse the message.</p>
<p>In other good news, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hugo Awards nominations were announced<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it looks like a great list, and also like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Puppies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have been almost totally wiped out this year. Yay fandom!</p>

			 <p>No, that’s nothing to do with hamburgers. Apple today <!-- raw HTML omitted -->announced<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that they’re working on a redesign of the Mac Pro. This is huge news.

			 <p>Spent most of today in the garden, making a start on clearing it up for the summer. Not exactly gardening, as such. More gathering sticks and leaves, and putting them into brown bins for collection. Nice day for it, though.</p>
<p>Then this evening to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Barbican<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for the New York Philharmonic doing a couple of pieces by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Adams<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as part of the “John Adams at 70″ series. Oh, and in the middle they had a cello concerto by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Esa-Pekka Salonen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Who was the cellist? Nobody special. Just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yo-Yo Ma<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>It was clearly a virtuoso performance, but I didn’t enjoy the Salonen nearly as much as I did the two Adams pieces. Especially the second, “Harmonielehre.” Among other things, it’s good to see something orchestral where the percussionists have some serious work to do.</p>
<p>Not that we could see the percussionists, mostly. We were effectively in the front row. Which is to say, it was row D, but row C was right up against the front of the stage, and not being used because the stage had been extended into rows A and B. That orchestra is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->big<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The downside of having such close seats is that you can only see the first few rows of the orchestra: the string sections, basically.</p>
<p>The big upside of the position, of course, is that you get such a close view and intimate sense of the performance. It’s almost like you’re inside the music at times.</p>
<p>Meanwhile British politics has gone even crazier, with Michael Howard crawling out of the woodwork to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->threaten war with Spain<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But that’s a discussion for another time.</p>

<p>To be fair to Howard, that’s not at all what he said. Just that May should be as steadfast with Spain as Thatcher was with Argentina. But “war” is of course how the papers are hyping it.

			 <p>I was thinking about the loss of singles. Not individual tracks released individually: that still happens, of course; perhaps more than ever. But back in the days of actual, physical singles — 45 rpm records, or even CD singles later — you didn’t just get an individual track.</p>
<p>I’m here to celebrate — and maybe mourn the loss of — the B-side.</p>
<p>When you bought a single you usually knew what the main song was going to be, because you had heard it on the radio, or at least read a review. Or you might just know and trust the artist’s work, and believe that the chosen track would be worth your 75p.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But there was always the promise that there would be something good on the other side, too.</p>
<p>Often, of course, the B-side track was really “B” quality, or lower. It was genuinely just filler. Which was always a shame. I remember flipping Elvis Costello’s “Oliver’s Army,” to find out what “My Funny Valentine” was like. I hated it, and never listened to it again. Though as (in other versions) it’s something of a jazz classic, it’s possible that I’d like it more now.</p>
<p>The Members’ classic “The Sound of the Suburbs” was backed by something called “Handling the Big Jets,” which always sounded slightly rude to us<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and I think was an instrumental.</p>
<p>But for every one of those you could get a “Jail Guitar Doors,”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> or a “The Prisoner.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Or almost any Beatles single.</p>
<p>Then there were double A-sides, wherein both sides were supposed to be worthy of being playlisted. They always felt like slightly better value for your hard-earned pocket money.</p>
<p>And when CD singles came along they usually had three tracks, raising them arguably into the EP category.</p>
<p>But now, tracks are realised for streaming or download, completely on their own. It’s very sad, and I’m sure they must feel lonely. Plus if you’re buying the download and you want what would have been the B-side, you have to pay for each individual track.</p>
<p>I was going to say, as well, that if you search for single on your streaming service of choice, you only get one track. But I found out the other day that’s not quite true. I wanted to listen to “Elephant Stone,” by the Stone Roses; and in fact the B-side, “The Hardest Thing In the World” <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was<!-- raw HTML omitted --> listed too. Its “Album” tag was given as “Elephant Stone — Single (2009)”.</p>
<p>Which apart from the wrong date (and ok, it could’ve been a reissue <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>) is not a bad example of misused metadata. Or maybe just misnamed: not every gathering or carrier of a group of songs or musical pieces is an “album”.</p>
<p>Or maybe that’s just a change of meaning: what we used to call a single or an EP is now just a very short album.</p>

			 <p>Podcast adverts are the least offensive of all types of advertising. Because even though they’re in your ears, they’re not in your face.</p>
<p>I’m talking, here, about the sponsorship kind, wherein the podcast host reads some ad copy in their own voice. Sometimes copy supplied by the company, sometimes their own words. Sometimes they just read plainly, sometimes it’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more entertaining<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But it’s always relevant and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->vetted<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I’m more likely to look at the product or service mentioned in a podcast that I listen to regularly than any that’s advertised on a website. Especially if the website uses a popup.</p>
<p>And if you don’t want to listen to the sponsor’s message, podcast players make it very easy to skip forward.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>One organisation that has been sponsoring a lot lately is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Away Travel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They make a range of modern, four-wheel, hardshell suitcases. Their carry-on versions have the innovation of including a battery and a couple of USB ports, so you can charge your phone, iPad, etc, while you’re at the airport.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>They seem like they make a pretty good product. But the strange thing is that the podcast hosts all stress how inexpensive the cases are. But they’re not. The biggest one is nearly £300. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Lewis sells a similar Samsonite model<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for £179, for example.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the Away one is tougher, of course. Impossible to tell without seeing them side by side. But I don’t think Away should be trying to sell themselves on cheapness when they’re significantly more expensive than a high-end brand. Embrace the expense; go for the luxury market. Or something.</p>
<p>It works for Apple.</p>

			 <p>Back in January I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote about trying to play podcasts through the Sonos<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As you’ll recall<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I had tried and failed to install AirSonos on my NAS, and was considering trying <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SonoAir<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my Mac.</p>
<p>I did try it, but it never quite worked. The app launched, and found the Sonos network and the speaker. But it didn’t appear as an AirPlay device to my phone. I could make it work in one context: iTunes (on the same Mac) could see it and use it as a functional output device.But that wasn’t much use, as the Sonos already has access to my iTunes library from where it’s backed up on the NAS — and also to Apple Music. So being able to play from iTunes to the Sonos brought nothing new.</p>
<p>The added functionality I was looking for was to be able to play podcasts from Overcast, and switch to the speaker when I’m listening in the kitchen. For that my iPhone or iPad needs to be able to see the speaker.</p>
<p>So it all didn’t look too promising. But I was just having another go, and I noticed that the version on the website is 1.0 (BETA 6.1), while I had BETA 4. A quick download and we’re up and running: it works!</p>
<p>Now I just have to keep my MacBook running at all times. Oh well.</p>

			 <p>Well, yesterday genuinely feels like the first day I’ve missed posting this year. A few post-midnight posts have counted towards the previous day, but although I’m writing this early in the morning, it’s definitely the 16th.</p>
<p>It’s for a good reason, though: I went to the pub after work.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The occasion was the monthly drinks for ex- and still-current-Misys people. Always good to see folk I haven’t seen for a while. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Misys are in the news at the moment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It looks like my old section, Payments &amp; Messaging, won’t be long for this world (even what little is left of it). This <!-- raw HTML omitted -->D+H<!-- raw HTML omitted --> outfit — Vista, the owners of Misys, have bought them and are planning to smoosh them together with Misys — is big in payments. I’d expect that their products will be seen as superior, and our Payment Manager will start to be sunsetted.</p>
<p>That’s certainly the likely trajectory if Misys management end up running the combined organisation. They have a permanent, severe case of inverse not-invented-here syndrome. Any product that the company has been making and selling successfully for years (decades, in the case of Midas and Equation) is automatically suspect and needs to be edged out in favour of something that came from another company, and/or is newer and less capable.</p>
<p>Mind you, those old products have a habit of keeping on keeping on (and making the company money). Because, of course, they meet the needs of customers.</p>
<p>Not that anyone was talking about that at the pub.</p>

			 <p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->International Clash Day<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I mentioned a life-changing song: “Wasted Life,” by Stiff Little Fingers. SLF’s anti-military song literally changed my life; or its potential direction, at least. I was probably moving in an anti-war kind of direction anyway, to be fair, but it was definitely a trigger point.</p>
<p>People say — or used they to, at least — that a song couldn’t change your life. By comparison, I don’t think there was ever a similar tendency to say that a book couldn’t change a person’s life. I suspect that is down to their comparative sizes: it seems respectable for something the size of a novel to have a major impact on a human’s psyche, while a three-minute song? Not so much.</p>
<p>Although if it were merely length, then people wouldn’t have complained if you said an album changed your life. I’m not sure that anyone ever said that,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but I suspect that if they had, their statement would have been pooh-poohed just as much as the same claim for a song.</p>
<p>At this point I feel I ought to quote Springsteen, giving the opposite view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We learned more from a three-minute record, baby,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Than we ever learned in school</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he sings in “No Surrender.” Hyperbole, certainly, but there is a core of truth to it: the truth of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feeling<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you can get from listening to a great song.</p>
<p>With “Wasted Life” the feeling for me was of sudden crystallisation, or realisation.  I had, for some years, been saying that I wanted to be  pilot, join the RAF. This was before the horrors of the Gulf War, or for that matter the Balkans. Though it was in the heart of the Cold War, and British soldiers were stationed in Northern Ireland during the troubles — though not so much RAF staff, I would think.</p>
<p>But I was blind to all that, brought up as I was on a diet of Second World War films, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Commando<!-- raw HTML omitted --> comics, and Airfix models of warplanes. I had, in short, a thoroughly romanticised view of war. And I just wanted to fly.</p>
<p>But I didn’t want to kill. I  had always known that, I’m sure. But <!-- raw HTML omitted -->two lines<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of that one song made it real for me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stuff their fucking armies<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Killing isn’t  my idea of fun<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that was all it took. I remember that it was a while before I could tell my parents that I had changed my plans. Perhaps because they would have asked why, and I didn’t want to have to explain it. Maybe because I thought they’d be disappointed. I’m sure my Mum wasn’t. My Dad kind of was: “But you were going to be a Spanish-speaking pilot,” he said. He had always been slightly amused that my school taught half of us Spanish, instead of the then-much-more-conventional French.</p>
<p>A life can hinge on such a small moment.</p>

			 <p>Many songs these days involve one or more other artists guesting with the main one. Rappers adding a part to a singer’s track, for example. Nowadays such guests are always credited. Quite rightly: we’ve come a long way from the days when Billy Preston played keyboards on some Beatles songs uncredited (though visible in the famous Apple Records rooftop performance).</p>
<p>As featured artists, such guests are nearly always credited using the abbreviation “feat.” “The Beatles feat Billy Preston,” to give an example that was never used.</p>
<p>But “feat” is a word on it’s own, of course, as well as an abbreviation. Which I think may be why I always find the formation slightly amusing. And there used to be a band called Little Feat, if I’m not very much mistaken (I’ve never knowingly heard them).</p>
<p>So I’ve been wondering how the modern crediting style would have worked if they had ever been guests, or had featured guests, on any of their songs. “Little Feat feat Joe Feet.” “Legs &amp; Co feat Little Feat.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Alas, it was not the way back then. Though <!-- raw HTML omitted -->their Wikipedia article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> suggests they’re still around, so it could happen.</p>
<p>More surprisingly it tells us that they changed “Feet” to “Feat” as a “homage to the Beatles.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I had no inkling of that connection when I mentioned the Beatles above.</p>

			 <p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Colour of Television<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Jack Deighton questions the worth of the famous opening line of William Gibson’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neuromancer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sky above the port was the colour of television, tuned to a dead channel.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jack questions its meaning, and describes it as “an author, straining, unsuccessfully, for effect.” I commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[D]on’t take it so literally. It was obviously meant to mean “the screen of a television set,” but writing’s all about deleting unnecessary words, as Orwell told us.</p>
<p>I always took it to mean a stormy grey sky. Not literally speckled like an old telly on a channel where there was only static, but that was certainly what he was going for. Imagine that roiling, churning, grey-black-white melange, converted into a sky of a similar colour palette.</p>
<p>It’s so evocative, so memorable, it’s almost poetry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus there’s The Doors connection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also always took it as reference to the Doors’ song “My Eyes Have Seen You,” that goes, “… under the television sky! Television sky!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lyrics sites — and my ears, this evening — say it’s actually plural: “television skies!” But that doesn’t make any difference.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve always loved it — that opening, in particular. I mean, I’m fond of the book, but don’t go back to it that often; but the opening is unforgettable.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In having a look around before writing this, I discovered that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->there’s an extract on Gibson’s site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which reminds me that it&rsquo;s all that good. Reading that extract, what think of most is the beats, or Hunter S Thompson.</p>
<p>And interestingly it isn’t done with the sky after the first line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you couldn’t see the lights of Tokyo for the glare of the television sky</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By day, the bars down Ninsei were shuttered and featureless, the neon dead, the holograms inert, waiting, under the poisoned silver sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which last point suggests that Jack’s over-literal concern about the meaning of the opening might have an answer: maybe the sky was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->literally<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that staticy colour of an old TV between channels. If so, I don’t think we ever got a reason for it. But it’s implied there has been at least one war in the not-too-distant past of the novel.</p>
<p>Opening lines are so important. To my mind Gibson’s is up there on that bright, cold day in April, just around Barstow on the edge of the desert, with an exploding grandmother.</p>
<p>But to each their own, of course.</p>

But I spent a couple of hours this morning reading reviews of it, whch I don’t do with every film, so there’s that.</p>
<p>And a couple of weeks ago we saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->La La Land<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Which is a bit of pointless froth, but is fun enough.</p>
<p>Anyway, that means that on the day before the Oscars I’ve seen three of the nominated films. I don’t think this has ever happened before.</p>
<p>In fact I might never have seen that many Oscar-nominated films in any year at all.</p>

			 <p>Do you ever look around and think how amazing everything is? How it all got there? And I’m not talking about the grandeur of nature, the glory of the universe, and all that. I’m talking about all the human-made stuff.</p>
<p>I have often found myself in the middle of a city, or looking out of a train window at a bridge or power station, and thought, “Wow: people built this. Just ordinary people, like me, actually made all this.”</p>
<p>Look at ancient buildings and you realise that they used to do it without the help of modern machinery, too.</p>
<p>And then think about the infrastructure that’s carrying these words from where I’m typing them to where you’re reading them. Hundreds of miles of fibre and copper cables across the country. Thousands of miles of undersea cables. Satellites, and the rockets to launch them.</p>
<p>We’re pretty amazing sometimes, us humans.</p>
<p>Like I say, I’ve often thought about this kind of thing. But today, while not at work because I’m a bit under the weather <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I had a slightly different version of it.</p>
<p>I had a sudden, overwhelming sense of how much <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cultural<!-- raw HTML omitted --> work we have created.  Specifically stories and TV and films. Though in fact it was comics that really triggered it.</p>
<p>As I say, I’m not at my best, so I wanted something simple. I ended up reading a bunch of comics on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marvel Unlimited<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And no matter how many I could read in a day, I could only make the tiniest of scratches in the surface.</p>
<p>And in TV, Netflix seem to have a new original series or two coming out every week.</p>
<p>It’s not all great, of course. But just think of all those people, writing away, acting, filming. Making things.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I saw a hashtag on Twitter this evening: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#InternationalClashDay<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Well, it doesn’t take a lot, and now my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actual<!-- raw HTML omitted --> favourite Clash song is blasting out of the Sonos: “Death or Glory,” from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->London Calling<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I say “actual” because if asked I would usually say that “(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais” is my favourite Clash song (if not overall favourite song, and very probably that too). And then I listen to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->London Calling<!-- raw HTML omitted --> again, and am reminded of the glory of “Death or Glory.”</p>
<p>If anyone ever asks who my favourite band is I’ll unhesitatingly say, “The Clash.” Almost unthinkingly, which may not be good; but some things become part of us.</p>
<p>I can almost remember when I first heard them properly. It was at Bob McGarry’s house. He played a single and then tried to impersonate John Peel, saying, “Those were The Clash,” which is how Peelie often used to back-announce things in those days. I don’t recall what track it was: “White Riot,” probably. I wasn’t overwhelmed, to be honest. It certainly didn’t have a life-changing feeling; not like when I heard Stiff little Fingers’s “Wasted Life,” possibly in the same house, or maybe it was in Brendan Conroy’s. I must write about that one someday.</p>
<p>But other songs and albums were waiting. I can’t honestly say what it was that finally did it for me. Maybe “Tommy Gun” or “English Civil War.” Maybe “White Man” itself. I do know that shortly after <!-- raw HTML omitted -->London Calling<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was released, my friend Steven Watt said to me, “I envy you: you haven’t heard <!-- raw HTML omitted -->London Calling<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yet.”</p>
<p>Somewhere in there, though — after I bought my first copy of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->London Calling<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for £3.99<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and before I bought <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Sandinista<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the same price — I was fully onboard, and searching for all the old singles in Glasgow record shops.</p>
<p>Writing that makes me think that the point of transition might actually have been when I saw my friends’ band The Varicose Veins<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> doing “Clash City Rockers.” In which case a cover version was key. Which is fine. One of The Clash’s most famous songs, “I Fought the Law,” was a cover, after all.</p>
<p>I should probably be able to explain <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they mean so much to me, but I’m not sure I can. It’s probably a combination of affinity for their viewpoint, the sheer raw energy of their early songs, and their lyrics.</p>
<p>But maybe not. Maybe it’s just that the golden age of music is around 14-15, and lessons learned then — lessons burned on the soul — stay with us.</p>
<p>“The only band that matters.” It’s been quoted so often it’s become a cliché. But that doesn’t mean it’s not true.</p>

			 <p>Yes, yes, it’s all very meta: all I ever write about is blogging.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But that is exactly what I want to talk about today: is a blog better if it is only on one subject?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I suspect that the most successful blogs in terms of size of readership are fairly closely focused on a single subject. I read several technology blogs, such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daring Fireball<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six Colours<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MacStories<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which all write mainly about technology with an Apple slant. They have all achieved success by keeping that focus.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, there are some highly enjoyable ones that take a broader scope: Tim Bray’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ongoing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, John Scalzi’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Whatever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wil Wheaton<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‘s blog; those authors write about whatever<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> takes their fancy.</p>
<p>I, as you’ll have noticed, take the latter tack. But the question is, should I be more focused? Should I concentrate on writing about politics, say?<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>It’s worth considering, certainly, but here’s the thing: I’m not actually sure what I would focus on. I don’t think I have the single-mindedness to keep to the same subject. I value the flexibility of the old-school, personal blog.</p>
<p>Which is just as well, since that’s what I seem to be writing. So there you go.</p>

			 <p>Things go quicker than you think. This <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tweet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> post<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was inspired by a tweet, and I thought it wasn’t too long ago. But in fact it was April last year.</p>
<p>My friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yusuf’s tweet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> inspired me to finally write about the term “biftace” and why I chose it and what it means. Actually I thought I had written this before, but it seems not.</p>
<p>So a long time ago, when I was first thinking of a name for my blog — before it even existed, indeed — I thought about the way the press used to refer to teachers working “at the chalkface.” The analogy with miners at the coalface was probably originally meant to disparage the labour of teachers as being less than that of miners. I’m guessing here, but considering the term seems to have originated in tabloid journalism, and tabloids tend to be disparaging of anything intellectual — though to be fair, they haven’t exactly been friends to miners either, over the years.</p>
<p>Anyway, I quite liked the term, and wanted to come up with something similar to refer to my own industry, that of programming. I tried out one or two for size, at least in my head. “Byteface” felt more accurate (it’s rare for an application programmer to care to much about bit-level things, and I mainly write Java, which compiles to bytecode); but it didn’t feel right.”Codeface” would have been another, but again, didn’t feel right.</p>
<p>“Bitface” did feel right, and so an early version became “The Bitface Diaries.” I don’t think I ever made that live.</p>
<p>When I started <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Livejournal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which nowadays is just one of my syndication targets) I went with “Tales from the Bitface,” which I still like. And then when I decided to set up my own site I went with “A Labourer at the Bitface,” which harked back to the original impetus for inventing the word, and also alluded to my support for the Labour Party.</p>
<p>Which means I’m considering a rename now, as I consider my future in said party. But that’s another blog entry.</p>
<p>The conversation with with Yusuf was about hardware, which is not what the term was about. But I never worked out what we should call working with hardware in similar terminology.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been saying for a while now that Brexit is worse than Trump, because Trump is only for four years<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> — less if he gets impeached or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->twenty-fived<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is almost certain; but Brexit is forever.</p>
<p>But Trump is moving so fast, following through so fiercely on his campaign promises, that even if he doesn’t last, he’s going to do incredible damage to the USA, and to the world.</p>
<p>And then there’s pieces like “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trial Balloon for a Coup?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,” which, along with the stories it links to, is terrifying. If the things suggested there were to come true, Trump and his successors could be forever, too.</p>
<p>And even if they manage to get rid of him, that means Pence takes over, which would be its own class of awful. He at least knows something about government and the Constitution, though. I guess?</p>
<p>So I don’t know. Brexit, if we can’t stop it, is going to be bad for the economy, jobs, and society; but despite the hard-right support for it, I don’t think it means the country is being turned into a fascist state. On the other hand, after a Tory-led hard Brexit they could make the UK into what they’ve always wanted: a tax-haven for the rich and sweatshop for the poor, with permanent austerity policies.</p>
<p>And there’s no opposition to speak of.</p>

			 <p>Further to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->letter to Diane Abbot<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I saw her last night on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Question Time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Disappointingly she was trotting out the line that, irrespective of what they believe, MPs are now tied down by the “democratic will of the people.”</p>
<p>That is utter nonsense.</p>
<h2 id="did-the-referendum-give-a-democratic-mandate">Did the Referendum Give a Democratic Mandate?</h2>
<p>The referendum, as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have said before<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, did not provide a sufficient majority to change the country’s constitution. In fact, it did not provide a majority at all: thirty-seven percent of the electorate voted to leave. That is under <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no<!-- raw HTML omitted --> circumstances a democratic mandate.</p>
<h2 id="do-mps-have-to-abide-by-the-referendums-result">Do MPs Have to Abide by the Referendum’s Result?</h2>
<p>The referendum was advisory, not binding. That was very clear in the act of parliament that enabled it, though it wasn’t mentioned at all in the discussions running up to the event itself. The MPs were asleep at the wheel when the bill went through parliament: if they had given it the thought it deserved, they would have made its advisory nature explicit in the wording of the question; and more importantly, they would have set a proper threshold for it to take effect. A two-thirds majority is common in cases like this.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>MPs make up the house of commons, half of parliament, the sovereign body in the UK. Their role is to scrutinise legislation and to vote on it in accordance with what they understand to be the best interests of the country.</p>
<p>No-one can say that Brexit would be in the best interests of the country. (Well, OK, they can say it; but they are demonstrably wrong.) MPs not only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> vote against the triggering of Article 50: doing so is their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->duty<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-most-mps-switched-to-being-in-favour-of-brexit">Why Have Most MPs Switched to Being in Favour of Brexit?</h2>
<p>Or at least that’s the way it seems.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know. I  have my theory, though. They are running scared of the tabloid newspapers. And maybe, as one of my friends suggested on Facebook the other day, literally scared for their lives if they were to resist the Brexit onslaught. Remembering the tragedy of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jo Cox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, of course.</p>
<p>If the latter is really why they are doing it, then the terrorists have won. And even if it’s only fear of the tabloids, then the tabloid terrorists have won. If I were inclined that way I would call the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daily Mail<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sun<!-- raw HTML omitted --> traitors to their country for trying to ruin the British economy and damage British society, by forcing us out of the EU and assaulting the European Convention on Human Rights (which, if it needs to be said again and again, was written by Britons and is nothing to do with the EU).</p>
<h2 id="whats-to-be-done">What’s to be done?</h2>
<p>Buggered if I know. If our democratically elected representatives won’t do what they’re elected for and act in the best interests of the country, then I can only conclude that we’re fucked.</p>

			 <p>John Gruber <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reminds us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of Hunter S Thompson’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->obituary of Richard Nixon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, saying it “[f]eels appropriate today” (this was yesterday, of course).</p>
<p>I hadn’t read it in a while, but there are some glorious lines in it:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Which is not exactly accurate according to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it’s not too far off.</p>
<p>The quote Gruber draws our attention to is this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Which reminds me of something I’ve been thinking about for a long time. Which is that I don’t think I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->want<!-- raw HTML omitted --> journalism to be objective. At least not in the area of political commentary. News is different, of course. But to me the best journalistic writing comes about when the writer’s personality comes through. When their unique voice can be heard in every paragraph. HST was of course the exemplar of that, but you don’t have to be as extreme as him to write things that have some heart and soul about them, that do more than just recite the facts.</p>
<p>Indeed, that journalistic objectivity is part of the problem. The whole he said/she said reporting of science in particular — just think of the way climate change is discussed <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>; or the MMR fake controversy of a few years back. Journalists need to be able say, “This person says x but they’re wrong because of y and z.”</p>
<p>And that isn’t necessarily even being subjective. It’s just being willing to not treat both sides of a debate as equal when they’re not.</p>
<p>Back to HST on Nixon, and the crookedness of the Republicans:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

			 <p>Not a lot to say about today. Trump is president. World War III hasn’t started yet, but presumably he’s got the nuclear codes now.</p>
<p>Actually it’s entirely possible that whoever is responsible for briefing the new president on such matters (and come to think of it, who is it who has that responsibility?) didn’t actually give him the real codes, or the real nuclear football. After all, they’ve probably taken an oath to defend the republic (I’m now assuming it’s somebody military) against enemies domestic and foreign, and one could safely argue that Trump is an enemy of the republic.</p>

			 <p>38 Degrees is consulting the public on a “DIY Brexit,” wherein the public can give their opinions on what Brexit should look like, and supposedly the results will be looked at by a group of think-tanks who are being consulted on the matter.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->things people have come up with<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so far all seem pretty good and sound, at a first glance (kind of hard to read, the way it’s presented with big fixed header and footer).</p>
<p>But. But what we want is not the best Brexit we can get. What we want is no Brexit at all.</p>
<p>And I think I can safely say I speak for the majority when I say that. But Theresa May and her crazy government don’t look like they’re willing to listen to anyone about it.</p>
<p>You know how all recent prime ministers get “isms” named after them? Ever since Thatcherism, at least?

			 <p>For one reason or another we wanted to remind ourselves<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of the Spanish word for “south.” I like to ask Siri for that kind of thing, because speaking to your phone is just easier than unlocking and typing sometimes. And Siri is not bad. It quite often gets the right answer for this kind of thing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not so much there, though.</p>
<p>So it correctly understood my question; but instead of feeding it to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Translate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or another translation service, it sent it to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wolfram Alpha<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, seemingly. And that came back with intriguing answer that the Spanish for “south” is “about 99027 people.”</p>
<p>Seems like an unwieldy way to specify a compass direction.</p>

			 <p>I just watched the last episode of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Class<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, BBC 3′s web-only<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> spinoff.</p>
<p>It is really, really good. If you haven’t seen it you should stop reading this now and go and watch. Really. I’ll still be here when you get back.</p>
<p>Eight episodes with special guest appearances at the start and (spoilers) the end, about five young people in the famous Coal Hill School. Famous from the very first episode of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, of course, right up to the 50th and beyond. It’s now an academy, not surprisingly. And it seems that it is — or always has been — something of a nexus in space and time.</p>
<p>I’ll not say much more, as it would be hard not to get spoilery. But I will tell a little anecdote of how I watched it.</p>
<p>I saw episode 6 first. Why? Because I was careless, and iPlayer has stupid defaults. I went to the site and searched and found the programme, and started watching the first episode it presented me with. Because that would be the first episode, obviously, right?</p>
<p>Wrong. The rationale is sound: iPlayer is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->catch-up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service; and the episode you’re most likely to want to catch up on is the current one. So the episode I saw first was 6, “Detained”, which must have been current at the time.</p>
<p>Thing is, I don’t think there can have been a “Previously…” at the start — though there was later — or I think I’d have noticed. I was just impressed with how it started straight in, giving touches of backstory in moments of dialogue, so that by the time the five teenagers were locked in the detention classroom and the plot began to unfold, I was really impressed with this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in medias res<!-- raw HTML omitted --> beginning and compact storytelling.</p>
<p>Well, of course, after that I realised my mistake and went back to the beginning. And when I got to 6 again it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->did<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have a “Previously…” But if you didn’t start at the beginning, it was probably the best one to start at.</p>
<p>Is it great? Maybe. It’s certainly got the potential to be so. It’s better than early <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Torchwood<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, maybe not quite as good as the best of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sarah Jane Adventures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Well worth watching, and I hope there will be more serieseseseses.</p>

			 <p>Now that the new version of Apple’s PC operating system has launched, some thoughts on something that’s been bugging me for a while.</p>
<p>Apple’s OS was called “OS X” from about 2000 or so. At one time it was “Mac OS X,” then at some point they dropped the “Mac” part. Now, of course, they’re dropping the “X,” (and the capital “M”) and going over to calling it “macOS.”</p>
<p>In the old version, I knew that the “X” was the Roman numeral for 10. It was release 10 of their operating system, so that was fine. But I always pronounced it as the letter “X” in my mind. Not least because, as the version numbers incremented, they were presented like this: 10.2, 10.3, and so on. Or more fully, “Mac OS X 10.2.”</p>
<p>So how were we meant to say that? “Mac Oh Ess ten ten point two”? Surely not. You can see why my internal monologue pronounced it “Oh Ess Ex ten point two”.</p>
<p>And so it was and so I left it. I knew the “X” had originally meant “ten,” but I couldn’t imagine that anyone would still pronounce it that way. Until I started listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>Wherein erudite, knowledgable Apple users such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Gruber<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or the hosts of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Accidental Tech Podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were clearly heard to talk about “Oh Ess ten.” Though they mostly avoided saying the full, convoluted, Roman and Arabic mix of numbers. I think I did once hear <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Sparks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac Power Users<!-- raw HTML omitted --> saying “Oh Ess ten ten point eight” (or whatever minor release number it might have been).</p>
<p>Still, I didn’t let it bother me. It wasn’t doing any harm, after all.</p>
<p>But then people started talking about relative sizes. I think I first noticed it when retina screens were being discussed. If you’re going to provide graphical resources to support both retina and non-retina screens, you have to provide versions of the image files at different resolutions. These are referred to in writing as “1x” and “2x” versions.</p>
<p>Now, it is obvious to me that that isn’t a letter “x” there (even thought that’s what I typed), but a multiplication symbol. More properly rendered as “×”.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The idea being that you have the original file, and one at twice the resolution. The multiplication symbol is said as “times.” So we have “one times” and “two times.” Right?</p>
<p>But those pesky podcasts.</p>
<p>Soon they were filled with “one ex” and “two ex.” It was the OS X problem all over again — but this time in reverse!</p>
<p>But I gradually realised I might be wrong in my assessment. Graphics files are complicated beasts, after all. A file suitable for a retina screen doesn’t have twice the pixels needed for an older screen, for example: it has four times as many. There are twice as many on the x-axis and twice as many on the y-axis.</p>
<p>And that’s when I realised that the “x” might refer to the x-axis. Saying a file was “2x” could be shorthand for saying that it had twice as many pixels on both its x- and y-axes.</p>
<p>In which case pronouncing it “two ex” would be right after all. Perhaps the terminology came from developers and designers referring to size of the files.</p>
<p>Except… I have subsequently heard people say other numbers followed by “ex,” when what they clearly meant was a multiplier. Specifically, I heard <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CGP Grey<!-- raw HTML omitted --> saying “ten ex” when talking about a tenfold increase in something like YouTube subscribers. And he used to be a maths teacher, so he should really know better.</p>
<p>Can we ever escape from this insidious invasion of “ex” into spaces where “times” belongs? Probably not. But it’s disturbing when otherwise-smart people make themselves sound so ignorant.</p>
<p>(And don’t get me started on the full-stop or period character that splits up those version numbers. Hint: it’s “point”, not “dot.”)</p>

			 <p>The other night we watched <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lincoln<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Steven Spielberg’s 2012 film about the US president. It covers just a few months towards the end of the civil war and his life, during the time when he was trying to get the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution<!-- raw HTML omitted --> through the House of Representatives (the Senate having already passed it). That’s the amendment that outlaws slavery.</p>
<p>It was dramatised, of course.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>But what struck me, and what held resonances with our current situation, was the sheer amount of compromising he had to do.</p>
<p>Then I read an article on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about Hillary Clinton, which included this:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, I’m far from being convinced that Owen Smith, even if he were to be elected as leader, would put us in any better a position. As well as being largely unknown in the country, he has what looks a slightly shady past, with his lobbying for Pfizer and speaking against the NHS. Though to be fair he rejects any talk of privatisation now.</p>
<p>Corbyn is constantly criticised for not building bridges, not reaching out to people within the party – even within his cabinet, as I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->linked to the other day<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think it’s fair at this point to say that he is at fault to some degree on the Remain campaign. And I’m certainly unhappy with his call, early on the day after the referendum, for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Article 50 to be invoked immediately<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That does strongly suggest that his support of the Remain campaign was only ever half-hearted at best.</p>
<p>But even if that’s all true, it doesn’t mean he is solely or even mainly to blame for the disastrous result of the referendum.</p>
<p>And the ongoing, slow-motion disaster that is besetting the Labour Party is at least as much the fault of the plotters. In particular, their behaviour at Prime Minister’s Questions the other day was disgraceful. Their point – renewing Trident was party policy, so the leader should not be speaking against it – was a valid one, but the floor of the House of Commons during the most important event of the parliamentary week, is not the place to argue about it.</p>
<p>The idea of Britain still being a nuclear power, and the doctrine of deterrence, are even more ludicrous now than they were during the 80s when I was a member of CND. But like I say, there’s a time and a place to have that argument, and it’s the party conference.</p>
<p>Maya Goodfellow has a great piece about it all in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>“Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist),” it says. You can just feel the layers of splits down the years that have led it to such an unwieldy name. Splits on the left are far from new. It’s an old criticism that we spend more time fighting among ourselves than fighting the real enemies.</p>
<p>Or in this case, than working out how to get back into power. Because going back to Lincoln<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and his compromises, to Hillary and her desire to get things done: it’s all for nothing if we don’t get a Labour government into power.</p>
<p>The problem is that Corbyn is “unelectable.” Is he? I’m not sure we know that. He’s sometimes compared to Michael Foot, who famously failed to win an election. But things are very different today from how they were in the eighties. It won’t be easy, but a Labour Party that got fully behind a left-wing leader might well be in a position to win power in 2020, when the next election is due. Or sooner, if May goes to the country over Brexit or otherwise.</p>
<p>In the end I wonder if Corbyn’s biggest problem isn’t just handling the Media. Maybe he needs an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alistair Campbell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> figure (or hell, why not: a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Malcolm Tucker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> one). Does he even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a press secretary or Director of Communications?</p>
<p>All of this leaves me not knowing how to vote in the new leadership election. My heart is with Corbyn, as most of his policies <!-- raw HTML omitted -->match my own principles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But if the MPs won’t get behind him again, then we’ll be right back where we are now, with the party not providing a useful opposition, and with no likelihood of electoral success.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Owen Smith, on the other hand, seems more likely to fight for us to remain in the EU. But can we trust him?</p>
<p>And either way, what will it do to the party as a whole? A party divided against itself, or worse, a party split in two, has no chance of forming a government.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>There was the referendum, and its <!-- raw HTML omitted -->immediate aftermath<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That’s still ongoing, of course, and won’t be over any time soon.</p>
<p>Then there was my leaving do from work, as I’d reached the end of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at-risk period<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and am now redundant, obsolete, out of work, etc. The do was good. We had a decent turnout of current and former colleagues. My boss’s boss’s boss, the one who told us the news that we were being made redundant, turned up (he is the only one of the hierarchy who is based in Britain, the intervening layers being in Manila) and paid off the tab at the time he left, which must have been about 7pm. We still managed to spend just over £250 after that, which was optimal, as there were five of us.</p>
<p>I got an Uber home, and accidentally discovered what the difference between “Pool” and “UberX” is. I found myself in a car with four strangers (including the driver). To be honest I don’t think “Pool” was an option when I last used an Uber. I assume the “X” means “Exclusive.”</p>
<p>Anyway, they were all going to Islington, which left me to snooze on to Hackney, so it worked out fine.</p>
<p>And then I was unemployed. It didn’t quite hit me at first, because my beloved and I had a weekend trip to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Avebury<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which was fascinating. Here’s a picture of some stones. And a sheep.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But Monday dawned, and I set to with my new daily plan:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As you might imagine, I haven’t exactly been sticking to that 100%. But the idea is that it’s going to be important to have some structure to my day now that I don’t have one imposed by full-time employment. And job-hunting can be very time-consuming, so treating that as my job for at least part of each day seems like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The first day was strange, because I kept having this sense at the back of my mind, “I’m working from home today, so I’ll be in the office tomorrow,” which would have been true on Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons for the last few years. But then of course it would hit me: no office; no job.</p>
<p>I’m enjoying the experience, though, so far at least. I’ve managed to do pretty well with the schedule, and even extended the swimming to using the gym at the local leisure centre. This is the first time I’ve ever used a gym, except for a few years ago when I had physio after <!-- raw HTML omitted -->injuring my leg<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The guy who did my induction managed to hide his disbelief of this fact quite well. And now that I’ve done a few sessions I’m thinking, “Why didn’t I do this years ago?” Oh well.</p>
<p>So all in all, a time of change and newness &ndash; which would generally be good, and some of it is. But see the first point, above, and the debris from that. An unknown new Tory government who don’t seem to be quite willing to accept that parliament is sovereign, and so <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it<!-- raw HTML omitted --> needs to decide whether or not to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. And Labour too busy tearing itself apart to hold the government to account.</p>
<p>As to the Labour leadership business, I’ll have more to say about that when I’ve worked out what I think.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Oh, I loved <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Asteroids<!-- raw HTML omitted --> back in the day. I solved <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Monument Valley<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I got on fine with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alto&rsquo;s Adventure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But I&rsquo;ve never got more sophisticated modern games. There&rsquo;s a whole big post about that that I&rsquo;ll maybe write one day.</p>
<p>But Pokémon Go has lit up the internet for the last week or so, and it sounded kind of fun. So I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try. Probably more healthy than arguing about the Labour leadership crisis on Facebook, anyway.</p>
<p>I was just out at the shops, and I remembered I had it, and sure enough, there was a wild Golbat outside the local supermarket. You&rsquo;ve got to throw the pokéball to catch them, right? I&rsquo;ve seen enough of the TV series with my kids to get that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But could I catch it? Could I buggery. No matter how many times I flicked up on the screen to send the ball towards it, it just would not connect. I must have tried like fifty times, standing outside the shop like an idiot.</p>
<p>This is why I never get into games. I soon hit upon something frustrating and get bored with them. No doubt I was doing something wrong. I&rsquo;ll try again, I suppose, but it&rsquo;s very discouraging.</p>
<p>Oh, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I couldn&rsquo;t get the name I wanted. &ldquo;Devilgate&rdquo; was taken, but so was it along with just about every suffix I could think of, including just random strings of numbers.</p>
<p>Kind of cool to see the pokéball rolling off under the vegetable racks, though.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>OK, so though Jonathan wrote the mighty “Roadrunner” (and apparently was called by some, “The Godfather of Punk”, though I thought that was Iggy), he later moved to a much more mellow, quieter sound. And that’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with that. We don’t always want to to be listening to the loudest stuff.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But anyway, it turns out that there’s this song about the Velvet Underground, which is cool as fuck, as you might expect. Jonathan, of course, has been associated with the Velvets since the early days, roadieing for them and whatnot. So who better to write a song that tries to evoke the startling, shocking effect they had on people, on the music scene, back in 1966 or so?</p>
<p>Here’s his description of John Cale in action:</p>

If you haven’t heard it, it’s on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Music<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spotify<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->YouTube<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where I understand the younglings like to go.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After one of the choruses where he sings, “How in the world were they making that sound?/Velvet Underground,” he says, “Like this,” and launches into a verse of “Sister Ray.” It’s all very, very cool.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Yesterday was the strangest day.</p>
<p>Anger, of course. Sadness. And confusion: how could this happen? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why<!-- raw HTML omitted --> did it happen?</p>
<p>What the hell is wrong with people?</p>
<p>But above all an overwhelming sense of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->change<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everything<!-- raw HTML omitted --> having changed, and not in a good way.</p>
<p>I went out for a walk at lunchtime, and it all felt so strange. What it felt like was that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->future<!-- raw HTML omitted --> had changed.</p>
<p>I know that sounds odd: how can the future change when it hasn’t happened yet? But that&rsquo;s exactly how it felt. Like some time-meddler had taken the future and given it a twist, so that it was off by forty-five degrees or so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m constantly thinking about the future normally, but I guess we just have a kind of background-hum sense of where things are going, and that hum stopped in the early hours of Friday, or changed frequency.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Enough of the metaphors and similes. I did some basic arithmetic. On a turnout of 72%, 52% voted to have the UK leave the EU.  That means 37% of the electorate voted to leave the EU.</p>
<p>Which means 63% of the electorate did not choose to leave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that you can&rsquo;t really assume the desires of the non-voters. But my thinking is  that the decision to leave the EU is tantamount to a constitutional change. I don&rsquo;t know what rules countries with written constitutions have regarding amendments, but my guess is that they will have a higher bar than a simple majority of the turnout. A two-thirds majority, or a majority of the electorate at least, I would expect and hope.</p>
<p>I had this conversation on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> site yesterday, wherein the people I was discussing with were saying in effect, &ldquo;You knew the rules when you went in.&rdquo; Which is true enough, but unhelpful. My real point is that the rules should have been different. Now we, the voting public, obviously were not paying close enough attention back in 2015 when the legislation for the referendum was passed. But we have representative democracy, and our representatives &ndash; our MPs &ndash; should have been on top of this. The referendum should never have been brought with such a low threshold allowed for leave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that Cameron  himself didn&rsquo;t ensure that it was hard to leave. Maybe he was a secret Brexiteer.</p>
<p>Or maybe he just didn&rsquo;t believe that the public would ever actually vote to leave. I think with hindsight that that&rsquo;s where I was: in my heart of hearts I couldn&rsquo;t believe that this would happen. And that is probably the root of the cognitive dissonance I felt yesterday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late now, of course. There&rsquo;s not much we can do (though there is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this petition<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which has enough signatures already for parliament to consider it). I wonder if someone could mount some sort of legal challenge, maybe get a judicial review.</p>
<p>Because from where I&rsquo;m sitting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->63% of the UK electorate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are about to be dragged out of the European Union without asking for it (or having actively stated their opposition). And that&rsquo;s not even to mention the people who aren&rsquo;t in the electorate, who will be most affected of all. My fifteen-year old daughter came home fuming yesterday; her whole school was in turmoil over this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re failing a whole generation if they see possibilities being closed off before they&rsquo;re even old enough to to vote.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Turnout is crucial. If the majority is narrow, and especially if the turnout is low, the losing side will have a very hard time accepting the result.</p>
<p>For example, imagine if the vote goes 55% for Leave, and the turnout is only 60%. That means that only 33% of the electorate has said they want to leave. 27% would have expressly said they don&rsquo;t want to leave, and 40% abstained.</p>
<p>But abstention can &ndash; and in my view should &ndash; be considered as being happy with the status quo. Yes, you can argue that it means that the abstainers are happy to go with the will of the majority of voters, but for such  a major change &ndash; effectively a constitutional change &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a safe assumption</p>
<p>So there ought to have been a requirement for a minimum turnout, and/or a majority of the electorate. In fact, for something this major, I&rsquo;m inclined to think that a mandate to leave should require something like a two-thirds majority &ndash; of the electorate, not just of the turnout.</p>
<p>Something like that was the case in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->original Scottish independence referendum<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; approval had to be by 40% of the electorate, not just a simple majority &ndash; though not in he 2014 one. I have criticised that fact in the past, but thinking about it now it seems right.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of course, this referendum will not be binding on parliament. If it goes to Leave, it&rsquo;s possible that a majority of MPs could vote against the legislation that would have to be enacted to start the actual departure. That would have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting<!-- raw HTML omitted --> results.</p>
<p>And if the majority is very slim in either direction, there will be calls for another referendum. Whatever happens on Thursday, we won&rsquo;t have heard the last of this for a long, long time.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>It was called, as anyone can tell, because David Cameron wanted to finally end the feuding in his party over Europe. The Tory party has been at loggerheads about it for decades. I have never known a time when they weren’t fighting about it.</p>
<p>So Cameron promised a referendum, thinking that if they were elected he could lance the boil, as they say. In fact what has happened in the end is that the boil has grown alarmingly, become infected, and is poisoning  its host.</p>
<p>But we shouldn’t gloat. The Tory party in its death throes could take a lot of good things down with it.</p>
<p>I read one piece recently that suggested that he didn’t actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->want<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do this. That he made the promise fully expecting a hung parliament in 2015, and then he’d be able to say that coalition partners had insisted on no referendum.</p>
<p>Which may well be true, but it doesn’t help us where we are now.</p>
<p>The poison has spread into the body politic of the whole nation, and we are all in danger of becoming infected.</p>
<p>Or am I stretching this metaphor too far?</p>
<p>So much for that. The decision we make on Thursday <!-- raw HTML omitted -->matters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, probably more than any visit to the polls in my lifetime. A decision to leave will be irreversible.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Not that I think we would be utterly unable to survive and thrive outside the EU. We&rsquo;d get by.  But we wouldn&rsquo;t be the best we could be, nor in the best position we could be in.</p>
<p>The EU is far from perfect, but so is the Westminster parliament, the Scottish one, and every other democracy.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But above all, if we&rsquo;re inside it, we are able to influence it &ndash; specifically, our democratically-elected representatives can &ndash; but if we&rsquo;re outside, all we can do is look in.</p>
<p>While having to abide by its oh-so-terribly-onerous regulations if we want to trade with it.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->editorial today<!-- raw HTML omitted --> advises us to “keep connected and inclusive, not angry and isolated,” and I think we can all get behind that, surely?</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t let me hear any of that “both sides as bad as each other” nonsense. The Remain<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> campaign has been lucklustre, certainly, and I’d have liked to see more dynamism from Jeremy Corbyn and the rest of the Labour leadership &ndash; if only to reduce the impression that it was all about Tory infighting, or that anyone should vote Leave because Cameron wants the opposite. But lacklustre does not equate to vicious, poisonous, and lying.</p>
<p>“Project Fear,” they called it. I even heard one of my colleagues accuse the Remain campaign of fearmongering. But fear is not being “mongered” when we have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->genuinely scary situation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>To end on a more cheerful note, if you only watch one video about the matter, make it this one from John Oliver:</p>

<p>Paul Cornell’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shadow Police<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series is part of a thriving subgenre now.

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I should have more to say about it than that, but really, that sums it up quite neatly.</p>
<p>But to try to go a bit deeper&hellip; The solar system is populated by various species or clans of posthumans, transhumans, AIs, uploaded minds, whatever. Earth is unrecognisable, though some people &ndash; seemingly fairly close to basic-human, though it&rsquo;s hard to judge, with so many strangenesses &ndash; still live there.</p>
<p>In some ways the biggest problems with this book, and its predecessor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Quantum Thief<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I read a few years ago, is the sheer number of new or repurposed words. None of these is ever explained: you have to gain an understanding of them from context, working it out as you go along.  This is a perfectly fine and valid method of storytelling, but here it all just gets a bit too much.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s my fault for the way I read the book: in disjointed fragments and sections, over weeks. Perhaps if I had read it in a more concentrated fashion, its meanings would have unwrapped themselves for me more easily, more thoroughly.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it&rsquo;s the storyteller&rsquo;s job to tell their story in a way that allows the reader to grasp it, to understand it. If he reader has difficulty with that, then it&rsquo;s not the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reader&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fault. It&rsquo;s the storyteller&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And yet, and yet, I enjoyed it, I finished it, I think i&rsquo;l probably read the third in the trilogy, which I believe is a thing. Eventually, after some time has passed on this one,</p>

<p>As of today, it still contains those links, but is a slightly more modern, sophisticated page, and has a new focus.</p>
<p>That new focus is job-hunting. I&rsquo;ve been working at Misys for more years than I care to think about &ndash; well,  Misys and one of its precursor companies, BIS, that it bought up in the 90s. And this is the first time I&rsquo;ve named it in public on the internet.</p>
<p>The reasons I never named it before are to do with keeping work and the rest of my life separate; and more to do with the fact that, as quite an elderly tech company, it didn&rsquo;t really have any concept of its staff having an online life outside of it &ndash; or even inside of it. At least until the last couple of years, when it launched a Twitter account and a YouTube channel&hellip; and the less said about them the better.</p>
<p>The same agedness is part of the reason why I have never contributed significantly to any open-source projects: my contract effectively disallowed it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m making it public now &ndash; and I&rsquo;m relaunching my front page &ndash; because I&rsquo;m not going to be working there much longer.</p>
<p>Even in the teen years of the 21st century, we are not past the time of jobs being moved offshore, it seems. Well some jobs, at least; and Misys have been moving development jobs to our &ndash; to their, as I should learn to say &ndash; offices in Manila and Bangalore for years. It was only a matter of time, really.</p>
<p>So about three weeks ago, me and the four other remaining developers in the team were told that we would be leaving at the end of June.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> It wasn&rsquo;t a shock, or even a surprise. In fact, I think we were all fairly pleased, in the end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been expecting it for at least a year, since the last of the developers in another team were sent on their way. To the extent that I&rsquo;ve been looking around, have been for a couple of interviews; because I didn&rsquo;t want to be just hanging on there for the redundancy money. That would be a terrible reason for staying. And while the work was still OK, I didn&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to find a job, so I felt I was in a position of strength.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I&rsquo;m quite pleased that none of those opportunities came to anything, because I do get the redundancy money. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my CV<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is up to date, and my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LinkedIn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and more importantly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stack Overflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> profiles are looking reasonably good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m treating this as an opportunity: I&rsquo;m keen to learn new things, have new experiences, and hopefully work in a development environment with releases more than twice a year, and with end-users I actually get to talk to.</p>
<p>So things are OK, but I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->am<!-- raw HTML omitted --> looking for a new job. So if you happen to know of anyone who&rsquo;s looking for a Senior Software Engineer, or Lead Programmer, or similar, with a lot of experience in Java and various other languages (and who is currently learning <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Swift<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), then send them my way.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mind being public about all this now, because I fully expect any company I work for in the future to have a more open, progressive attitude to its employees being citizens of the net.</p>
<p>Well, unless Apple are recruiting.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I have a 13-inch MacBook Pro, mid 2010 model. I bought it in about September or October 2010. Which means it&rsquo;s getting quite long in the tooth. The MacBooks have come on a long way in what they offer since then. Mine had 4GB of memory and a 320 GB hard drive. Nowadays they have solid-state drives by default and start from 16GB of memory, I think.</p>
<p>Thing is, it was still fine in most ways, but it was getting very, very slow. It wasn&rsquo;t too bad once everything was up and running, but waking it from sleep meant I&rsquo;d be seeing what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ginger out of The Wildhearts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> called the &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->spinning fucking rainbow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; (and everyone else calls the beachball) for a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->long<!-- raw HTML omitted --> time.</p>
<p>Even when it was up, just switching apps could trigger the slowness. So I was thinking about upgrading. But I figured there was life in the old beast yet. I took <!-- raw HTML omitted -->inspiration from Jason Snell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who writes of upgrading a 2009 model.</p>
<p>According to Apple, the most memory this model can support is 8GB. But according to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Other World Computing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, this particular model, though no others from around then, can actually take more &ndash; up to 16GB.</p>
<p>I went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Crucial<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is noted as the best site for Mac upgrades in the UK (OWC is only in the US). Its tool said it could only take 8GB. But I looked around various forums and decided that there was enough evidence that OWC were right. Plus memory is so cheap these days that the difference in price between 8 and 16 was very small.</p>
<p>So I took a chance and ordered 16GB, plus a 500GB SSD.</p>
<p>Installing the memory was trivially easy. You don&rsquo;t need more than a small Phillips screwdriver to open the case, and the memory modules themselves pop out and slot in very easily.</p>
<p>But with the two 8GB modules in, it wouldn&rsquo;t boot up. I just got  series of three beeps, repeated every few seconds.</p>
<p>A bit of googling told me that means &ldquo;bad memory,&rdquo; essentially.</p>
<p>I tried taking it out an putting it back in, swapping round which module was in which slot, and so on, but to no avail. I put the old memory back just to check that I hadn&rsquo;t damaged  something, and it started up like before.</p>
<p>So it looked like OWC were wrong, and I was restricted to 8GB. I was considering sending the memory back to Crucial and hoping I could get I refund. But then I tried one more thing. One of the new 8GB sticks along with one of the old 2GB ones.</p>
<p>And it booted up, smooth as a cliche.</p>
<p>Of course I tried swapping out one 8GB stick for the other, to check for the possibility that one of them actually was bad. But both of them worked. So it seems that this MacBook can take more than 8GB, but not as much as 16. Which is strange, but never mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to say, though, that the difference in performance wasn&rsquo;t obvious. But I didn&rsquo;t spend  lot of time with it like that, because I still had the SSD to install. That&rsquo;s very slightly more involved, needing as it does a Torx screwdriver. But it&rsquo;s very easy.</p>
<p>Before all that I had made sure my old hard drive was thoroughly backed up, you won&rsquo;t be surprised to hear.</p>
<p>I booted up in the new configuration and told the Mac to set itself up as a new installation. It downloaded El Capitan over the air and installed away.</p>
<p>There was one slight glitch in this process. Something went wrong with the installation and I started getting a kernel panic on bootup. I don&rsquo;t quite recall the details now, but I just reformatted the SSD and installed again, and it all went fine.</p>
<p>And the difference&hellip; The difference is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->astonishing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Even with many apps open (I currently have twelve), and a whole stack of tabs in Safari, using it is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->effortless<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Apps switch without the slightest lag. I can start anything up with only a few bounces. I&rsquo;ve hardly even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->seen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the rainbow.</p>
<p>Even Lightroom, which is the heaviest-weight app I use on here, starts in under ten seconds.</p>
<p>In short, this is the way a computer should be.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>That was lax of me, but in honour of the DVD of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Force Awakens<!-- raw HTML omitted --> having arrived, here we go now.

<p>All I really remembered in any detail was the dog-like pack-based beings, the Tines. Maybe a vague sense of the rogue superintelligent AI that caused all the problems.</p>
<p>And the &ldquo;Zones of Thought&rdquo; themselves, of course. A genius idea, which, in brief summary, is this: the further out from the galactic core you get, the more advanced the technology that is possible. Implicitly that includes biology. It&rsquo;s never explicitly stated, but it seems likely that deep inside the galaxy, in the &ldquo;Unthinking Depths,&rdquo; intelligence is not possible. Further out you get the &ldquo;Slow Zone&rdquo;, which is where Earth is.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Only sub-lightspeed travel is possible here, and machines cannot become intelligent.</p>
<p>But all this changes when you get to the galactic fringes, or the &ldquo;Beyond,&rdquo; where FTL and something close to AI are commonplace. And the further up the Beyond you go, the more this is true, until you reach the &ldquo;Transcend,&rdquo; where godlike AIs exist.</p>
<p>My memory was that the sections with the Tines were kind of annoying,  with a sense of, &ldquo;I want my space operas to be set in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->space<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with high tech; not on a mediaeval-level world with nothing more advanced than cartwheels.&quot;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But of course the story of the kids stranded on the Tines' World are both fundamental to the overall story, and at least as good as the galaxy-spanning main plot.</p>
<p>This book has gone from new, Hugo- &amp; Nebula-Award winner to SF Masterwork in what feels like a very short time. It was first published in 1991, which is 25 years ago. I suppose that&rsquo;s enough time to become a classic.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The accolades are thoroughly deserved, of course.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SF Masterworks edition<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has an introduction by Ken McLeod, which is well worth reading, and the whole is highly recommended by me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->almost<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sure I wrote about it already, but it seems not. I certainly can&rsquo;t find anything on either my Mac or iPhone.</p>
<p>But never mind. It&rsquo;s Stross and Doctorow. What&rsquo;s not to like? It&rsquo;s also, I think, something of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fix-up<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I certainly felt that I had read the early part of it before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a near-future, post-<!-- raw HTML omitted -->singularity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> world, where our hero, Huw, wakes up with a hangover to find that he has been invited to do jury duty.

<p>Huw is a singularity refusenik, who wants to remain on Earth as a baseline human, rather than take advantage of the ability to upload his personality and live forever in the orbital cloud.

<p>At least, that&rsquo;s the theory. It goes a long way from there, as you might expect.</p>

<p>Oh yes, the story. Hmm. It&rsquo;s not one of Dick&rsquo;s best, and a lot of it barely makes sense. Or at least, it makes sense in that it&rsquo;s internally consistent. But it&rsquo;s hard to believe. The UN conscripts people using a military-style draft, to go and live on the colonies &ndash; Mars is the only one we see, but several other planets and moons within the solar system are implied.</p>
<p>Colonists' lives are so hard and unpleasant that the only way they can get by &ndash; and the only entertainment they have, it seems &ndash; is to lose themselves in shared hallucinations induced by a drug called Can-D, during which they enter the world of characters called Perky Pat and her boyfriend Walt. These are inspired or induced using &ldquo;layouts&rdquo; &ndash; groupings of miniaturised artefacts that become part of Pat&rsquo;s life, and hence of the colonists' hallucinations.</p>
<p>In any group entering the shared experience, all the women always take the part of Pat, and all the men that of Walt. Which seems very limiting and heteronormative.</p>
<p>And, oh, yes, the sexual politics.</p>
<p>In some ways they&rsquo;re not too bad. The main character, Barney Mayerson, is a precog &ndash; oh yes, we have those, too, except when we forget that we do &ndash; and his assistant, Roni Fugate, ends up with his job, which is a quite a senior one at the company that makes &ldquo;mins&rdquo; &ndash; miniaturised items for use with the Perky Pat layouts. They use their precognitive powers to know what items are going to be fashionable. Other than that, the existence of reliable precognition seems to have had no impact on society.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why he wrote &ldquo;Minority Report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyway, at the start, she is also his lover, which seems to have happened as soon as she started working with him, almost as a given.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a significant part of the plot is driven by the fact that he has never got over his breakup with his wife &ndash; which I think might have been as long as twenty years ago &ndash; whom he dumped because she was bad for his career, or something.</p>
<p>In fact she&rsquo;s a highly skilled potter, who makes artefacts that are miniaturised for use in these famous layouts. Mayerson rejects her latest designs, saying they won&rsquo;t be successful, when Roni says they will. His attempt to screw up his ex&rsquo;s career leads her (and her new husband, who is acting as her salesman) into the arms of a rival corporation.</p>
<p>That body has been set up by the mysterious titular character. Palmer Eldritch has just returned from a ten-year trip to the Proxima system, whence he might have bought back a new drug, Chew-Z, that has similar properties to Can-D but is even more powerful.</p>
<p>Also global warming: the world is unliveably hot, so everyone stays in air-conditioned buildings (and makes things worse). In America, at least. We don&rsquo;t hear anything about the rest of the world. And forced &ldquo;evolution&rdquo;: some people go for expensive treatments in Swiss clinics, which give them bigger brains and leathery skin, at least on their head. Though sometimes it goes wrong and their intelligence decreases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all quite, quite mad, and the conclusion probably makes even less sense. But what the hell, it&rsquo;s fun enough while it lasts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>In some of them, though, the strangeness feels like incompleteness. They should be longer, go into more detail, or just have an ending. Several of the pieces are less true stories than vignettes, scenes. Not itself a bad thing, but it slightly belies the subtitle.</p>

<p>And that is largely because it has a story that mostly makes sense, and isn&rsquo;t too confusing. Sure, there are still plot holes, and flaws in the motivation; but overall it holds together pretty well.</p>
<p>Still not as well as any of the original trilogy, of course.</p>
<p>The biggest point that doesn&rsquo;t work for me is that we don&rsquo;t see why Anakin has any connection with Palpatine. He goes over to the latter far too easily. I don&rsquo;t so much mean his falling to the Dark Side; that was on the cards at least since he murdered the Sandpeople in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clones<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I mean the fact that Palpatine was suddenly asking him to spy on the Jedi Council, while the Council were equally-suddenly talking about his closeness to Palpatine. We had seen none of this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about all this lately, and I gather that much is made clearer in the ancillary material: novels, comics, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clone Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series that was made around the same time. But even if that is so, it means the movies fail. A movie has to be able to stand on its own. You can&rsquo;t expect the viewer to have read around the subject or watched spinoff series. You can just barely rely on them having seen the immediately-prior films.</p>
<p>Compare and contrast the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for example. You can watch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Avengers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> without having seen any of the prior films. Or enjoy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Agents of SHIELD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> without having seen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Captain America: The Winter Soldier<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for example. If you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seen the related material then it enhances the whole. But any element can stand without the others.</p>
<p>The love story between Anakin and Padmé remains unconvincing, and Padmé&rsquo;s death&hellip; well, I had gained the impression that she had died in childbirth, which seemed implausible in such a technologically-advanced society. In fact she died of a broken heart, or just gave up the ghost, or something. Which would be more plausible (if still not very) had she not just given birth. It seems more likely that a new mother would tend to fight for life to protect her babies. She died because the plot needed her to, in the end. If, as a creator, you have to do that kind of thing, you should at least find a more convincing way to do it.</p>
<p>Anyway, now I&rsquo;ve seen all of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> movies, and I&rsquo;m ready for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Force Awakens<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Which is good, because I&rsquo;ll be seeing it in about 30 hours.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Were this last pair as good as &ldquo;The Empty Child&rdquo;/&ldquo;The Doctor Dances&rdquo; or &ldquo;Blink&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s hard to say definitively, because those were so <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shockingly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> good when they hit us. But I think in time we&rsquo;ll say so. I don&rsquo;t doubt that Capaldi and the production team will win BAFTAs this year, and I&rsquo;m sure that one of the last two will get the Hugo.</p>
<p>Awards may not mean that much (though let&rsquo;s face it, they do) but when you see an award-worthy performance, or read something that you know is likely to win, that deserves to win &ndash; you know you&rsquo;ve experienced something special.</p>
<p>And we experienced something very special in this season of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> And particularly in the last three episodes.</p>
<p>I just read a foolish comment on a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tor.com post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about how great Capaldi is. It said, in effect, &ldquo;That episode was only about the gender &amp; skin-colour switching regeneration.&rdquo; Yes, that was it: it was about that one thing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and nothing else<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a nice touch.</p>
<p>One thing I haven&rsquo;t seen or heard mentioned is how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->terrified<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Time Lords were of him &ndash; well, Rassilon, at least: one guy, and they send a vast floating gun platform to bring him in. Of course, it turns out that Rassilon was right to be  afraid.</p>
<p>One thing about this episode and more importantly, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the previous<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, seems to be causing people some confusion. The Doctor didn&rsquo;t spend two billion years (or whatever) in the clockwork castle. Two billion years worth of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->copies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of him &ndash; each with some awareness of its past iterations, triggered by the word &ldquo;bird&rdquo; &ndash; go through a near-identical experience.</p>
<p>Though <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hell Bent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> proves that even The Doctor &ndash; or Stephen Moffat &ndash; is confused by this.</p>
<p>Mind you, the planet on which the castle is built does experience all that time, we must assume, as The Doctor observes how the stars have changed.</p>
<p>What the episode does do is address the old philosophical question of whether matter transmitters make copies. In the Whoniverse at least, they do.</p>
<p>Unless the whole thing is a simulation, including the changing stars.</p>
<p>Anyway, masterful, glorious work. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the Christmas special.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Because here we are again: our elected representatives are banging spears on shields and baying with the desire to follow a weak, shoddy prime minister to war.</p>
<p>Classic political distraction, of course: things are bad at home (to say nothing of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the government&rsquo;s party<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), so let&rsquo;s have a war to distract the populace; the electorate; the &ldquo;patient millions/Who put them into power,&rdquo; as Billy Bragg <!-- raw HTML omitted -->put it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So far, so unsurprising. But it&rsquo;s Labour MPs who really bother me. I thought perhaps we had turned a corner with the election of Jeremy Corbyn. That maybe we would return to being a proper opposition, by actually opposing Tory excesses. And by doing so, show the nation that here is a true alternative to the politics of the last couple of decades; to right-wing versus slightly-less-right-wing. Show the potential for a more peace-loving Britain.</p>
<p>But here they all are, the party grandees, howling for bombs alongside the Tories. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, of course: it was a Labour government that took us into Iraq twelve years ago. In my defence &ndash; and theirs, to some extent &ndash; we were deceived , then &ndash; them by that dossier, us by them. Millions marched against it,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but many thought that there must be something to all this talk of us being 45-minutes away from an attack. That the government must <!-- raw HTML omitted -->know something<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Back then my son was nearly six. When we told him &ndash; in an age-appropriate way, as they say &ndash; that it looked like there was going to be a war &ndash; his first response was, &ldquo;Will I have to go away?&rdquo; Those tales of World War II evacuated kids burn deep for a Londoner.</p>
<p>We reassured him that no, the war would be far away, and wouldn&rsquo;t affect us directly. Two years later we were proved wrong, when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the war came to his hometown<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>And just two weeks ago the current war came to Paris. Does anyone doubt, if our leaders go ahead and escalate this war, that we&rsquo;ll see it come back to British streets? Maybe London again. Maybe Birmingham, Manchester, Belfast, Glasgow.</p>
<p>More blood on British streets. Blood, which &ndash; along with that of the innocents who die in Syria under RAF bombs &ndash; will be at least partly on the hands of the MPs who go through the division lobbies with the government tomorrow.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Well.</p>
<p>I have to say (and spoilers here for &ldquo;Face the Raven&rdquo;, if you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet): that was companion-exit that guarantees they won&rsquo;t be able to bring her back.</p>
<p>OK, yes, nothing is forever in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and there are already rumours or suggestions that Clara will be appearing in flashbacks or similar in the next two episodes. But that really felt properly final.</p>
<p>And I have to say, I hope it stays that way. Nothing against Clara, or Jenna Coleman &ndash; I think she was a good companion played by a very good actor &ndash; but it just feels that they&rsquo;ve done too much of bringing companions back. Sure, we all love to see them again, but really? She&rsquo;s gone out with a heroic and tragic last scene. It would cheapen it to bring her back.</p>
<p>Unless there was a very good reason, of course.</p>
<p>It occurs to me: if the planned new spinoff programme, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Class<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is to be set in and around Coal Hill School, where Clara was teaching: what does her death mean for that, for the characters in it? Presumably some of them will be her students, or teachers who knew her.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to Clara, and the Raven. And maybe her death wish?</p>
<p>I was pleased that she mentioned Danny Pink at the end, because I&rsquo;ve been thinking that it was strange that neither she nor The Doctor had mentioned him in this season. It seemed that she really hadn&rsquo;t had a chance go grieve properly &ndash; or hadn&rsquo;t let herself do so.</p>
<p>Though we don&rsquo;t know how long is supposed to have passed. It could be a year, two, since the events of &ldquo;Death in Heaven&rdquo;. Which doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;d have stopped grieving &ndash; certainly not that she&rsquo;d have forgotten him. But she could have got to a place where she could carry on without always thinking of him.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s her mood this series, her mad drive for more adventures, her carelessness &ndash; best shown in this very episode with the way she hung out of the Tardis<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So if we want to psychoanlayse her, we can say that she has spent the last ten episodes (and maybe longer) running away from Danny&rsquo;s death, from her own feelings about it; or running towards her own eventual death, her sacrifice.</p>
<p>This episode for me was one of the best I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time. I was considered quite contentious in my family when I said I thought that the current season was the best of New-Who. That led to much discussion of other past seasons, and my eventual acquiescence into the idea that it&rsquo;s mainly the best because it&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s happening now. Like my friend Paul <!-- raw HTML omitted -->said a while back<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: &ldquo;My favourite episode of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? The next one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I think the truth of it is that it has been a very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->even<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series: not great highs (except maybe this very episode) &ndash; no &ldquo;Blink&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances&rdquo; or &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s Day&rdquo;. But no real lows, either (arguably the previous episode, but I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->still think it was worthwhile<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.) An entire season (so far) of solid, strong episodes, leading to a climax like this &ndash; and who knows what will come next?</p>
<p>I note in passing that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this reviewer thinks like me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Anyway. There is much more I could say &ndash; like who are the &ldquo;they&rdquo; who have kidnapped The Doctor? The obvious answer would be Davros and the Daleks, possibly with help from Missy. That would bookend the season nicely, and make some sense of Ashildr asking for his &ldquo;Confession Dial&rdquo;. But that might be too obvious.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s enough for now. Quoth the Raven, &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neverwhere<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s all about hidden London, isn&rsquo;t it?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I enjoyed it immensely &ndash; well, quite a lot &ndash; but I just wish sometimes they would take the trouble to come up with good, rational explanations for the events. Relatively simple steps, only needing a few extra words &ndash; or different words &ndash; in the script, could make these episodes be so much better.</p>
<p>The critical example of a story like this from last season is &ldquo;<a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2014/10/07/space-bat-angel-dragons-hatch-in-their-own-way/">Kill the Moon</a>&rdquo;. As I wrote at that link, they could relatively easily have included a few words that would have made the idea less preposterous. It wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be good science, but it would at least be less-ridiculous science than the explanation that was actually given.</p>
<p>So too here, then, with &ldquo;Sleep No More.&rdquo; The atmosphere and style of the episode were great. And the plot was fine. It was just the execution of the plot, including in particular the explanation for the problem, that let it down.</p>
<p>Let me explain what I mean. The plot, in summary, was: In found footage a mad scientist tells us the story of some soldiers investigating a space station that has dropped out of communication. The crew have been turned into dust-zombies by a machine that enables them to function on five minutes sleep a day. The explanation for the dust conversion is stupid.</p>
<p>The Doctor and Clara, of course, have arrived on the station and help to investigate. Clara gets sucked into the sleep machine, which means she will become a dust monster too.</p>
<p>Our heroes and the surviving troops escape in the TARDIS, and the mad scientist reveals he is a dust monster and is spreading the infection via the very recording we&rsquo;re watching.</p>
<p>As I write that I realise that the whole Clara/infection thing wasn&rsquo;t resolved, and nor, of course, was the infection via radio business (it reminded me slightly of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Snow Crash<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, incidentally). So maybe they will revisit it, next week or later.</p>
<p>But the ostensible explanation &ndash; before we got the radio part from the mad scientist &ndash; was that somehow the sleep-compression machine caused the sleep in the corner of your eyes to &ndash; what, grow sentient and consume humans, generating more of itself in the process? It&rsquo;s hard even to explain what they were getting at.</p>
<p>Yet all they had to do was to say it was an alien intelligence that hade got into the mad scientist&rsquo;s head and convinced him that helping it to spread was the right thing. then even have the sleep-machines infecting people via nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The aliens could even be cousin-species of the <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Vashta_Nerada">Vashta Nerada</a>, as there&rsquo;s a certain similarity.</p>
<p>Of course, that way we&rsquo;d lose the radio-transmission-based spread, which was a nice touch too. So maybe nanotech that is quiescent until activated by the code sent in the transmssion.</p>
<p>Either way, it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of thought to come up with an idea that doesn&rsquo;t break the story, but which <em>also</em> doesn&rsquo;t jerk the viewer out of their suspension of disbelief.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t get me started on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Trek<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-style powered orbit.</p>
<p>In my family we have concluded that what the show needs is, like UNIT, a Scientific Advisor.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>This was a great pair of episodes. True, some will have found it hard to understand what was going on in the first episode; and true also, the whole Zygon plot might not have entirely made sense (why, in particular, do they have electric zappy powers now, and why does that turn people into sparking wire wool?) But the overall mood, and tone, and writing, were fantastic.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fanservice. The references to Harry Sullivan; the portrait of the first Doctor over the safe; &ldquo;Five Rounds Rapid!&rdquo; (Which, I discover, is the title of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nicholas Courtney&rsquo;s autobiography<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.) I Loved it all.</p>
<p>This season feels to me like it&rsquo;s really solid. There are no real highs: no &ldquo;Blink&rdquo;, no &ldquo;The Empty Child&rdquo; or &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s Day&rdquo;. But there have been no really weak episodes yet either.</p>
<p>On second watching I caught an interesting snippet. When the Doctor is telling Zygella why he didn&rsquo;t press the big button, he says he &ldquo;let Clara Oswald get into [his] head.&rdquo; Then he says, &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t leave.&rdquo; Maybe that&rsquo;ll be the big secret reveal of this season: Clara doesn&rsquo;t leave after all.</p>
<p>No, I realise that can&rsquo;t be so, as official BBC announcements have been made. But it was an interesting change from the heavy-handed foreshadowing of her departure that we&rsquo;ve seen. Clara has been the Doctor&rsquo;s &ndash; and our &ndash; companion for a long time now, and it&rsquo;ll be strange for all of us to adjust to someone new.</p>
<p>I loved the Doctor&rsquo;s speech &ndash; soliloquy, you might say &ndash; that reinstated the ceasefire. It&rsquo;s his statement of Doctoriness.</p>
<p>Still wondering if there&rsquo;s a big thing for this season. I mean, apart from Clara leaving. It has to be something to do with hybrids of some kind &ndash; I noticed that the second part didn&rsquo;t use that word, though the first did. The Osgoods could be said to be a hybrid, but I can&rsquo;t see them coming back before the end of this run. There&rsquo;s the Dalek/Time Lord thing, which will have to play out at some point.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the Minister of War &ndash; which could just be a throwaway name like the Nightmare Child; but I think it was placed too specifically for that. And Lady Me, or Ashildr. I fully expect to see her again.</p>
<p>I expect we&rsquo;ll have to wait for the closing two-parter, &ldquo;Heaven Sent&rdquo;/&ldquo;Hell Bent&rdquo; to find out.</p>
<p>But before that we&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;Sleep No More&rdquo; on Saturday. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a two-parter with the one after, &ldquo;Face the Raven&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to finding out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Plenty of Robin in this one, and it&rsquo;s probably the best of the three. Certainly better than the last one.</p>
<p>Strangest thing about it is the music. By which I mean: the title is taken from a song by Blue Öyster Cult, and quotes from them precede most of the chapters (some chapters have titles, and those are the titles of BÖC songs).</p>
<p>Now, I had no idea that Patti Smith wrote some lyrics for BÖC, but apparently she did<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Still on a musical note, in passing, one of the ancillary characters roadies for a band who are called Death Cult. Since JK Rowling is about the same age as me, and since she obviously pays attention to music, I would expect her to know that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Cult<!-- raw HTML omitted --> used to be known as Death Cult, and before that as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Southern Death Cult<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But perhaps you had to read the music papers in the 80s to know about that kind of stuff.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The ending is a tad unsatisfying, as it leaves a number of things unresolved &ndash; which is fine, as there will no doubt be more books &ndash; and doesn&rsquo;t really give us enough time post-denoument to decompress with the characters.</p>

<p>Excellent that they managed not to include the word &ldquo;Dalek&rdquo; in the title of a Dalek story. A genuine surprise when the boy in the minefield said his name.</p>
<p>And great, great interplay between Missy and Clara, especially.</p>
<p>But if we assume, as we must, that the Magician is The Doctor and Missy is the Witch , does that make Clara both the Apprentice and the Familar? Or is Davros one of all of the above? It&rsquo;s all very mysterious.</p>
<p>And Dalek/Time Lord hybrids? This can&rsquo;t end well.</p>

<p>OK, I thought, someone probably dressed up for a kids' party. It was a Saturday, as I recall. &ldquo;Oh, yeah, where?&rdquo; I glanced around, but couldn&rsquo;t see any white faces or red noses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a bus shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clown? On a bus shelter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A clown. You know, from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guess I must have been able to give some explanation of what &ldquo;clone&rdquo; means, to a five-year-old. But it wasn&rsquo;t till last weekend that we finally saw the relevant movie.</p>
<p>And as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->before<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I&rsquo;ve been led to believe. Keeping your expectations low always helps.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t great, it&rsquo;s true. In particular I wasn&rsquo;t convinced by Anakin and Padmé falling in love. Anakin, yes, but Padmé, really, no.</p>
<p>I had a hard time working out what the sides were in the big battle. The clones end up fighting on the side of the Republic? I didn&rsquo;t expect that.</p>
<p>And this bothers me: if you are an assemblage of planets joined together in common cause by treaty, and some of those planets decide they want to leave &ndash; going to war over it should be the furthest thing from your mind. It would be like if a country wanted to leave the EU, and the rest of the EU formed a vast army to force them to stay in it. That&rsquo;s not the action of a peaceful democratic entity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->insane<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Even if you win and make the would-be-leavers stay, you&rsquo;ve now got a load of people &ndash; whole <!-- raw HTML omitted -->worlds<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; who are actively hostile to the grouping they are within. That can&rsquo;t be healthy.</p>
<p>Now, if a subset leaves peacefully, and then war developed later on, that would be more believeable. After all, we acknowledge the EU&rsquo;s effect of helping to keep Europe peaceful these past seventy years. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I am strongly against the idea of Britain leaving.</p>
<p>But most importantly of all: you can&rsquo;t say &ldquo;federation starships&rdquo; and mean the bad guys. I know they were talking about the Trade Federation, but &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->federation starship<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->means something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in SF, and to hear it used here was really jarring.

<p>It&rsquo;s unusual and intriguing to see what was effectively a two-part story with different writing credits for each part. Yet there was no real need for these two episodes to be shown back-to-back, and indeed I partly got the sense that they might have been stronger if they had been separated by a few other stories.</p>
<p>On the  other hand I&rsquo;m fairly sure that the second part had to happen now because they&rsquo;re gearing up to something. Maisie Williams&rsquo;s Ashildr or &ldquo;Me&rdquo; character is, I feel sure, fundamental to this season&rsquo;s overall story, if it has one.</p>
<p>After the first part I had the idea that Ashildr was going to become &ldquo;The Minister of War&rdquo;, the mysterious figure that was referred to by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->O&rsquo;Donnell in &ldquo;Under the Lake&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as being something that 1980 was before &ndash; along with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the moon blowing up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Harold Saxon.</p>
<p>Such an ominous-sounding figure  is surely going to be an enemy of The Doctor, and at the end of &ldquo;The Girl Who Died&rdquo; he had created a near immortal who might not be at all happy with him about the situation, and who might use her longevity to gain power.</p>
<p>As indeed was the case, as we saw in &ldquo;The Woman Who Lived&rdquo;. However by the end of the second part I was less sure that Ashildr&rsquo;s future role will be that one. It seems fairly likely that she&rsquo;s going to have one, though, with her promise to pick up the pieces after The Doctor runs away, the giant foreshadowing of Clara&rsquo;s departure, and of course her appearance in the background of Clara&rsquo;s pupil&rsquo;s photo.</p>
<p>However I get the feeling that her intentions will be more benign.</p>
<p>All just wild speculation, of course.</p>
<p>This pair of episodes were probably the weakest of the series so far, but they were still very good. Effective  lightening of the mood with the comedy elements, while still not shying away from the darkness.</p>
<p>One last thought: in the pub scene at the end there were two people at a table in the foreground. I haven&rsquo;t checked yet, but I&rsquo;m fairly sure that the shot was a visual allusion to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandman<!-- raw HTML omitted --> episode whose title escapes me,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but in which Death agrees with her brother that she won&rsquo;t take this one guy, and Morpheus meets him in taverns every hundred years. Which would tie in with the immortality theme, of course.</p>
<p>Oh, and: on Jason Snell&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Incomparable Flashcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the second part (which episode Mr Snell wasn&rsquo;t on, but never mind), the alien was likened to an &ldquo;angry Cowardly Lion&rdquo;. Now I&rsquo;m sure there was also a mention by The Doctor of Ashildr&rsquo;s heart &ldquo;rusting&rdquo; or &ldquo;needing lubrication&rdquo;, or some such &ndash; which was surely a reference to the Tin Woodsman. Which makes The Doctor The Scarecrow?</p>
<p>And Clara is Toto, of course, since Missy already likened her to a small dog.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll all make sense eventually.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>The Beethoven bit at the start was unnecessary: a rare example of the modern show not expecting the viewer to keep up, but assuming they&rsquo;ll need an explanation &ndash; a pre-explanation in this case, but still. (Also breaking the fourth wall; most unusual.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe some people would have been a bit lost at the end without it. Maybe all of us would have missed the point and weeks later we&rsquo;d have gone &ldquo;Wait, but he only did that because he &ndash;&rdquo; Which has its own pleasure too, of course.</p>
<p>My main concern was that The Doctor let O&rsquo;Donnell die, without any apparent remorse. I have a feeling that might come back to haunt him.</p>
<p>Also: loving the two-parters. Proper cliffhangers and all. How about a traditional four-parter next season?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>As a work in translation, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Three-Body Problem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fits well within the parameters of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Tempest Challenge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which, as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I told you<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I’m taking this year. It’s also this year’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hugo winner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so I was keen to read it for that reason.</p>
<p>Right at the start I felt a mild sense of annoyance, because it was only then that I realised it is part of an incomplete trilogy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I’m not keen on starting unfinished serieses (it is so a word).</p>
<p>I finished it last night with a sense of surprise. According to my Kindle I was only at 85%; more importantly it didn’t exactly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like the end, though to be fair I wasn’t quite sure where it could go from that point. I knew there were notes from the author and the translator, but they surely couldn’t be that long?</p>
<p>They couldn’t. But it turns out that the digital copy contains an extract from the next book in the series. I’m not sure how I feel about this trend in general. I don’t think I’ve ever read one of them. But I do think they’re getting too damn big: this one was fully 10% of the file, according to the Kindle.
One tenth of a novel is not in fact that novel, but an extract from the next one? I don’t think that’s a great trend.
But to the content. What did I actually think of the work?
Umm&hellip; mixed. I enjoyed it overall, am glad I read it, and will probably read the sequels. But it has problems that I don&rsquo;t think are just caused by my cultural expectations. Though they might be: the translator, Ken Liu, in his postscript says:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Which is fair enough, and for &ldquo;American&rdquo; it&rsquo;s safe to read &ldquo;British&rdquo;, as well. But perhaps the most important literary technique &ndash; or at least, the admonition most often drummed into beginning writers &ndash; is &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo;. As I have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->argued<!-- raw HTML omitted --> myself, it&rsquo;s not a rule that can or should be set in stone; but there are times when violating it comes across as clumsy at best.</p>
<p>There are many such times in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Three-Body Problem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Long sections of characters' lives are told to us as a history. Similarly with the sections that take place in the &ldquo;Three Body&rdquo; game.</p>
<p>There are some great ideas here; in particular the best use of monomolecular fibres since &ndash; was it &ldquo;Johnny Mnemonic&rdquo;? One of William Gibson&rsquo;s shorts, anyway.
It&rsquo;s also worth reading for the historical parts: the terror of living through China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution is well evoked. But the aliens are hard to believe in.</p>
<p>And part of the initial setup: scientists are killing themselves because things seem to have gone fundmentally wrong with physics. I found that unconvincing. If as a scientist you find things not behaving as you expect &ndash; even seemingly randomly &ndash; you don&rsquo;t give up on science and life; you try to find a new theory to fit the facts.</p>
<p>Lastly, I don&rsquo;t think we ever found out what&rsquo;s supposed to happen at the end of the countdown.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t mean to do a hatchet job. I did enjoy it, and as I say, I&rsquo;ll probably read the sequels. Would it have won the Hugo in a less puppy-infested year? Maybe. You can never tell.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I just voted, and guess what? For Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a member of the party before.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I always thought that I was too independent to toe a party line; too many of my anarchist ideals, forged in the fires of punk, still stood.</p>
<p>Well, maybe. But my anarchism, such as it was, was always on the socialist wing. And I recognise the idealism that drove it. I&rsquo;d like to think that humans could live without governments and leaders &ndash; that we are perfectible, and could form a working society through cooperation. But the fact is, of course, that that is not yet the case. And until it is, there are things worth standing up for, worth believing in. Worth fighting for.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to toe a line; but in May we crossed a line. After five years of a Tory government in all but name, we have a named one. David Cameron and his regime will go down in history as worse than Thatcher&rsquo;s; but until he does go down, we have to deal with the effects of it.</p>
<p>On the morning after the election I resolved to join the Labour party and do what I could to help. This wasn&rsquo;t about electing a new leader, though I realised that would be part of it. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t about Jeremy Corbyn: I made the decision before Ed Miliband had even resigned, and enacted it before the leadership candidates had been nominated.</p>
<p>And for what it&rsquo;s worth, I joined as a full member, not one of these £3 Supporters that we&rsquo;ve been hearing so much about.</p>
<p>I think the aftermath of the Scottish referendum had some effect on my decision. Seeing how the failure of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote energised the SNP and led many supporters to join led me to hope that something similar would happen with Labour. As indeed it has.</p>
<p>Anyway, getting back to that choice of leader. It&rsquo;s long past time that Labour had a woman as its leader, but neither of those standing are right for me. Where we are right now, Corbyn&rsquo;s views most closely match my own values. When he says things like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ndash; &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Economy in 2020<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>that is exactly the kind of thing I&rsquo;ve been saying about tax for years.</p>
<p>There is much else. I&rsquo;m not convinced about leaving NATO, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a fundamental policy. I do think we shouldn&rsquo;t waste vast amounts of money on replacing Trident. The cold war is over, more or less.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> And even if Russia is getting alarmingly expansionist these days, a British not-really-independent nuclear missile submarine is going to worry them much.</p>
<p>Corbyn might not be electable &ndash; I doubt that analysis, but let&rsquo;s go with it for now &ndash; but he should at least lead a Labour party in opposition that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actually opposes the government<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Which, with its slim majority, could actually be vulnerable.</p>

<p>It <!-- raw HTML omitted -->won the Clarke Award<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as I&rsquo;m sure you know. All I knew about it when I heard the result, when I saw Mandel&rsquo;s acceptance video at the ceremony, was the title. But it&rsquo;s a badge of recognition, if nothing else; a clear signal that a group of people, of our peers, perhaps, think it&rsquo;s one of the best books &ndash; maybe <em>the</em> best &ndash; released in the last year.</p>
<p>I downloaded it on Kindle (I think there was a special offer). I hadn&rsquo;t read any reviews, not even the blurb. But it&rsquo;s called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Station Eleven<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: it&rsquo;s got to be about a space station, right?</p>
<p>Well, &ldquo;Station Eleven&rdquo; is a space station of sorts. But this isn&rsquo;t a story set on it, or in space at all. Well, except inasmuch as Earth is in space, which of course is totally.</p>
<p>Thing is, if I&rsquo;d known this was actually set mainly in a post-end-of-civilisation dystopia, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have read it it at all. Such scenarios really don&rsquo;t appeal to me much, at face value at least. I&rsquo;m always reminded of a call for stories in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interzone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> many years ago, which asked for &ldquo;radical, hard SF&rdquo;; but which specifically said they didn&rsquo;t want the kind of post-holocaust story where the hero gazes wistfully at a can of baked beans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an image which has stuck with me, but this is not that kind of story (though there are elements of scavenging among the ruins).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not set entirely after the fall of civilisation. In part it tells the life story of a successful actor (who dies on stage while playing Lear right at the start of the first chapter).</p>
<p>I note that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mandel herself seems to reject the SF label<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and my thoughts on it &ndash; while loving it to bits &ndash; centred around wondering why she chose to tell the story of a present-day actor framed or intertwined within the death of civilisation. Looking at some reviews now I see that people treat the central theme as being the attempt to keep culture alive. And while that is an important aspect, I don&rsquo;t really see it as being what the book is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Particularly if we are to consider it as literary fiction<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> wherein characters are usually the main focus. As such it&rsquo;s mainly the stories of the actor and of the young woman who started out as a child actor who was onstage when he died, but who survived the plague.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->conclusion of this review at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> sums it up well:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>A number of sources had led me to the belief that Zane, at Radio One, had effectively been the new John Peel. Nobody can live up to that claim, I suspect, but to me it meant that he must have a particular set of talents and abilities:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve now heard Zane on Beats 1 a couple of times, and he certainly fulfils the first three of those criteria. But he fails dramatically on the fourth.</p>
<p>The thing with Peelie was, he played the track. He respected it, gave it space to succeed or fail on its own merit. Certainly he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;This is the new one from so-and-so, and I think it&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; or whatever; but then he&rsquo;d let you hear the record. The actual record. All of it. The whole thing.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Zane does not do that.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m afraid he talks over the records. And not just over instrumental intros or &ldquo;chasing the fade,&rdquo; either. I&rsquo;ve heard him popping up right in the middle of a song with a word or two.</p>
<p>One of the people who spoke highly of Zane was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Myke Hurley<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Relay FM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the podcast network. In particular I had heard him talking on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Upgrade podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about what a good guy Zane was.</p>
<p>So when I heard Mr Lowe talking over the tracks, I tweeted with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#AskUpgrade<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag, which is one of their feedback mechanisms:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They read out my question on the next episode, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->45, I think<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Make said I sounded &ldquo;very angry&rdquo;, which I wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; just disappointed. And then we exchanged a few tweets:</p>

<p>This perhaps explains why the character of Anyanwu, who, as you&rsquo;ll recall, I felt was slightly disappointing in the first book, is completely sidelined and, indeed, thrown away, in this one.</p>
<p>The other reason is that the focus has moved on to a new generation of Doro&rsquo;s descendants. We are in mid to late 20th-century America, and his breeding programme is finally beginning to pay off. More spectacularly than he had ever imagined, it seems, as some of his telepaths &ndash; who up until now have not been able to bear being near each other &ndash; form a kind of group or meld they call the Pattern.</p>
<p>This makes them able to both work and live together, and increases their power and effectiveness enormously.</p>
<p>Things ensue. It&rsquo;s good, but still feels kind of weak to me. I enjoyed it, but it wasn&rsquo;t that compelling.</p>
<p>Also I thought I had read this one, years ago, but none of it was even the slightest bit familiar to me, so I guess not.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Not too spooky &ndash; I doubt their bots are reading my blog. It&rsquo;s nothing more than the fact that I&rsquo;ve bought DBT albums from Amazon before. Only the timing was surprising &ndash; plus the fact that I had no idea that the album was coming out. Though <!-- raw HTML omitted -->further research<!-- raw HTML omitted --> shows that it&rsquo;s not actually a new album, making Amazon&rsquo;s prompt slightly more suspect again.</p>
<p>Anyway the interesting thing about this album &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Fine Print: A Collection Of Oddities And Rarities 2003-2008<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; is that it contains a track called &lsquo;Play it All Night Long&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m assuming that this must be a cover of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Warren Zevon&rsquo;s song of the same name<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Now, that song is a dissection of DBT&rsquo;s beloved Lynyrd Skynyrd. Or at least it uses &ldquo;that dead band&rsquo;s song&rdquo; as part of its critique of the South. For DBT to cover it must be an example of &ldquo;the duality of the southern thing,&rdquo; of which they speak extensively on <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Southern Rock Opera<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Of course, large parts of that album are about Skynyrd, so covering a song that is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also<!-- raw HTML omitted --> partly about them isn&rsquo;t much of a stretch. Thing is, Zevon&rsquo;s song is less than positive about the South as a whole, or Skynyrd by implication. Not, of course, that the DBTs are entirely positive about the South; that duality again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Play it All Night Long&rsquo; is also the only known song &ndash; known by me, at least &ndash; to contain the word &ldquo;brucellosis&rdquo;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I read this, and I sort of enjoyed it, but I wasn&rsquo;t entirely happy with it.</p>
<p>There are two main characters, both of whom appear to be functionally immortal, though with different mechanisms for keeping them alive. The shapeshifting, self-healing (and healer of others) Anyanwu is an African woman in the seventeenth century when we meet her. She is already two or three hundred years old.</p>
<p>The male immortal, Doro, is even older. For perhaps thousands of years he has survived by stealing bodies. His consciousness hops from his current one to another when the latter threatens him, or just when he chooses it. The personality of his destination body is of course destroyed in the hop, and the body he leaves also dies. Anyanwu is attracted to his power and the fact that they are apparently the only such long-lived people on Earth, but is repelled by the mechanism of his survival.</p>
<p>As she is by his long-term (<em>really</em> long-term) project to try to breed people with special abilities &ndash; many of the subjects of which are, or may be, distant descendants of her, or of his original people (most of whom he killed in panic when he first &ldquo;died&rdquo; and found himself in a new body).</p>
<p>I was annoyed at Anyanwu as a character at times, by the way she didn&rsquo;t resist Doro when he had her do things she didn&rsquo;t want to do. But he is an expert manipulator and is willing to threaten her kids to bend her to his will. And I guess that cleverly evokes the reality of women&rsquo;s situation often in history, and certainly at that time.</p>
<p>This is the start of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seed to Harvest<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series, and I&rsquo;m keen to see where it goes.</p>

<p>There are two questions there:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the radio they were talking about &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->shy Tories<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; as an answer to 1. That&rsquo;s a term that was coined after the 1992 election, apparently, to describe all those people who voted Tory but who had never let anyone know that that was what they were planning. I remember the aftermath of that one, and the thing that struck me was all those people I worked with who read the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Telegraph<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ldquo;for the sport&rdquo;; and how smug they looked that morning.</p>
<p>I became wise to that. But nowadays no-one comes into work with a paper any more, so it&rsquo;s harder to tell such things. And how would it help, even if they did and you could?</p>
<p>The thing is, the pre-election polls must have been deceived.</p>
<p>Of course, no-one is obliged to tell the truth to a pollster. No-one is obliged to even answer their questions. But if you do agree to answer their questions: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why would you lie?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I can think of only two possible reasons. Maybe you want to deliberately skew the poll results. But that seems unlikely. Sure, some people will feel like that; a few. But not lots. Not enough to actually have a deceptive effect.</p>
<p>And the other reason why, if you answered, you might lie; the only other reason I can think that might make people lie to a pollster.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re embarrassed about your answer. Or stronger: because you&rsquo;re <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ashamed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of it.</p>
<p>Shame can be a powerful influencer.</p>
<p>And it makes sense that people would be ashamed of voting Tory. Most of us were brought up to know that we shouldn&rsquo;t be selfish; that sharing is best, and just being out for yourself is bad. We learn that at our mother&rsquo;s knee, generally.</p>
<p>This tweet from Irvine Welsh sums up what I think is a good approach;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re reasonably comfortably off, and you&rsquo;re voting for the party that you think is going to make you better off &ndash; no matter how wrong you might be;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and if you&rsquo;re doing it mainly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->because<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you think that &ndash; then you are selfish and ought to be ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p>And in that attempt to answer the first question, I appear to have answered the second one as well. Why did all those Tory voters make such bad choices?</p>
<p>Selfishness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll hurt us all.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Anyway, the title clearly derives from how unlikely it is that anyone (of a certain generation or three, at least) will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have seen it.</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re worrying, I saw the original &ndash; back when it was just called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, without the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Episode IV: A New Hope<!-- raw HTML omitted --> subtitle &ndash; in the cinema (probably second run, not first, but still). And the second and third, of course.</p>
<p>But then there was the prequel trilogy. To be honest, when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Phantom Menace<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came out, I don&rsquo;t think I was all that interested. I had known from early on that Lucas had planned the original as part of the middle trilogy of three. But by the time the prequels started, it had been so <!-- raw HTML omitted -->long<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that it just didn&rsquo;t seem very important, you know?</p>
<p>And more importantly, in 1999 when it came out, I had a small child. We weren&rsquo;t going to many films that weren&rsquo;t aimed at like two-year olds. And after that, there was always something more interesting, more pressing to see&hellip;</p>
<p>I mislead you slightly, here. I did, in fact, see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Phantom Menace<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, after a fashion: on a shonky old VHS, with a three-year old sweetly chattering on the sofa next to me throughout. It hardly counts. And I definitely haven&rsquo;t seen the others.</p>
<p>And I know everyone says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother, don&rsquo;t waste your time, they&rsquo;re terrible;&rdquo; but they can only say that because they&rsquo;ve seen them. And now &ndash; now there&rsquo;s a new one coming down the line. Episode VII, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Force Awakens<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is due out in December, and I&rsquo;ll certainly want to see it. Of course, it will follow on from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Return of the Jedi<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it probably won&rsquo;t matter if you haven&rsquo;t seen episodes I-III; but it just wouldn&rsquo;t feel right to not see them.</p>
<p>So I intend to watch the prequel trilogy. I was going to start today &ndash; the fourth of May be with you, and all that &ndash; but events got in the way. Still, over the next few weeks I&rsquo;ll watch all three, and report back here.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I was somewhere in the middle of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->third book<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I read this year when I heard of it, and I realised that all my reading so far was books by women, and so why not?</p>
<p>The idea of the challenge, in case you haven&rsquo;t clicked through, is to:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Which, when you list as many categories of author as that, sounds pretty easy. And so it is.</p>
<p>So far, as you&rsquo;ll have seen from my published notes to date, I&rsquo;ve just read books by women. No trouble there. I&rsquo;m currently reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wild Seed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Octavia E Butler, which also adds African-American to the mix.</p>
<p>The only problem &ndash; and it is, let&rsquo;s face it, a very minor one &ndash; is when I see a book on my shelves that I think, &ldquo;Oh, I must read that;&rdquo; and then I think, &ldquo;but not this year.&rdquo; (Though it occurs that if I were to take &ldquo;writers with non-Christian religious or spiritual beliefs&rdquo; at face value, then I could, for example, carry on my Iain Banks re-read; but such writers &ndash; atheist writers, at least &ndash; are far from marginalised in Britain. And it wouldn&rsquo;t really be in the spirit.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making two exceptions: one is a book I started last year, about the music scene in New York in the 70s. It&rsquo;s important preparation for our trip to New York in the summer, so I intend to finish that.</p>
<p>The other is if <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robert Galbraith<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has a new book out this year. :-) And in getting that link I discover that it&rsquo;s due out in the autumn, which is pleasing to hear.</p>
<p>Apparently some people are offended by the very existence of this kind of challenge. Mostly straight white men, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to hear. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;censorship&rdquo;, apparently. I mean, what?</p>

<p>We are in Regency times, except this is not exactly the Regency of our own past; in this one, magic exists. At least in a limited form: &ldquo;Glamour&rdquo; allows people to form illusions by manipulating folds of the ether. Most people can do this to some degree, and well-brought-up young ladies are taught the art along with music and painting. But there are those who are more talented.</p>
<p>Our heroine, Jane, is one such. But as the novel opens, and for most of it, she is more concerned about the fact that, unmarried at 28, she seems destined to become (or already is) an &ldquo;old maid&rdquo;. Her prettier sister, Melody, is more likely to make a good &ldquo;match&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are, of course, balls, officers, heartbreaks, and more. If you enjoy Austen, and fantasy, you&rsquo;ll like this, I predict. It&rsquo;s the first in a series, and I look forward to reading more.</p>
<p>One thing slightly puzzled me. When Kowal was at the BSFA meeting, I recall her saying that she is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fan, and that she likes to slip a mysterious traveller into each of her books. If she slipped him into this one, she did it so subtly that I didn&rsquo;t notice it, even though I was expecting him. There is a brief appearance from the local surgeon, a Dr Smythe, so I guess that&rsquo;s him. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh yes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In fact, she says in that piece, &ldquo;if you [notice him], then I’ve done it wrong.&rdquo; So, nicely done.</p>
<p>But anyway, well worth a read, though I daresay the purist would say you should read all of Austen first (which I haven&rsquo;t; only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pride and Prejudice<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>The largest story is that of a young woman during her time at Dundee University &ndash; in fact really just a few days in one term thereat. She&rsquo;s a bit of a drip, just drifting along letting stuff happen to her &ndash; including repeatedly getting into a car with an unknown strange man who claims to be a private detective.</p>
<p>But the same time she (and I can&rsquo;t remember her name, which can be a problem with first-person characters, because how often do you use your own name?) is holding an extended conversation with her mother (who, we&rsquo;re repeatedly told, is not her mother) on a remote Scottish island whereon they are the only residents. She is trying to get her mother to tell <!-- raw HTML omitted -->her<!-- raw HTML omitted --> story. The mother is not keen to do so.</p>
<p>The slice-of-student-life in seventies Dundee is interesting enough. I&rsquo;ve never been to Dundee, but I was a student in Edinburgh in the eighties, and it doesn&rsquo;t sound all that different. Indeed, that story could be enough to carry a novel, if you had a slightly more active protagonist, and more of a plot.</p>
<p>The plot, such as it is, is in the island story. Well, the mystery is mainly told there, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it all well enough while I was reading it, but can&rsquo;t help but wonder what it&rsquo;s really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That&rsquo;s not something I would normally ask of a novel &ndash; they are their own justification, generally; they exist to tell their story, and that&rsquo;s all you need. But here, well&hellip; there isn&rsquo;t quite enough of a story. It describes itself &ndash; within the island story, of the Dundee story; that&rsquo;s part of the metaness &ndash; as a &ldquo;comic novel&rdquo;. And yes, there&rsquo;s humour in the university story, and maybe beyond. But it &rsquo;s not exactly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->funny<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you know?</p>
<p>And the last section is a detective story that the protagonist of the Dundee story is writing. But it doesn&rsquo;t really relate to either of the other stories &ndash; except maybe by some imagery &ndash; and it doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere. So I don&rsquo;t really see why it&rsquo;s there.</p>

<p>The Programmer tells us of his first record, and links it to his impending trip to see Paul McCartney. I note that, irrespective of his first single, he knows what the first album he owned was. I don&rsquo;t. I can tell you the first singles I was given (one now spoiled by the epidemic of 70s celebrities having been slimeballs), the first I bought by choice (maximally embarrassing), and various other details. But the first album? I&rsquo;m not sure. Not sure at all.</p>
<p>I can tell you the first album we owned as a family: it was called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bing and Louis<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Messrs Crosby and Armstrong. We had gone to a hi-fi shop in Glasgow to buy a stereo (which for some reason my parents pronounced &ldquo;steer-ee-oh&rdquo;, and did for years thereafter). We hadn&rsquo;t had any kind of record player before then. I must have been about seven, maybe?</p>
<p>Anyway, the guy in the shop was using this Crosby and Armstrong record<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to demo the turntable, and my Mum liked it so much that he gave it to us. As I recall it was always really badly scratched &ndash; crackly, not sticking &ndash; so it makes me wonder why on Earth he was using it to demo anything. Unless it was like, &ldquo;This system is so good you&rsquo;ll hear every crackle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that initial record, my parents mainly had soundtrack albums &ndash; or at least, those were the ones that I remember listening to. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sound of Music<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paint Your Wagon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cabaret<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip; I know, the latter was most unsuitable. Except the music isn&rsquo;t (unless you&rsquo;re overly influenced by &ldquo;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&rdquo;). It was years later before I saw the film.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>And as I think back to the cupboard under the stereo, I&rsquo;m remembering a couple of albums that were bought for me that are not the one I was going to mention (inasmuch as was going to mention early albums at all, which I wasn&rsquo;t when I started writing this).</p>
<p>There was an album of really bad versions of TV themes &ndash; mainly SF ones, I think, as the only ones I can remember are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Trek<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The former was bad, but the latter was so bad that I remember my friend Scot saying, &ldquo;The shite&rsquo;s coming out&rdquo; when it started playing one time, after I had described it as &ldquo;shite&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Why did we listen to it, then? I dunno. I guess we were musically starved to death.</p>
<p>And something from when I was a bit younger, called, if I recall correctly, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tubby the Tuba<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I don&rsquo;t even want to google that.</p>
<p>I think there was also at least one Disney soundtrack album. Maybe the animated <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robin Hood<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?</p>
<p>The thing I was thinking of, though, that was at least something like a rock or pop album, was given to me by my brother one Christmas. It was called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blockbusters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it consisted of songs by The Sweet, Mud and Suzi Quatro, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->making it a seminal influence on me, considering my origin story<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And I still have that one.</p>
<p>The connection between the three, as the well-informed musicologist will know, is that they were all <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chinnichap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> artists. Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman were the Stock, Aitken and Waterman of their day.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>It was a great album, with all the hits you could want: &ldquo;Blockbuster&rdquo; itself, of course; &ldquo;Tiger Feet&rdquo;; &ldquo;Dynamite&rdquo;; and of course, &ldquo;Devil Gate Drive&rdquo;, and more.</p>
<p>It was only years later that I realised that they weren&rsquo;t by the original artists. These were the days before compilations like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now That&rsquo;s What I Call Music!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series, which reliably package up a selection of the year&rsquo;s chart hits, properly credited and in their original single form. Back then, every year saw another album in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Top of the Pops<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series, which shared only the name with the TV show. On them you got a selection of the year&rsquo;s hits, performed by a studio band doing passable clones of the originals.</p>
<p>My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blockbusters<!-- raw HTML omitted --> album was the same kind of thing, but focused on a single songwriting team.</p>
<p>It was still good, though.</p>
<p>But none of this leads me any closer to remembering what the first album I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->chose<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to buy (or asked to have bought for me) was. Possibly it was something by The Beatles. It wasn&rsquo;t till my sister gave me a reel-to-reel tape of Beatles singles that I really got into music.</p>
<p>But I suspect the only way to be sure will be to do a careful inventory of my records. Which is project for another time.</p>
<p>By now, though, you&rsquo;re probably desperate to know about those embarrassing or spoiled early singles. Or, you&rsquo;ve completely forgotten about them.</p>
<p>Some time after we got the stereo, I was given two singles: &ldquo;The Laughing Gnome&rdquo; by David Bowie; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Leader of the Gang (I am)&rdquo; by Gary Glitter. Who&rsquo;d have thought that the second of those would come to be the more embarrassing?</p>
<p>Then a few years later, after Britain&rsquo;s Eurovision triumph, I took a liking to the Brotherhood of Man, and bought &ldquo;Oh Boy (The Mood I&rsquo;m In)&rdquo;. Which &ndash; oh my god! &ndash; was in 1977. I am ashamed.</p>
<p>I bought it in Boots (the shop, not the footwear), if I remember rightly. Remember when they were kind of a department store, and sold records?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A while ago, I read a piece called “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Improving the URL Bar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; (turns out it’s almost a year old, but never mind). I made both mental and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pinboard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-based notes of it, because my response to it was, “That’s not improving the URL bar, it’s destroying it.&quot;</p>
<p>Reading it again now, I don’t feel quite so strongly; I partly agree with what the author was getting at. But I feel we lose something important as we make URLs less visible. They show something of the hierarchy of a site, its structure — or at least that’s the origin of the path part.</p>
<p>The argument against that of course is that the path part is an implentation detail that doesn’t need to be seen by users, and perhaps more importantly, the whole thing is meaningless at best, confusing at worst to most users.</p>
<p>Well, maybe so. But to those of us who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> understand them, hiding them can be confusing, even annoying.Of course you can click in the URL bar, or press Cmd-L or Ctrl-L, to see the whole thing. More usefully, In Safari, which I’m currently using, there’s a preference called “Show full website address”, which overrides the behaviour. So you can have your choice.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But then there’s this whole thing that we have now, of browsers doing a search when you type something in URL bar; especially (though not exclusively) when it’s not obviously a URL that you’ve typed or pasted.</p>
<p>I don’t like it.</p>
<p>Or I didn’t. I’ve been using Safari since I wiped and reinstalled this Mac because it was getting really slow (successfully, I might add). I decided to keep things as stock as possible (within reason — I wasn’t going to switch back from Lightroom to iPhoto, for example, or from MailMate to Mail.app). And Firefox can sometimes be a bit of a resource hog.</p>
<p>But I spent quite some time trying to find out how to give Safari a separate search bar like FF has (or can have — it may be a plugin, but if so it’s one that I install without thinking). I had muscle memory that went Cmd-T, Cmd-K (or Ctrl-T, Ctrl-T when I’m on Windows) when I want a new tab I’m going to search in. Still have it, actually, because I still use FF on Windows on my work machine.</p>
<p>It turns out that you can’t have that on Safari. You just have to search from the URL bar. So I just got into the habit of doing that. And now I find I do it even on Firefox (you have both options there).</p>
<p>I don’t know; I still feel that the URL bar should be for URLs, and searching should be something else. but it doesn’t offend me like it used to.</p>
<p>Still, the effect is to further blur the distinction between searching for a site and going to a specific site. I see people — even experienced, technically knowledgable people — going to Google’s home page and typing “facebook.com” into the search box. I mean, what?</p>
<p>Oh, and of course if you search from Google’s home page in Chrome, your cursor jumps to the URL bar! Or it did the last time I used Chrome. Which blurs the distinction between site and browser, as well as between site and search.</p>
<p>In the end it doesn’t matter that much — people mostly get where they mean to go — but by making it less than clear what is going on when we navigate around the web, we make it harder for people to understand how it&rsquo;s all put together, and I think we lose something important in doing so.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just been listening to an interview with Lowe on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scroobius Pip&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Distraction Pieces<!-- raw HTML omitted --> podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and he comes across as very interesting and informed. And I heard about his Apple move recently on another podcast, wherein <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Myke Hurley<!-- raw HTML omitted --> talked about his move and how he had been the best introducer of new music at Radio One since Peel.</p>
<p>(Podcasts are the new rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll radio: discuss.)</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never knowingly heard his show.</p>
<p>Which is a shame, on one level. But on another &ndash; how often have I listened to Radio One since Peel died? &ndash; maybe it&rsquo;s not really my music any more.</p>
<p>Though on yet another hand, Lowe namechecks Neil Young and various other people that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted --> my music, so&hellip;</p>
<p>As to what exactly he&rsquo;s going to be doing at Apple, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no-one outside knows for sure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. &ldquo;Music curation&rdquo; seems to be the consensus, something to do with the streaming service they might be launching on the back of the Beats acquisition. The Pip podcast was recorded back in October, before he announced the move, so he doesn&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear, though, that, like Peelie, he&rsquo;s a music fan above all else.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>By that token these few years seem to be time-jump-story time. For here we have a story that, superficially at least, is very similar to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life After Life<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I wrote about last year as part of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The First Three Books of the Year<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The similarity is that we have a character who lives his life, dies, and then lives it all over again. The major differences in this case are that he remembers his previous lives; and that there are others like him.</p>
<p>Also in this one the characters &ndash; some of them, at least &ndash; question their situation, wonder about how and why it happens. They make use of their gift or curse. As such it is more a work of SF than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life After Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was.</p>
<p>Claire North, we are told at the start, is the pseudonym of a British author. Turns out it&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Catherine Webb<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, of whom I&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->written before, here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I see that I was critical then of her plotting, and the ending. The current book is much stronger in both regards.</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s not entirely satisfactory. I find it slightly annoying because &ndash; and I&rsquo;m moving into spoiler territory, so you might want to stop reading &ndash; while the people who have this affliction &ndash; members of the Cronus Club, or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kalachakra<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as they are called &ndash; do ask some questions of their situation, the only one who really tries to explore, to investigate, to understand it: he&rsquo;s the bad guy. The engine of the plot is to preserve the status quo.</p>
<p>True (within the book, and probably in reality), messing with the status quo &ndash; trying to make significant changes to the way historic events play out &ndash; tends to make a big mess of things, because history is too complex for anyone to really understand all the causes and effects and so guide it. But Vincent, the antagonist in question, is at least trying to gain some understanding. An alternative to trying to stop him might have been to work with him, but find a less destructive way to do it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, of course, that would have made for a less interesting, less fun story. And as it stands, this is both. So I can&rsquo;t really complain.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Our hero, Mae Holland, is a young woman, not long out of college, who is just starting a job at the Circle. The Circle is GooTwitBook, essentially: a massive internet company that has gobbled up all the previous incumbents (it owns 90% of search, for example) and redefined interaction on the net via its TrueYou identity technology. Real names are not just encouraged; they are required.</p>
<p>Internet trolling disappeared overnight, it seems.Unbelievable enough. Perhaps more so: no-one (almost no-one) seems to be in the least bit bothered by the reductions in privacy, the spread of The Circle into every aspect of life (putting chips in kids to prevent kidnapping; nobody complains; is kidnapping that much of a problem in the US?)</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed it, I should say, before I tear into it too much. Eggers keeps the pages turning, which is always a plus. On the other hand, it takes a long time before anything significant happens. Mae starts her job, learns the ropes, meets people, gets more and more involved in the social-networking aspects of the circle&hellip; we know things are going to take a turn for the dramatic, because the blurb tells us so (&quot;&hellip; the closer she comes to discovering a sinister truth&hellip;&quot;)</p>
<p>But it must be 200-odd pages in (of nearly 500) before we get much more than scene-setting.</p>
<p>And ultimately, while I can see how someone like Mae could be drawn further and further in after starting out with the best intentions, I find it very hard to believe that the entire rest of the world would go along with the extremities of the Circle&rsquo;s plans. It&rsquo;s set in essentially our world: where are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EFF<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? Where are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ACLU<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? Where are the voices from other countries that aren&rsquo;t keen on an American corporation&rsquo;s hegemony?</p>
<p>Where, even, are the corporations that stand up for privacy? I&rsquo;ve just got a new iPhone 6 as I write this, and I can&rsquo;t help but think that Apple&rsquo;s pro-privacy stance &ndash; their assertion that no-one can get at our data stored in iCloud &ndash; not even them, not even if there&rsquo;s a court order &ndash; is antithetical to everything that the Circle represents.</p>
<p>Which is one of the reasons why the Circle looks most like Google (it has three guys at the top, known as &ldquo;the Three Wise Men&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Of course, these criticisms might be just symptomatic of what can happen when you approach a &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo;, &ldquo;literary&rdquo; book with a science-fiction head: you question the worldbuilding, of course.</p>
<p>Ultimately it&rsquo;s a shame: the Circle the organisation is completely believable and convincing in itself. It&rsquo;s just hard to believe that it could expand in quite as unchecked a fashion as it does. And I found Mae to be partly endearing, partly annoying, which could be a realistic portrayal, and a good example of characterisation. In truth, though, she has no character. And possibly less believable than the growth of the Circle is the extent to which Mae gives herself to it, to its beliefs; even when they break her best friend, Annie, who got her the job in the first place.</p>
<p>So all in all, something of a wasted opportunity.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Not, I might add, the question of making parliament more representative (that’s actually quite an easy one, and we even had a referendum on making it a bit better in this parliament, but we voted the wrong way). Nor indeed the one triggered by the Scottish referendum. It&rsquo;s not even the most basic problem of our constitution, though I&rsquo;ll answer that in passing: write it down.</p>
<p>No, I’m speaking of the problem of the head of state. Now it seems to me to be uncontentious to say that we need to move from a hereditary system to an elected one. The existence of a hereditary element to the government of a democracy is anathema; this is plain.</p>
<p>But if you suggest this to many (perhaps still most) British citizens,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> they will speak of a great affection for the Queen; maybe for the monarchy as an institution; and for the pageantry, and how great it is for tourism. Plus they’d point to recent less-than-impressive examples of US presidents, and say something like, “I wouldn’t want President Tony Blair.&quot;
Well, I could argue against any or all of those. But there’s no need to. Here’s the thing: as soon as we want to, we could switch to having an elected head of state, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->without<!-- raw HTML omitted --> losing any of the positives there, or introducing the negatives.</p>
<p>Well, we’d have to lose the Queen; the actual, current one, Elizabeth II. But that’s no problem: there won’t be any serious talk of change in her lifetime anyway. And probably not in Charlie’s for that matter.
But at some point in the future we could have an elected head of state, and still keep the monarchy, the pageantry, and the palaces.</p>
<p>How? We just redefine the words “monarch”, “king”, and “queen”.</p>
<p>We redefine them to be the title of the elected head of state in the UK. We elect one every few years — four, six, eight, it doesn’t really matter — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and we keep everything else exactly the same<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Because of course, we’re a constitutional monarchy. The monarch has no real power, officially,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> except to ask the leader of the party with most seats at a general election to form a government.</p>
<p>The rest is window-dressing: pageantry and symbolism. The individual doing the job could as easily be one chosen by the electorate as one assigned the task by chance of birth.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Sure, such a person would be a president — a powerless president — in all but name. But I’ve come to the conclusion that the name is — to a lot of people, at least — what matters. Or at least that the concept referred to by the name <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted --> matter to many.</p>
<p>We would let the Windsors live on in reasonable splendour, in some of the Royal Palaces. We would only require one — and realistically it should probably be Buckingham Palace — to be the official residence of the new monarch. The others would still be owned by the state, of course, but the descendants of the last hereditary monarch would be allowed to live in them for a few generations at least.</p>
<p>Now, what sort of person would stand for election to a position with a fair amount of responsibility (state visits, and so on) and very little power? I don’t know, but that would work out over time. The principle works well enough in countries like Germany, where the president — yes, Germany has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a president<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; who knew? — has a similar status to that of our elected monarch — and gets to live in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->state-owned palace<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one power that the monarch does have is being the entity to whom members of the armed forces, the police, and indeed, MPs, take an oath. But even that wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. Those oaths are worded something like, &ldquo;to Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors.&rdquo; The new, elected monarch would indeed be the &ldquo;successor&rdquo; of the last hereditary one.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It turns out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not surprisingly, that this idea has been thought of before. There don’t appear to have been many examples of it, and slightly disturbingly, one of the few examples of one that’s currently in use is the Vatican. But in that case the Pope is head of state, head of government, and sole executive power; an elected dictator-for-life, in fact (and by a tiny, restricted electorate). My version would be much more limited in what they could do. And they wouldn’t think they had a direct line to anything more supernatural than the prime minister’s office.</p>
<p>When looking into the matter, I also found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this forum discussion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> wherein people keep saying things like, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a contradiction in terms: monarch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->means<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hereditary ruler&hellip;&rdquo; Do they forget that English is a changing language, always growing, expanding, shifting meanings? If we want to redefine a monarch as being an elected person, we can.</p>
<p>Oh, and hey — there’ll be nothing to stop a Windsor standing for election. You never know, they&rsquo;d probably win. But at least then they&rsquo;d have a mandate.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>And does it deserve them all? Does it live up to the effusive reaction of the community?</p>
<p>Err, well&hellip; no, not really.</p>
<p>Which is not to say it&rsquo;s bad. In a sense, nothing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could<!-- raw HTML omitted --> live up that level of praise.</p>
<p>However, my personal problem with it &ndash; at least at first &ndash; was this: I like my super-intelligent spaceship minds to be the good guys. To be part of, and defending, Utopia. In short, I want <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Culture<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And I guess I hoped that Ann Leckie might sort of take Banksie&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Obviously there wasn&rsquo;t much chance of that, and it isn&rsquo;t fair to judge the book on those terms.</p>
<p>So, back to its own terms. In any case, these super-intelligent spaceship minds aren&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->necessarily<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bad guys; but they&rsquo;re in the service of a pretty unpleasant empire. Though things get ambiguous. And interesting. And of course, there&rsquo;s the gender-blindness of the viewpoint character, which is great. So yeah, it was fun, I enjoyed it, it goes to some interesting places, and it sets things up nicely for a series.</p>
<p>Oh, god, a series. Does nobody write books in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ones<!-- raw HTML omitted --> any more? I was just looking at the current crop of so-called &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; deals on Kindle. There were quite a lot of books for crazy-cheap prices. Except&hellip; there weren&rsquo;t really that many if you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->count a series as one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon, folks, write a book that doesn&rsquo;t have a sequel, hey?</p>
<p>But I digress. Go read about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ancillary Justice<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: you&rsquo;ll find reviews of it all over the place. Then go and read it. It&rsquo;s great.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Anyway, the card had a post-it stuck inside, with some writing on it that I couldn&rsquo;t quite make out. Di wrote, &ldquo;Been trying to get this for you for ages&hellip; can you guess who it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was slow to realise that the &ldquo;who&rdquo; referred to the writing on the post-it. But she also said there was a clue on the back of the card.</p>
<p>On the back she&rsquo;d written &ldquo;devilgate.org&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The post-it looks like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And I read it to say, &ldquo;To Martin. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Suzi Quatro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a sequel to the excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->London Falling<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this suffers slightly from what feels a bit like middle-book-of-trilogy syndrome; though I believe Cornell intends this to be an ongoing series, rather than a trilogy.</p>
<p>That said, there is an overarching mystery, which we must hope will be resolved over the course of several books. And at that point, maybe he&rsquo;ll stop. But the actual story here is perhaps slight compared to the origin stories of the first one, and the horror that Quill and his wife, in particular, experienced.</p>
<p>A mysterious ghostly figure &ndash; invisible to all who don&rsquo;t have The Sight, of course &ndash; is killing people in London. There appears to be little to connect them at first, but graffiti at some of the scenes suggests there might be a link to Jack the Ripper. Has his ghost come back and this time gone after rich white men? Or is it something else entirely?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun read, despite my reservations above, with some amusing reference to fandom, and the terrible, terrible abuse of a giant of the fantasy genre.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>The background: Mike, the Programmer and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fan, if that&rsquo;s not too tautologous, was complaining about the latest episode, &ldquo;Kill the Moon&rdquo;. Now, I didn&rsquo;t think it was all that bad, as these things go, but I knew that other people, on Facebook and elsewhere, have both complained about it and praised it. Which seems to be par for the course this series (and maybe every series). Anyway, I had some thoughts on the matter, and put them like this.</p>
<p>I was disappointed that they didn&rsquo;t put in at least a handwavy explanation of the extra mass (which they could have done: posit highly-effecient energy-to-mass conversion, and the sun). But as people have said in other places, you&rsquo;re accepting a time-travelling, dimensionally-transcendental blue box, and a regenerating Time Lord, so&hellip;?</p>
<p>As to the biology of the creature&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->alien<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Possibly one of a kind. Why <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wouldn&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it lay an egg as soon as it hatched? Remembering that &ldquo;egg&rdquo; and &ldquo;hatch&rdquo; are only our Terracentrist words for something entirely other.</p>
<p>Indeed, that could be exactly why the creature&rsquo;s mass spikes in the last few years or months of its dormant cycle: it&rsquo;s forming the new &ldquo;egg&rdquo; so it itself will be ready to &ldquo;hatch&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And by default it would be in the same orbit, unless something displaced it.</p>
<p>But yes, while you can argue all that, the story would have been improved if it had included at least a nod to those points. And they should have got their sums right.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s something bigger going on across this whole series. It&rsquo;s the development of Clara&rsquo;s character, and Danny&rsquo;s secret, and everything. It&rsquo;s more: I just have a feeling that there&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->something else<!-- raw HTML omitted --> behind it all. Maybe I&rsquo;ve just been trained to expect a season arc since the Bad Wolf, but&hellip; there&rsquo;s definitely something going on.</p>
<p>And Missy and the promised land, of course.</p>
<p>Someone somewhere suggested that maybe the whole series is taking place in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->miniscope<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, since the Doc mentioned them in episode 3. I hope it&rsquo;s more than that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s all going to be so close that, whatever way the people of Scotland finally vote, they clearly are not of one mind on the matter.

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For at least a couple of years people have been asking me what I think about the Scottish independence question. At least since the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edinburgh Agreement<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I suppose. People down here in London, that is.</p>
<p>I, of course, don&rsquo;t have a vote, as I don&rsquo;t live in Scotland &ndash; indeed, I&rsquo;ve lived in London for more than half my life. But we don&rsquo;t stop being from the place we come from, and we don&rsquo;t stop caring about it; so it&rsquo;s reasonable to suppose I&rsquo;d have an opinion.</p>
<p>And I do. In fact, I have a whole range of them, at different times. Sometimes I have more than one at the same time. Which is partly why I haven&rsquo;t written about the independence referendum here before now.</p>
<p>I have been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scathing in the past<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about people who give their political opinion as &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly what I am, what I have been for the last several years: &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Back in the 70s, when there was the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->original referendum<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I would have voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; at the drop of a thistle, had I been old enough &ndash; indeed, I did, in the mock version we had at school. My reasoning in those days was purely based on emotion, and tied in to football and being the underdog.</p>
<p>In the years, the decades since then, if you had asked me whether I thought Scotland should be independent, I would probably have said yes. Most likely, most of the time. And though I stopped caring about football (and let&rsquo;s face it, Scotland stopped being anything like a force in football), it was still an emotional reaction, still about national identity, about the fact that we as a country felt overwhelmed, repressed by the relative behemoth to the south.</p>
<p>At some point, of course, I moved there. London called and I answered yes. It didn&rsquo;t change who I was, how I felt about Scotland. But it did, perhaps, give me a new way to think about how I felt about England.</p>
<p>Going back to the football/underdog business, it was always an us-and-them thing: we Scots always saw ourselves as different from, in opposition to, the English. And yet, when I met English people, they were perfectly fine &ndash; or a mixture of fine and not, of good and bad, of interesting and boring: the same as people in Scotland, or anywhere.</p>
<p>Plus, we were all British, linked by citizenship, by the NHS, by the BBC; by our shared history of literature, music, art.</p>
<p>(Though it was and remains (and always will be) annoying when people say &ldquo;England&rdquo; or &ldquo;English&rdquo; when they mean &ldquo;Britain&rdquo; or &ldquo;British&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not hard; the difference is quite clear.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s something I left out of that list of linkages above, of course. Scotland and England were joined by two unions. The Acts of Union, in which both parliaments legislated to become one parliament, is the more important one, and the one that may be overturned on the 18th of September. But before that there was the Union of the Crowns, in which Scotland very kindly agreed that England could share its monarch.</p>
<p>Now, if they were going to dissolve that one (and I had a vote) I&rsquo;d vote yes in a heartbeat &ndash; as long, of course, that separating the crowns meant Scotland moving to a democratically-elected head of state (or none; they&rsquo;re not strictly necessary).</p>
<p>Yes, I would happily be a citizen of the Republic of Scotland.</p>
<p>But that was never on the table, of course. I don&rsquo;t know whether Alex Salmond or any of the other SNP luminaries are republicans &ndash; some of them must be &ndash; but they had to keep the bluenoses on side. That&rsquo;s Rangers fans, in case you don&rsquo;t know; protestants; loyalists, unionists.</p>
<p>It must be one of the strangest states, actually: to be a Scottish person who believes in independence (and so is against the Union); but who also looks to the Scottish protestant/Rangers-supporting tradition, and is in favour of the Union of Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>Do such people exist? They must, really. Indeed, I saw a video a few months back of a Rangers fan who was so pro-Union, so anti-independence that he was wearing an England football shirt (yet he was undeniably Scottish), and saying that if the vote went yes, he&rsquo;d move to England.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an unusual reaction, that. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here we go<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. &ldquo;You can stick your independence up your arse,&rdquo; apparently.</p>
<p>But on constitutional changes: I frequently find myself frustratedly wondering, how can we be asking people to vote on such matters without this kind of thing being decided first? Shouldn&rsquo;t a new constitution have been drafted, the discussions on currency and European unions held, decisions made <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in advance<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? So that people would go to the polls knowing exactly what they were voting for or against.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that make more sense?</p>
<p>I did hear someone on the radio saying essentially that my thinking was foolish, because there are some things that can only be decided after a yes vote. But I don&rsquo;t think he really made the point.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In reading up on various things Scottish for this piece,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I discovered that part of the fallout from the seventies referendum that I linked to above was the Thatcher government. The &ldquo;40% Rule&rdquo;, which caused the referendum to fail (the majority had to comprise 40% of the electorate) was brought in by a Labour MP&rsquo;s amendment; and when it fell, according to the Wikipedia article:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That election was the one that got Thatcher elected.</p>
<p>Maybe she&rsquo;d have been elected at the next election whenever it happened; but maybe not. And I can&rsquo;t help but think that the Labour party has a disturbing sideline in betraying the people it should be serving, and this &ndash; and the current Labour party&rsquo;s staunchly pro-union stance &ndash; is an example of it. Labour should support democratic freedom and the right of small countries to govern themselves. Trouble is, so many Labour MPs are Scottish, and they can see power at Westminster slipping further and further from their grasp if they don&rsquo;t have the effect of all those Scottish seats.</p>
<p>I can understand that, though. that aspect of potential independence worries me, too: selfishly, I want to keep Scotland as part of the UK because I fear the effect of it leaving and us losing the balancing power of its more left-wing nature. Without Scotland, the rest of the UK could be doomed to near-permanent Tory governments. Or worse; UKIP along with the extremely anti-EU rump of the Tories when they split (it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will<!-- raw HTML omitted --> happen, the only questions are when, and how many MPs will go).</p>
<p>Being stuck in an RoUK that votes to leave the EU? That is distinctly unappealing</p>
<p>Just as a minor aside, something I had totally forgotten was that the 1979 referendum wasn&rsquo;t for independence: it was only to have an assembly, which sounds a lot like the Scottish Parliament of today.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I used the term &ldquo;RoUK&rdquo; above. That&rsquo;s the way people have been referring to the &ldquo;rest of the UK&rdquo;, meaning what&rsquo;s left of the UK after Scotland leaves. But I&rsquo;m not so sure that there should really be any such thing.</p>
<p>See, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland came into existence when the Republic of Ireland got its independence from Britain, leaving Northern Ireland still connected. But the &ldquo;Great Britain&rdquo; part (as a political entity, as opposed to the island): <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that came into existence with the Acts of Union<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Repeal those Acts and arguably Great Britain ceases to exist as a political entity; so how can the UK exist after that happens?</p>
<p>So rather than debating whether an independent Scotland will be able to remain in the EU will have to rejoin it from outside, we should be discussing what, exactly, will be left if Scotland leaves the union.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It disturbs me how many Scots seem to be basing their decision around personality. &ldquo;Salmond&rsquo;s a wanker&rdquo;, and all that kind of thing. If the vote goes yes, Salmond can retire (arguably the SNP will no longer have a reason to exist, in fact). But anyway, governments change, they can be voted out; people die. It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re voting to make Salmond president for life. Rather, you&rsquo;re voting for the type of country that your children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren will inherit.</p>

<p>Before I end, some other pieces that I&rsquo;ve been reading on the matter. As <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Irvine Welsh has said<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, this is a great time for political engagement in Scotland.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Billy Bragg adds<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that it might be good politically for England too.</p>
<p>And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here&rsquo;s a blog by an English guy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who favours Scottish independence. He also favours English and Welsh independence, it seems: the complete breakup of the UK; just look at his masthead. His blog has the slightly disturbing title of &ldquo;Upholding English Honour&rdquo;, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the little Englander that name might imply.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mark Millar is undecided<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but calls for better behaviour all round in the debate. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jack Deighton considers the effect that the referendum might have on Scottish literature<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the end, of course, my opinion means nothing. But here it is anyway. If I were living in Scotland, I&rsquo;m now fairly sure that I&rsquo;d be voting yes. And speaking as an attached outsider, I&rsquo;m coming round to hoping that the vote goes that way; if only to see what happens next.</p>
<p>After all, it could be the beginning of a great adventure.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Instead of the Axis forces winning the Second World War, as in Dick&rsquo;s classic, the break point is Queen Elizabeth I being assassinated, which leads to the Spanish invading England (Scotland&rsquo;s situation is never mentioned) via the Armada, and so the Catholic church becomes the dominant force in the world (at least Europe and the Americas) for centuries.</p>
<p>Most of which is told in a short prologue. The body of the novel (which a I believe is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fix-up">fix-up</a>, and certainly feels like it) consists of four short stories with some overlapping characters, which tell the tale of how rebellion against the Church comes to England.</p>
<p>I quite enjoyed it, but was put off at the start, because frankly the nuances of the workings of a traction engine running the freight across the country through a frozen winter night, were not all that interesting. In fact, it was downright boring. Would it have been less so if it were about a spaceship, instead of a traction engine? Obviously; anything is more fun with spaceships in it. But that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>In fact, the point is largely our old friend &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t automatically hold with that myself; there are plenty of examples of good stories working by &ldquo;telling.&rdquo; The problem is that if you rely entirely or mainly on telling, it&rsquo;s easy to lose either or both of the characters and the action. Certainly you can tell us what&rsquo;s happening; but it&rsquo;ll have a much stronger impact if you make us feel it.</p>
<p>The second section, for example, starts with a young man bleeding to death in the snow, and then jumps back to his training as a signaller. A much more gripping way to handle things.</p>
<p>The time period appears to be from around the sixties through to the eighties, but the Church&rsquo;s dead hand has so stifled technological progress that semaphore and steam remain the height of technology.</p>
<p>And there are fairies; old English magic that the Church hasn&rsquo;t quite managed to wipe out. But they are kind of abandoned after the second (maybe third) story.</p>
<p>Anyway, after that initial hump it was enjoyable enough, but it&rsquo;s a pleasingly slim book. If it had been the size of a modern novel, I&rsquo;m not sure it would have held my interest.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>(Is there such a thing as a &ldquo;postamble&rdquo;, I wonder?)</p>
<p>After reading the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->previous novel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I decided it was high time I caught up on some short-story reading. I had several months of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interzone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> backlogged, for example.</p>
<p>Trouble is, it seems that short stories have lost their way.</p>
<p>I know, that&rsquo;s ridiculously sweeping. Obviously any such perceived change is far more likely to be in me, than in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all recent short stories<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And yet, I feel sure that short stories <!-- raw HTML omitted -->used<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to be more interesting. So could it be an age thing? Perhaps, but let me first describe what I think it is that&rsquo;s wrong with them.</p>
<p>In short: nothing happens.</p>
<p>In slightly longer: too many of what people are presenting (and selling) as stories are in fact not really stories at all. They are little more then scenes, vignettes at best. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with such pieces of writing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per se<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, of course. They can be powerful, evocative, enjoyable&hellip; but they&rsquo;re not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stories<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it seems to me.</p>
<p>In a story, something has to happen; something or someone has to change. And too often in my recent reading, they don&rsquo;t. Or if they do, it&rsquo;s in a way or to a degree that just doesn&rsquo;t  compel, enthuse, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->excite<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I should discuss some specifics, and with the recent<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> announcement of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BSFA Awards<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, what better stories to pick than the four that were nominated? The BSFA very helpfully curates and distributes a booklet containing all the nominated fiction (also reproductions of the nominated artworks, and this year for the first time, extracts from the non-fiction nominees). Conveniently, this booklet arrived during my short-story-reading period, and I read it straight away, to give me the chance to actually vote, for a change.</p>
<p>How disappointing it was.</p>
<p>By now we know that the lead story in the booklet, &ldquo;Spin&rdquo;, by Nina Allan, won the short fiction award. So I&rsquo;ll deal with it last.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our unnamed first-person narrator hates stories of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->selkies<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and swears she&rsquo;ll never tell one. Why this might be something that she is called upon or tempted to do seems to be related to her forebears: American, her family background is Norwegian. She grew up with selkie stories. As time goes on there is the suggestion that her mother is one of the changeling creatures.</p>
<p>However, the story is good because of the characterisation. It&rsquo;s the shortest of the four, but has the strongest, most interesting characters. Well, character: our selkie-story-hating narrator. As the story starts she is working as a waitress and falling in love with a co-worker, Mona. And from there it&rsquo;s a love story with a slightly-weird background, and always the sense that something related to the selkie myths is going to happen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good review of it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on Martin Petto&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, actually. I pretty much agree with that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is an odd story about a solar-system-famous astronaut, Saga, who has had three children by three different fathers in different places. She took no part nor much interest in their upbringing; and none of them knew the others existed until they were adults.</p>
<p>Saga summons them to meet her at a station in orbit around Ceres, and something happens.</p>
<p>But not much, as I was complaining above. The telling is unusual: throughout, the children refer to themselves as &ldquo;we&rdquo;, but when they discuss their various careers, for example, they list all three of their names; none of them refers to themselves as &ldquo;I&rdquo;. In other words, it is first-person plural.</p>
<p>But this has a distancing effect; we don&rsquo;t really get to know any of the three. And a mystery happens and is not resolved, and we&rsquo;re left none the wiser as to Saga&rsquo;s motivations, or what the children will do.</p>
<p>I should just let Martin Petto do this for me, because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his take on this story<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. too, is very accurate.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Maybe I should just let <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Martin deal with this one, too<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. On the other hand, he is annoyed by it in ways that didn&rsquo;t bother me. It was, in fact, my favourite of the four, and the one I voted for first in the BSFA Awards (&ldquo;Selkie Stories are for Losers&rdquo; second, and no others).</p>
<p>Why was this the best? An intriguing, mysterious environment, an immediately-compelling narrator, a problem to solve, a world &ndash; or at least a city &ndash; to change.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;A retelling of the Arachne myth&rdquo;, we are told. It turns out that I didn&rsquo;t know the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arachne myth<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and that makes a difference.</p>
<p>We are in something like modern-day Greece &ndash; people use iPads, for example &ndash; but time is out of joint: the currency is the Drachma, and there are suggestions that ancient events actually happened within living memory. And the protagonist&rsquo;s father is a dyer, and all mentions of his trade imply that modern chemistry is all but unknown.</p>
<p>We start with the protagonist leaving the family home &ndash; running away, it feels like, though she is an adult &ndash; and making a new life for herself in another town. She gets a job, and practises her art of weaving in her spare time.</p>
<p>A mysterious old woman speaks to her enigmatically.</p>
<p>Her art soon earns her success and some recognition.</p>
<p>But some people &ndash; one woman in particular, with a  sick son &ndash; think that she has a power, that her images can influence the future, if not cause it. It emerges that her mother was executed (or murdered) because she was believed to be some kind of witch.</p>
<p>She strikes up a relationship of sorts with the sick son (who may not be very sick at all), and we think we begin to see how things are going.</p>
<p>But then the old mystery woman is back and our hero is looking at some spiders on a bush and feeling weird and it&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>What? What the hell just happened?</p>
<p>It turns out that Arachne was a weaver who claimed to be (or was) better than Athena, and got turned into a spider as a punishment. So there you are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve liked several of Nina Allan&rsquo;s stories before this, but this one just doesn&rsquo;t cut it for me; and I find it hard to believe that in all the science fiction (and fantasy) in all the world, there wasn&rsquo;t a better short story published in 2013.</p>
<p>(My namesake Petto didn&rsquo;t review this one, but instead posted a link to a review of it that no longer exists.)</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just grumpy cos on the rare occasion I&rsquo;ve get round to submitting my own stuff, it&rsquo;s been rejected.</p>
<p>Anyway, there we go. Back to novels.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I usually post before elections. This time I didn’t get round to it.</p>
<p>The results of the European parliament elections were horrendous, of course. But one slightly good thing may come out of it all.</p>
<p>IMHO the single biggest contribution to UKIP’s success is the fact that Nigel Farage was never off the BBC in the last few months. More appearances on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Question Time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than anyone else, for example. Constantly consulted on the radio about anything even vaguely connected to Europe or immigration (or anything else, it seemed).</p>
<p>In short, it’s the fact that the BBC treated them like a mainstream party that has caused — or at least helped — them to almost become one.</p>
<p>I see a close parallel with the way they give climate-change deniers equal time with climatologists whenever there’s an environment story; the intent being balance, but the effect being to give undue weight to the views of a tiny minority.</p>
<p>Here, though, they went far beyond that point, to where I feel they were guilty of violating their mandated requirement to show balance.</p>
<p>So the potential good outcome: at least people of the right can no longer say that the BBC has a left-wing, pro-Europe bias.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Anyway, the original piece follows.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has said that<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But no-one has been trying to do that.  True, there have recently been two cases in which employers have restricted what their staff can wear, with regard to items related to religions.  Now, whether employers should be able to insist on such restrictions is one question, and a valid one to be asked; but it&rsquo;s not something new, nor unique to religious clothes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not as if anyone other than British Airways has done anything to restrict the display of Christian symbols.  The woman in question there was in a uniformed occupation, and the cross violated the uniform code.  Case closed.  Do you think it would have been any different for a police officer or ambulance driver?  If you want to get the uniform rules in your job changed, speak to your employer, go through your union, or whatever: but keep the courts out of it.  Similarly if you are in a non-uniformed job with a dress code.</p>
<p>All of which is different from &ndash; almost orthogonal to &ndash; the case of Jack Straw asking Muslim women to remove their veils during a conversation (note: asking, not insisting; during a conversation, not forever).</p>
<p>I got the impression from the radio news this morning that the ArchieCant was trying to play the &ldquo;persecuted Christian&rdquo; card, railing against the overwhelming forces of our secular society.  But having scanned his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actual article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I see that that is not quite so.  Rather, he is warning of the dangers of a society which only allows state-sanctioned religions to exist.  Fair point, but again, not something that anyone is suggesting in Britain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no excuse for a Christian leader to complain about his (and it is always &ldquo;his&rdquo;) religion&rsquo;s place in modern Britain (or, even more so, America).  The various Christian churches, and the church of England in particular, hold a remarkably privileged position in British public life, from the head of state being also the head of the church, through the tax-free status of religions, right up to the exclusively-religious nature of Radio 4&rsquo;s &lsquo;Thought for the Day&rsquo; (and that&rsquo;s not even mentioning the &lsquo;Daily Worship&rsquo; or the complete takeover from 8 on Sunday mornings).</p>
<p>Then the Education Minister Alan Johnson has changed the former intent of the government regarding allowing non-believers (or different-believers) into new &ldquo;faith&rdquo; schools.  Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I am utterly opposed to &ldquo;faith&rdquo; schools: one great thing that America gets right, in my opinion, is it&rsquo;s implementation of the separation of church and state that bans states from enforcing religious observation in schools, and I would happily see it removed from schools here.  But we are where we are, and if there are going to be new, state-funded schools that base part of their teaching on a religion, then I think that the worst thing possible would be for them to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exclusively<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pupilled by kids from families who are followers of that religion.</p>
<p>And remember I went exclusively to state Catholic schools in Scotland.</p>

<p>In doing all this I got back in touch with her and with her brother, Yusuf, who I haven’t see in I don’t know how many years. So it’s all good.</p>
<p>But what about the book, I hear you ask?</p>
<p>Well, it’s not the kind of thing I’d normally choose to read — or not without a serious recommendation from a friend, for example. But it’s really, really good.</p>
<p>It’s a fictionalised autobiography, in that the protagonist goes through the same experience with contracting ME (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Myalgic Encephalopathy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) that Nasim herself did. And it’s set partly in Balloch, where we grew up.</p>
<p>Far more importantly, though, it’s a really good book. The characters are believable, especially the protagonist, Helen. That might be just as you&rsquo;d expect, as they&rsquo;re drawn from life; but I strongly suspect that it&rsquo;s no easier to write a convincing character based on a real person &ndash; even yourself &ndash; than to write one who is completely imaginary.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> We are drawn in to her inner life, her loves and her problems, and we are glad to be.</p>
<p>When she is laid low by the hateful condition, we feel her every twinge and ache. When she falls in love we fall right with her. And that&rsquo;s an important point: this isn&rsquo;t a misery memoir; it&rsquo;s by no means all about the illness, or even about Helen&rsquo;s responses to the illness. ME affects and influences everything in her life, but she still manages to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a life, and Nasim makes it an interesting one, one we&rsquo;re happy to share for a while.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time she manages to educate us about ME, through Helen&rsquo;s own learning about it. It is still a little-understood condition, with underfunded research and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mistaken guidelines from NICE<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s a fine debut, and I look forward to reading more from Nasim.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>You&rsquo;re familiar with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->origin story of the comics character Daredevil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I assume?

<p>So, back around the time I was in primary 4 or 5 (age 9-10), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Suzi Quatro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as I&rsquo;m sure you know, had a song called &lsquo;Devilgate Drive&rsquo; (or so I thought for decades; I was telling a colleague at work this story a few years back and we looked for it on Spotify, and couldn&rsquo;t find it; until we split it into two words: &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Devil Gate Drive<!-- raw HTML omitted -->'; somehow much less satisfying). I didn&rsquo;t actually know the song back then, but some of my classmates did, and started calling me &lsquo;Devilgate&rsquo;, precisely because I was decidedly non-devilish (or so I assume). I was seen as a bit of a goody-goody, because a) my Mum was a teacher, and b) I was a bit of a goody-goody.</p>
<p>As nicknames go, it was a lot better than it could have been. I remember once another kid asking me what it meant, and I said, &ldquo;Devilgate: the gate full of the devil.&rdquo; Which is kind of embarrassing, but considering how goody-goody I actually was (altar boy, and all that), it&rsquo;s surprising that I wasn&rsquo;t more bothered by the diabolical nature. Perhaps further evidence that all children are naturally without belief, until and unless they&rsquo;re indoctrinated into having some: I probably didn&rsquo;t really believe in the devil.</p>
<p>Anyway, spin forward a few years and I got online and was looking for a handle somewhere &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slashdot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> might have been where I first used it, and I was just trying to find out whether you can find the creation date of your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slashdot user ID<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it seems you can&rsquo;t. I have a vague feeling, actually, that I used it somewhere else first, but I can&rsquo;t imagine where that might be.</p>
<p>Anyway, having established it, it became my go-to handle. Wherever there&rsquo;s a web service, if there&rsquo;s a devilgate (or Devilgate: I see that I capitalised it back in the Slashdot days), it&rsquo;ll almost certainly be me. Except for eBay, where I&rsquo;m devilgate_real, because some bampot had nicked my name by the time I got there.</p>
<p>And so when I finally got round to registering my own domain, it was obvious what I&rsquo;d choose.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Gaiman&rsquo;s fantasy inspired by his own childhood experiences is fun. It is short, however, and strangely unmemorable after just a couple of months.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I read some King when I was younger, but hadn&rsquo;t in several years apart from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On Writing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, until a couple of years ago when my beloved gave me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11.22.63<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, his time-travel fantasy about going back to save JFK. I throughly enjoyed that, and was reminded that he had a vast back-catalogue that I could catch up on.</p>
<p>A significant portion of that catalogue is contained in the single volume of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is a monolith, a vast behemoth of a book, at around 1300 pages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, though, and I shouldn&rsquo;t fixate on its size. King uses the space to let his characters breathe and grow. They have the strange limitation as adults that they have almost totally forgotten their childhoods, as a direct result of their encounter with the titular creature. Though not, as you might suppose, because they were traumatised. Rather it seems to be a feature of interacting with the supernatural entity that haunts the town of Derry, Maine, in the primary guise of a scary clown, that, if you face it and live (few do) you forget the encounter.</p>
<p>I had met Derry before: in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11.22.63<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the protagonist spends some time in this strange town, and the effect in the book was so jarring &ndash; it felt obvious that here was a place with a history &ndash; that I looked it up. Turns out he&rsquo;s used the fictional town as the setting for several stories (and presumably couldn&rsquo;t resist routing his time-traveller through it).</p>
<p>Anyway, getting back to the book at hand: I spent weeks embroiled in King&rsquo;s small-town America, its characters and its horrors. And I thoroughly enjoyed it, but am in no hurry to go back there soon.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Wow. Just wow. This is an awesome book. Atkinson manages to tell the same woman&rsquo;s life story again and again and keep it interesting and gripping every time (well, there&rsquo;s a slight <!-- raw HTML omitted -->longueur<!-- raw HTML omitted --> during a German period in one iteration, but the undercurrent of terror &ndash; she is living in the Führer&rsquo;s holiday home &ndash; keeps it from being a problem).</p>
<p>As you probably know, it&rsquo;s the tale of a woman who was born in 1910 and died &ndash; at various times, and in various ways. We are told the story of her life as she repeats it, again and again &ndash; or through multiple parallel timestreams. As the iterations go on, she starts to have some awareness of her past lives. She doesn&rsquo;t understand what they are at first, of course, especially as a child. At first she&rsquo;ll just have a sense of dread as she nears an event that killed her before. Later they are clearer memories of the future.</p>
<p>It is utterly fascinating and a joy. And not SF, though if I had read it soon enough I&rsquo;d have nominated it for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BSFA Award<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I read Kate Atkinson&rsquo;s first, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Behind the Scenes at the Museum<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, years ago, and likened it to Iain Banks&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Crow Road<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (hard to to think of higher praise). I read one other, but wasn&rsquo;t so impressed, and rather lost track of her, apart from watching the TV adaptations of her detective stories. I think maybe I need to go back and catch up on her work.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one slightly positive thing about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Philip Chevron dying two days ago<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for me, it&rsquo;s that I was reminded that the box set <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just Look Them Straight In The Eye And Say&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pogue Mahone!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> exists; and also that it is now available in an inexpensive format for about £14. I ordered it on Tuesday night, and it arrived today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to it all afternoon. It&rsquo;s a combination of outtakes, demos, live tracks and radio sessions, and it&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>One thing that stands out at the moment, though, is that their music is steeped in the imagery of death. &ldquo;Some people left for heaven without warning&rdquo; is a line from “Sally Maclennane”, of course.</p>

<p>A while back I heard the strangest ever request from a customer.</p>
<p>As you might know, I work for a software house.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> We write financial software for banks. As a thing to talk about it tends to be boring, but it can have interesting challenges.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of our product&rsquo;s problems, as a web-based app, is that it was written to specifically target the Internet Explorer browser.</p>
<p>I know that seems at best charmingly retro, and at worst appallingly non-standards-compliant, but there are a couple of good-ish reasons. Principally the fact that the original version of the web app was written by contractors who both only knew IE, and were told that our clients only cared about IE. The latter was probably true at the time, and as for the former, well: let&rsquo;s just say that sometimes people in companies make some stupid decisions, and leave it at that.</p>
<p>Inevitably, and especially as the browser landscape has matured and Apple and Google have come to rule the world, there have been calls to fix things. But there have always been higher-priorities. Getting new features done takes priority over making things work better, sadly.</p>
<p>One of these years we&rsquo;ll fix it &ndash; personally I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be as difficult as people always think (that fear is another reason why we have resisted doing it).</p>
<p>But what it would really take to force us to sort it out would be if a client demanded it.</p>
<p>If it were going to make or break a sale, we&rsquo;d be all hands on deck.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting that we got a query a while back wherein a client was concerned about the fact that the app doesn&rsquo;t work properly in Firefox. This was causing some of their users distress, as FF is their chosen browser. Was this it? Was this the opportunity, at last, driven by customer demand, to bring our app into the late twentieth century?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, the client had a better idea. They wanted us to to change our app such that it would detect that the user was running something other than IE&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; and prompt them to use IE instead.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>(We didn&rsquo;t agree to their request.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Anyway, a couple of things. I noticed that I have a few posts sitting in draft form but that are more-or-less complete, so you may shortly see some slightly-non-timely things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking I might have another go at blogging about the books I read. I appear not to have done that regularly since 2009 (these years go by so fast&hellip;) I might not give every book its own post, but put a few into a summary. As I&rsquo;ve only read three so far this year (one of them was Stephen King&rsquo;s 1300-page behemoth <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so I don&rsquo;t feel too bad about the count) I&rsquo;ll start with those.</p>
<p>This might just encourage me to post regularly, if not frequently.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here&rsquo;s a picture of Arthur&rsquo;s Seat to keep things visual.</p>

<p>The books in the attic aren&rsquo;t terribly well ordered, since they&rsquo;re just in boxes, and have been moved in and out of them over the years. Also it&rsquo;s very dusty up there. Not that that affects the order or accessibility of the books; I just say it to try to evoke some sympathy. Poor, poor, pitiful me, sneezing in old clothes while looking through lots and lots of lovely books.</p>
<p>I digress. Sometimes I think its what I do best, actually. One of the non-Banksie things I found was the box containing my copies of <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marvel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Miracleman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I hadn&rsquo;t read for a long, long while. To my shock, an issue was missing. Luckily it was an early one (4, I think), and I also found my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Warrior<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s, where it was originally published, so I had all the material. I still prefer it in black &amp; white with the bigger pages, incidentally.</p>
<p>On a theme that will become common, I was surprised at how much I didn&rsquo;t remember. The whole &ldquo;Olympus&rdquo; thing, for example. I thought that was just a passing page or two at the end, but it&rsquo;s actually woven through the second half of the work. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t remember much after the part that was in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Warrior<!-- raw HTML omitted --> apart from Johnny Bates&rsquo;s carnage in London.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s still pretty good, but not as good as I remembered. It doesn&rsquo;t hold up the way <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Watchmen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> still does, in my opinion. Also Thatcher appears in it briefly, which is just weird.</p>
<p>To return to my digression, I found various things in the attic that I haven&rsquo;t read in a long time, so there will doubtless be more rereading ahead. Which is kind of a shame, because as always there are so many new (and old but unread) books to read.</p>
<p>But back to Banksie. I thought of just starting at the beginning and working through them all in order of publication. But I found I didn&rsquo;t really feel like reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wasp Factory<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at the time, while I did feel like reading some of the SF. So I started with the Culture novels. I thoroughly enjoyed all that I&rsquo;ve got through so far, and had the mostly-pleasant (but slightly worrying) sense of not being totally familiar with them.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Consider Phlebas<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I still find it striking that here in the first Culture novel, if you don&rsquo;t have any prompting about the Culture, it&rsquo;s not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->totally<!-- raw HTML omitted --> obvious that they&rsquo;re the good guys. Horza is so well-written, so sympathetic as a viewpoint character, that it&rsquo;s hard not to support his anti-Culture beliefs. That those beliefs are not really examined (in the time period of the novel, at least) is probably a realistic picture of how most of us go through most of our lives.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Player of Games<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I had remembered this as one I hadn&rsquo;t liked so much, with its gloomy, spoiled protagonist. Gurgeh is both of those things, but he is also manipulated quite thoroughly by Special Circumstances<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and in the end his life is improved because of it. Which wasn&rsquo;t their intention (probably); or not their main one, at least. But it does tell us that no matter how good your life is in the Culture, it can still get better. Damn.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Use of Weapons<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->: There&rsquo;s a game you can play when you&rsquo;re reading most Culture novels: it is, &ldquo;What Are Special Circumstances Trying to Achieve This Time?&rdquo; This is the book with the largest number of distinct chances to play, as we work backwards through Zakalwe&rsquo;s timeline. A series of grim fragments of conflicts on different worlds, with Zakalwe always there as some kind of general or military advisor. We see him at the end of his engagement each time, and usually at the end of his tether if not the end of a rope.</p>
<p>And the forward-running chapters also have an unresolved special circumstance. But we don&rsquo;t really care about it, or any of the others. We care about Zakalwe. And about Sma, and the wonderfully-named drone, Skaffen-Amtiskaw; but mainly about Zakalwe. Which is impressive work by Banksie, considering.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note: contains spoilers<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Early on &ndash; maybe it was still spring &ndash; when we booked our holiday to Greece, I decided it was time to reread <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Magus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I read it something like thirty years ago, when I was at university. I remember enjoying it, but being annoyed by the ending.</p>
<p>So I was expecting that annoyance to still be there. On occasions between then and this rereading, I have looked at the last couple of pages. I did so again before starting it this time; it was no clearer for doing so. Fowles himself recognised problems with the ending. In his foreword to the revised edition, he acknowledges that the novel has flaws, not least that it is a novel of adolescence, both his and that of his protagonist. (I found Nicholas to be annoyingly adolescent and spoilt, especially at the start, on this reading.) He goes on to say:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(Ellipsis the author&rsquo;s, incidentally.) The thing is, he hasn&rsquo;t done so. Not really. Not if you want to know whether or not Nicholas and Alison get back together, which seems to have been what his correspondents regarding the original edition were concerned about.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what bothered me, either then or now. I don&rsquo;t mind an ambiguous ending. And I actually kind of like the way you can think of it as a freeze-frame, like the ending of a film (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bonnie and Clyde<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ends like that, if I remember correctly &ndash; though in a more dramatic event).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>No, what annoys me is that we never really learn what Conchis and the others were up to. They called their project &ldquo;The Godgame&rdquo; (it was also Fowles&rsquo;s proposed title for the novel at one point); but what was the point of it? What were they trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Ultimately I suppose that can be answered in part by Fowles&rsquo;s argument regarding people asking about the &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of the novel:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So the Godgame&rsquo;s meaning or purpose may be simply the reaction it provokes in Nicholas; but that still leaves us wondering, as I said above, why did Conchis do it? Was it just the whim of a rich man? He did it because he could? And yet mere whim feels weak alongside all the discussion of freedom and what it means.</p>
<p>In the end the mild sense of frustration remains, because we never find that out.</p>
<p>Back when I first read it, there was no immediately obvious way to find discussions of it. No doubt there were some in academic journals and theses, but finding those would have been difficult. Now, of course, such discussions are easy to find. And the most interesting one I found recently was by Jo Walton on Tor.com: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twists of the Godgame: John Fowles&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Magus<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As Walton says, the ending &ldquo;twists at just the wrong moment and sends it away from metaphysics into triviality and romance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She goes on to compare it to Ted Chiang’s “The Story of Your Life”, which I haven&rsquo;t read. But the argument that &ldquo;Fowles doesn’t know what he’s doing, that the underlying reality that is never explained doesn’t make sense&rdquo; rings true for me. And so when she says that &ldquo;what Chiang’s &lsquo;The Story of Your Life&rsquo; does is what Fowles may have wanted to do&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m inclined to suspect that she&rsquo;ll be proved right when I come to read the Chiang.</p>
<p>I still loved the book, though: you can enjoy the journey even if you&rsquo;re not entirely happy with the destination. Walton&rsquo;s conclusion gives a hilarious suggestion for how it could have been improved, though:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now that would have been an ending.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I was surprised that it was so sparsely attended. There were only about thirty people there, including all the ones who were presenting papers. Given Banksie&rsquo;s popularity, I thought it would be packed. A few years back when he was guest at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BSFA<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s monthly London meeting, they had to have it in a lecture hall at Imperial College, instead of the usual room over or under a pub.  I suppose that either the academic nature of it put people off, or just that it wasn&rsquo;t very well publicised. Shame, really.</p>
<p>My assessment of the event generally is much the same as Paul&rsquo;s so you can just read his comments.  But of the papers that were presented, the one that I was most disappointed by was the one that I would probably have found most interesting, if I had been able to hear it. Martyn Colebrook&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Playing Games with Gods: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Player of Games<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;, which compared the Banks work with John Fowles&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Magus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. By coincidence I&rsquo;ve read both of those in the last couple of months (and more on them later), so it would have been interesting to hear what Dr Colebrook had to say.  But unfortunately he was just speaking too quietly for the human ear, which is what I&rsquo;m equipped with (I was at the back of the room, having arrived late).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sought his paper online, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be around yet.  Maybe sometime.</p>
<p>The most used word of the day, apart from &ldquo;Culture&rdquo;, was &ldquo;transgressive&rdquo;. Indeed, the same Dr Colebrook has edited a collection of essays called <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Transgressive Iain Banks<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s my turn.  I didn&rsquo;t know him personally at all, despite having friends who did.  Of course I would echo all the comments to the effect that he was a friendly and entertaining speaker, having seen him at several conventions and readings.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the books, man, the books.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not totally sure when I first heard of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wasp Factory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I&rsquo;d be willing to bet it was from my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Andrew<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I think I remember him mentioning it, but maybe I had heard of it already.  Either way, sometime around 86 or 87, I&rsquo;d say, I started reading his books.  I know that the first three at least were already out (and in paperback).  Maybe <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Consider Phlebas<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, too. And I loved them, especially <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bridge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Espedair Street<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It was clear &ndash; even before he started publishing explicit science fiction with the added initial &ndash; that he was one of us.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bridge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s fantasy sequences, and those of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Walking on Glass<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, can be read as the products of damaged minds; but they&rsquo;re better if you read them as at being about what&rsquo;s really happening to their protagonists.</p>
<p>The first three SF novels are fine and dandy, but it wasn&rsquo;t them that really changed me.  Changed me, that is, into a buyer of hardback books &ndash; and an on-release buyer of Banksie.  But it was at a science-fiction convention that it happened.  And all it took was a friend&rsquo;s recommendation, and a single line.</p>
<p>It must have been 1992, so the convention would have been Illumination, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eastercon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Blackpool.  Though it could have been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Novacon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that year.  Either way, I had seen the new one by Banksie in the book room, but decided to wait for the paperback, as was my wont in those days.  Hardbacks seemed incredibly expensive, at maybe fifteen or sixteen pounds.</p>
<p>Luckily I prevaricated to my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Steve<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  He said, &ldquo;You should buy it, Martin.&rdquo;  I resisted still.  He said, &ldquo;Just read the first line and you&rsquo;ll buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did. It was, &ldquo;It was the day my grandmother exploded.&rdquo;  I bought <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Crow Road<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instantly, and have bought every subsequent Banksie in hardback on release.  Except for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Raw Spirit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which came out just before Christmas (and surprised me by appearing in WH Smith&rsquo;s when I hadn&rsquo;t even heard it existed).  I didn&rsquo;t buy it right away, but received it a few days later as a perfectly-targeted Secret Santa present from a work colleague.</p>
<p>So I just want to thank those friends, and thank Iain&rsquo;s memory for a great, great body of work.  I can&rsquo;t express how sad I am that we won&rsquo;t hear from him again.</p>
<p>Oh, and calling him &ldquo;Banksie&rdquo;?  That has always been the way in the SF community, and he used it himself.  Always with the &ldquo;ie&rdquo;; that guy with &ldquo;y&rdquo; ending is just some blow-in.  I&rsquo;m sure it comes from having been &ldquo;Banks, I&rdquo; at school; just as Daniel Weir of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Espedair Street<!-- raw HTML omitted --> got his nickname &ldquo;Weird&rdquo; from being &ldquo;Weir, D&rdquo;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s a recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article in the Guardian by Sarah Churchwell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about how wonderful it all is. It&rsquo;s a well-written piece, but I find it just as hard to get to grips with, to understand the point of, as the novel itself.</p>
<p>So I did a search for &ldquo;Gatsby overrated&rdquo;, and found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this piece by Kathryn Schulz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which absolutely nails it.</p>
<p>One point she makes perhaps helps to explain why I find the characters so objectionable:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My favourite part is her parenthetical assertion that:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Though I had to look up <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edward St. Aubyn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But her main argument concerns the shallowness of the characterisations, the emphasis on symbolism over emotion:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What was Fitzgerald doing instead of figuring out such things about his characters? Precision-engineering his plot, chiefly, and putting in overtime at the symbol factory.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For me, though, as I think on it some more, the problem with it all (and in contradiction to the last quote above) is the thinness of the plot. The prose is famously poetic in places, and that&rsquo;s fine; but the real weakness is that there&rsquo;s almost no story there.</p>
<p>And that famous last line<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>?  Poetic though it is, when you parse it, it means absolutely nothing at all.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>But somehow I could never totally see the point.  Flickr I understood: it&rsquo;s a site to store your photos.  If you don&rsquo;t have, or don&rsquo;t want the bother of managing, your own web space, you can put your pictures there and show them to other people.  And it&rsquo;s got the social thing going on, too, with the ability to follow people and all that.  It feels a bit bolted on, but it does no harm.  And when I discover a site like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->500px<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as I did a few weeks ago, well, that&rsquo;s obvious: a place to store your pictures and to find other people&rsquo;s.  Not for nothing is their tag line, &ldquo;The best photos on the web&rdquo; (or it was: today it says, &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s best photo sharing&rdquo;, which is similar, but different).  I just wish they&rsquo;d learn how to keep me signed in.</p>
<p>But Instagram didn&rsquo;t really grab me.  And today they nearly ejected me.</p>
<p>Oddly for a net-based thing, I heard about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the new terms of service<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the radio.  The story was that the terms were going to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->allow them to sell their users' pictures for advertising<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, without paying, asking, or even telling the users.</p>
<p>I tweeted:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So for now I haven&rsquo;t deleted my account, and we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>I found out about the change from the radio, and the correction by requesting a deletion; my inbox remains unsullied.  How about a wee email, Instagram?  You&rsquo;ve got my address.</p>

<p>Which proved to be just as well, because after just a couple of days on the new novel, I was cycling home from work one day when a short story deposited itself in my head, unbidden, but complete.  I took a few days off from the novel to work on that, thus further ensuring my rebellious state.</p>
<p>As an experiment for my own interest, I also tried to keep a note of how many words I wrote for other things, both at home and at work; just to get an idea of how many words I write normally.  I kept that all in a Google Docs spreadsheet, so I could get to it wherever I was.  I&rsquo;m sure I wasn&rsquo;t complete in recording everything, though.</p>
<p>In the end I wrote 16,600 words of fiction;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> so comparable with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last year<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  And oh, dear: reading over those old posts to get links makes me realise that this is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->third<!-- raw HTML omitted --> NaNo during which I&rsquo;ve been working on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Accidental Upgrade<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But having said that, the thing that I&rsquo;m underplaying in all this is that: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I. Finished.  My. Novel.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  89,000 words of first draft, done and… well, left quite dusty, truth be told.</p>
<p>And a new short story drafted, and another novel reasonably well under way.  I&rsquo;m feeling quite positive about it all.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I finally have a dSLR.  No longer do I have to hold my camera up in front of me in that quite silly-looking way; once again I can look through a viewfinder.  Hurrah!</p>
<p>I say “once again” because I used to have — well, still do have, but almost never use — a film SLR, namely an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_OM-1">Olympus OM-1</a>.</p>
<p>With the new one I’ve gone over to Canon, though.  It’s an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_600D">EOS 600D</a>; which rather oddly is known in America as the Rebel T3i and in Japan as the Kiss X5</p>
<p>Here’s a picture of Clapton Pond to show you what it can do.  Click through for a better view on Flickr.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I bought it online for full £200 less than I’d&rsquo;ve had to pay at <a href="http://www.jessops.com">Jessops</a>; and by going to a site called <a href="http://www.digitalrev.com/">DigitalRev</a> I saved about £100 over Amazon’s prices.  DigitalRev’s service was incredibly good: my camera arrived in London from Hong Kong in two days.  It took a few more days for DHL to get it to me, but that’s not DigitalRev’s fault.  Really astonishingly fast service, and for the cheapest price I could find anywhere.</p>
<p>The only slightly annoying thing is that I clicked a link in their email asking for comments (essentially to say the above); it took me to a site called <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com/">Reseller Ratings</a>, where I filled in a few boxes, and then hit “Submit”… whereupon it wanted me to create a profile before I could submit the review.  And I just couldn’t face it.  I’ll almost certainly never go to that site again, so even though it’s only a name and email (and password) I just thought, “No.  I’d rather put a good review up on my own site.”</p>
<p>So think on that, people running review sites.</p>

<p>But the question is, what generation?</p>
<p>The tacit assumption was always that the slogan applied to the <em>next</em> generation: to teenagers and younger kids.  Get them up off their arses, it implied, and away from their consoles, and down to their local sports hall, playing field, or pool.</p>
<p>Whether and to what extent that has worked will take a long time to see.  But there&rsquo;s another generation that is already visibly inspired, to my admittedly limited view.</p>
<p>Mine.</p>
<p>Where by &ldquo;mine&rdquo; I sort of mean &ldquo;everyone who&rsquo;s not still a child.&rdquo;  Because what I&rsquo;m seeing as I cycle to and from work these days is that the streets are <em>packed</em> with cyclists.  And people out running, too; there are definitely more than usual.  But it&rsquo;s us London cyclists who are really showing up.</p>
<p>I personally have taken public transport to work only once since before the Olympics started,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and I&rsquo;ve been pushing myself to get that bit faster on my bike rides.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of it as something like, &ldquo;Hoy!  It&rsquo;s the Pendleton-Trott-Kenny-Wiggins effect.&rdquo;  But that&rsquo;s a bit unwieldy, and misses some names out.</p>
<p>It is clear to me, though, that the &ldquo;generation&rdquo; that is in their twenties, thirties and yes, forties &ndash; and probably older &ndash; are out there in bigger numbers than ever before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see how it holds up as autumn and winter come in, of course.  But vastly increased cycling in London?  That would really be a worthwhile legacy.</p>

<p>Back in 2004, 2005 or so, when London was bidding to host the Olympics, I was against it.  My concerns were the cost, the crowding, and the general disruption of it all.  I was, I admit, cynical.  I recall being annoyed by the fact that the people running the bid published a number to which you could text &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, to say you supported the bid; but there was no option to text &ldquo;no&rdquo; to say you opposed it.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking back to what I wrote at the time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I see that my biggest concern was the effect on the Lower Lee Valley.  It turned out that the removal of wilderness didn&rsquo;t stretch as far as my fears suggested; and of course much of the land that has been used was polluted, abandoned, brownfield industrial sites.  Bob Stanley of St Etienne (the band) has an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting piece in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> about that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But then London won the bid, and I though, &ldquo;OK, fine, it&rsquo;ll be interesting at least.&rdquo;  I had enjoyed watching the previous ones, and there was the regeneration for East London that looked promising.  And the fact that it would just be down the road for me added to the interest.  After all, that would make it easier to get tickets, right?  Obviously there would specific tickets made available to to locals.</p>
<p>Hindsight even makes me wonder whether the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->events of the very next day<!-- raw HTML omitted --> didn&rsquo;t make me more supportive: blitz spirit, don&rsquo;t let the bastards grind you down, &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->soft power<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;, and all that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the years since then I&rsquo;ve gone through various thoughts about the whole thing.  Obviously there were the concerns about how long we would be paying for it all.  And more recently there were the worries about the security preparations and the expected madness of the precautions.  Of course more recently we&rsquo;ve had the G4S fiasco, and the drafting in of extra soldiers.</p>
<p>More bizarrely we&rsquo;ve seen the growth of the Olympic &ldquo;brand police&rdquo;, the forbidding of certain words and combinations of words (including, ridiculously, things like &ldquo;summer&rdquo;, &ldquo;bronze&rdquo;, and &ldquo;2012&rdquo;).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But closer to home one of the things that has annoyed me is the way they&rsquo;ve treated our towpath.</p>
<p>The main stadium sits between two branches of the River Lee (or Lea): the river itself, and the Lee Navigation or Cut, which is essentially a canal constructed as a tributary<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of the main river.  The towpath of the Navigation is a popular cycling and walking route for us local types.  As we watched the construction site form and the massive buildings grow (and in my case <!-- raw HTML omitted -->moaned about the ugly fencing round it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), we were able to keep a close eye on it all by going along the towpath.  And indeed, a minor, but pleasing, instance of regeneration has been the resurfacing of the towpath, making it much more pleasant to cycle on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Above all, it seemed obvious that we would use the towpath to actually get to the Olympic Park.  How else?</p>
<p>Until a few months ago when it became clear that the towpath was going to be closed for the duration of the games.  The reason given &ndash; of course &ndash; was &ldquo;security&rdquo;.  But what exactly is the security risk of providing  access via the towpath?</p>
<p>In all honesty, I had my doubts about its use during the games; but I wasn&rsquo;t concerned about terrorism.  Rather I feared for people&rsquo;s safety.  It&rsquo;s a towpath, after all: relatively narrow, unfenced, and unlit.  And, critically, next to a polluted canal.  If thousands &ndash; or even only hundreds &ndash; of people were trying to leave the park that way all at once &ndash; after the opening ceremony, say &ndash; then I could see that it would be problematic.</p>
<p>So I begin to wonder whether the &ldquo;security&rdquo; excuse was brought out to hide the more mundane, but always-criticised-by-the-tabloids truth: health and safety.</p>
<p>Then we heard that bikes would be among the banned items in the park; but also that there would be cycle parking: it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sounded<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like mixed messages, but we would have to wait and see.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ah, the joys of Olympic ticketing.  Even as I write, on the third full day of the Games, they don&rsquo;t seem to have really sorted it all out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a massively complex task, to allocate and sell tickets for hundreds of events over dozens of venues, all taking place in such a concentrated time period.  But it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;ve never done it before; it&rsquo;s not even like they haven&rsquo;t done it in the Internet Age.  It should largely be a solved problem, it seems to me.</p>
<p>We had decided to treat the Olympics as our family holiday: we would take a couple of weeks off, buy a load of tickets, and that would be our main summer break.  After all, it would be just down the road, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, etc.  So we signed up for the ballot, spent time listing events we might like to see, and so on.  When the time came we hit the website and listed a summer holiday&rsquo;s worth of tickets (hampered slightly by me having a MasterCard, which of course is the black sheep of Olympic ticket-buying).</p>
<p>In the end my beloved was allocated tickets to three events, and I got none (had they detected that invalid-card possession?)</p>
<p>However, that was just the initial ballot; and because I had been unsuccessful there, I was entitled to try to buy tickets in the conventional way in the second round.</p>
<p>On the day I woke up early and grabbed my laptop.  The site, inevitably, crumpled.  I went back to sleep for a bit.  Tried again later.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall how long it took, but in the end I managed to get a further three events.</p>
<p>And that was that.  Remember when I said up there, &ldquo;it would just be down the road … that would make it easier to get tickets&rdquo;?  Yeah.  Somehow that didn&rsquo;t happen.  The Olympics is clearly not meant for the people who live near it.  Or not particularly.  I&rsquo;m not suggesting it should be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for locals; but how hard would it have been to allocate a percentage of tickets to residents of host boroughs &ndash; or the whole of London &ndash; in a first pass?  If they didn&rsquo;t get bought they would be offered on, of course.  The answer is &ldquo;not very&rdquo;; the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hackney Weekend<!-- raw HTML omitted --> festival did exactly that, after all.  Glastonbury gives free tickets to residents of the nearby village, I seem to recall.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s where we are.  We later added a Paralympic athletics day, which will finally get us into the main stadium; and a set of Olympic Park passes, so we can go and have a wander round and soak up the atmosphere on Wednesday.  But as I write there are still tickets available, even for swimming, even for the main stadium.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re made of money, at least.  Hell, you can still go to the closing ceremony if you&rsquo;ve got £995 or £1500 to spare.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But I don&rsquo;t mean to turn all negative.  I&rsquo;m actually really excited about it all, and thoroughly enjoying everything I&rsquo;ve seen on telly; especially, of course, Danny Boyle&rsquo;s masterpiece of an opening ceremony.  Much has been said about that elsewhere, so I won&rsquo;t say a lot.  Just that it was far better, and a far truer representation of Britain than we could have imagined, or even hoped for.  Part of the fun was following along on Twitter, of course (when it wasn&rsquo;t too distracting to do so).  And my favourite comment of all was one that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mitch Benn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> retweeted from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simon Evans<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So true.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been enjoying seeing the first few days worth of events on telly.  Some thoughts:</p>

<p>I should write about legacy (and sustainability<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>), but I&rsquo;ve gone on long enough, and anyway, it&rsquo;s another whole discussion.  But I cycled down that way on Saturday; along the part of the towpath that&rsquo;s still open, across Hackney Marshes (by a new, temporary path) and to the bridge across the river where there is access via Eton Manor Gate.  There is a vast cycle park there, and from the gate it&rsquo;s only supposed to be a few minutes walk to, for example, the Basketball Arena.  So it&rsquo;s all good.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>We visit the park on Wednesday, and start seeing actual events from Friday.  I may report back.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

		<a href="https://devilgate.org/2012/07/02/tip-using-pandoc-to-create/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2012-07-02 23:25:55 &#43;0000">Jul 2, 2012</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If you’re using the excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pandoc<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to convert between different document formats, and you:</p>
<ul>
<li>want your final output to be in HTML;</li>
<li>want the HTML to be styled with CSS;</li>
<li>and want the HTML document to be truly standalone;</li>
</ul>
<p>then read on.</p>
<p>The most common approach with Pandoc is, I think, to write in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Markdown<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and then convert the output to RTF, PDF or HTML. There are all sorts of more advanced options too; but here we are only concerned with HTML.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pandoc<!-- raw HTML omitted --> command has an option which allows you to style the resulting HTML with CSS. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Example 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the User’s Guide shows how you do this, with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-c<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option. The example also uses the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option, which means that we are creating a standalone HTML document, as distinct from a fragment that is to be embedded in another document. The full command is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">pandoc -s -S --toc -c pandoc.css -A footer.html README -o example3.html
</code></pre></div><p>If you inspect the generated HTML file after running this, you will see it contains a line like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">link</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rel</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;stylesheet&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;pandoc.css&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;text/css&#34;</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>That links to the CSS stylesheet, keeping the formatting information separate from the content. Very good practice if you’re publishing a document on the web.</p>
<p>But what about that “standalone” idea that you expressed with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option? What that does is make sure that the HTML is a complete document, beginning with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DOCTYPE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag, an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;html&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag, and so on. But if, for example, you have to email the document you just created, or upload it to your company’s document store, then things fall apart. When your reader opens it, they’ll see what you wrote, all right; but it won’t be styled the way you wanted it. Because that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pandoc.css<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file with the styling is back on your machine, in the same directory as the original Markdown file.</p>
<p>What you really want is to use embedded CSS; you want the content of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pandoc.css<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to be included along with the prose you wrote in your HTML file.</p>
<p>Luckily HTML supports that, and Pandoc provides a way to make it all happen: the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-H<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option, or using its long form, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash;include-in-header=FILE<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>First you’ll have to make sure that your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pandoc.css<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> starts and ends with HTML <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;style&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags, so it should look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">style</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;text/css&#34;</span>&gt;

<p>The Radio 1 Hackney Weekend festival was fabulously well organised, loads of fun, and passed off with only three arrests.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Booking the tickets a month or two ago had turned out to be easy (we sat with multiple browsers and phones as the SeeTickets site crumpled, but in fact it was no trouble at all after we left it for a while). Being local residents helped, as half the tickets were for Hackney households.</p>
<p>It was a free show, so there were restrictions; most notably that you could only book for one of the two days, and only two tickets per person. We were doing it for the kids; and the kids in this family (to say nothing of most of their friends) favoured the Sunday lineup; so that&rsquo;s the one we went for.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The lineup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> leaned heavily to the various dance subgenres: (modern) R&amp;B, dubstep, and so on. Not forgetting hip-hop, of course; not only did Jay-Z headline the first night, he guested with Rihanna on the second.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For me the highlight of the day was Jessie J; though I was mildly disappointed that she censored herself in my favourite of her songs, &lsquo;Do it Like a Dude&rsquo;.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Tinie Tempah was also good, though since I&rsquo;ve subsequently been listening to Enter Shikari, I&rsquo;m slightly disappointed to have missed them as they clashed with Tinie.</p>
<p>There was great secrecy and much speculation over who the &ldquo;Special Guest&rdquo; was to be. They managed to keep it hidden until the day, which, while impressive in its way, had me worried. I thought that, depending on who it was, there could be a disaster. In particular, if it had been Justin Bieber, as some kids were speculating, there would have been a vast, simultaneous, two-way flow, from and to the stage (my kids would have been running away from the stage; there are no Beliebers at Devilgate Towers).</p>
<p>Not long before the guest&rsquo;s time I heard on good authority that it was going to be Beyoncé. Believable, as her hubbie was there, and she was said to be &ldquo;in the house&rdquo;. But I doubted it: isn&rsquo;t she a bigger name than Rihanna? And anyway, I get the sense that she&rsquo;d be too much of a diva to go on second on the bill.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the end it was Dizzee Rascal, which with hindsight made total sense, what with him being a local boy and all.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As we wandered through the stages and the day, we heard snatches of Rihanna&rsquo;s &lsquo;We Found Love&rsquo; seven times (I started keeping count at the third) from various between-act DJs and stalls. So by the time it closed the night, I was thoroughly ready to hear it properly. And a damn fine ending it was, too (though the fireworks were a tad tame).</p>
<p>I was hugely impressed with the organisation of the thing. We got there nice and early, and there was hardly any queueing, despite the airport-style security. The staff were all lovely and friendly, and &ndash; get this &ndash; there was hardly ever a queue for the toilets!</p>
<p>I would strongly support any moves to make it a regular thing. Radio 1&rsquo;s event moves around the country, so it couldn&rsquo;t stay free, but I could easily see it working as a commercial festival in the future.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>This week, though, I&rsquo;ve been to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->presentation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clarke Award<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is held in association with the festival, and at its main venue; and last night, the whole family went to the BFI (or the NFT, I can&rsquo;t quite work out what its official name is these days) to see a film.</p>
<p>Which was <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dimensions<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a low-budget British film about time travel &ndash; or maybe dimension-hopping &ndash; which doesn&rsquo;t even have a distributor yet.</p>
<p>Which is a great shame, because despite some flaws it is a very enjoyable piece.  We were still talking about it at lunchtime today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also something of a costume drama, being set in the 1920s and 30s.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sci-Fi-London page about it<!-- raw HTML omitted --> likens it to Merchant-Ivory.</p>
<p>It did show its low-budget nature in one or two places, but nothing that destroys the overall effect.  The couple who made it (Ant Neely wrote and composed the original music, and Sloane U’Ren directed and did much else) had to sell their house to fund it, so almost anything can be forgiven.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say too much more about it here, but if you ever get a chance to see it, you should take it.</p>
<p>There was a Q&amp;A with writer, director, lead actor &amp; editor after the screening, which was very interesting.  I was geared up to ask a question, which would have gone something like this: &ldquo;When you make a time-travel story, especially in Britain, you&rsquo;re walking among some long shadows, especially Wells and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; to what extent would you acknowledge those as influences?&rdquo;  I had my hand up to speak, when the interviewer asked a question touching on exactly those points.  So I didn&rsquo;t ask.  Pity.  I would also have mentioned the fact that they have a mysterious wise man know only as &ldquo;the Professor&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Anyway, lots of fun: highly recommended.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Boris hasn&rsquo;t been quite the disaster we feared four years ago, but he still cares more about the richer members of society than everyone else. Plus, he&rsquo;s a Tory. But I repeat myself.</p>
<p>Ken seems kind of past his peak, but he&rsquo;s still the one for the job. Though I might give Jenny Jones my first vote and Ken my second. I think that&rsquo;s what I did last time, come to think o it.</p>
<p>For the Assembly it&rsquo;s going to be Labour all the way. I&rsquo;m not impressed with how they&rsquo;re doing in opposition at Westminster: the Tories are down, but they don&rsquo;t seem to be kicking. Kick harder, Milliband!  But to run London?  Obviously it&rsquo;s got to be the (relatively) good guys.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s surprising and slightly scary is the number of extreme-right parties who have put candidates up. obviously there&rsquo;s the BNP and UKIP: but who knew the National Front were still around?  Then there&rsquo;s ones with names like England First and Christians Against Marriage Equality. (Those names may not be exact, but I&rsquo;m on the Tube at the time of writing, so I can&rsquo;t check; but you get the gist.)</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s where we are today. Don&rsquo;t forget to vote if you can, folks.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I heard the policeman&rsquo;s wife on the radio.  She <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spoke calmly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about how getting the murderers off the streets was good for the community, and positively about the people who had bravely given evidence (at least one had to be given protection).</p>
<p>The odd, disturbing, and intelligence-community-related thing is that army intelligence had a tracker device in the car of one of the murderers, and at first they refused to reveal its details to the police undertaking the investigation.  The police had to threaten to get a warrant.  Then when they did provide the data, it turned out to have sections mysteriously missing.  You have to sympathise with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PSNI<!-- raw HTML omitted --> here: they had both the Continuity IRA bampots and the army working against them.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So what, this GCHQ codebreaker on secondment locked himself inside a bag using magic?  I&rsquo;m surprised that they&rsquo;re even considering that it might <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be murder here; or at least that someone has covered something up.  More importantly, there&rsquo;s the fact that the DNA evidence got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->messed up by a typo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Surely there&rsquo;s got to be a better way?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this business about the corruption in the Met.  Evidence allegedly deleted on the orders of crime gangs?  That&rsquo;s some scary stuff.

<p>It&rsquo;s also just long; and technical.  So feel free to ignore.  I won&rsquo;t be offended.</p>
<p>I rarely write about programming or other technical issues here, but I probably should do so more often.  Certainly in a case like this.</p>
<p>I often think about the many, many problems that I&rsquo;ve had help with from strangers on the internet; people who have taken the time to write blog posts, answers to questions on forums, or technology tutorials.  My job would barely be possible at times without the web.  Of course, we didn&rsquo;t have it back when I started in 1987; but we didn&rsquo;t do such complex things, with so many different languages and technologies.</p>
<p>Anyway, all these kind strangers have helped me, and I rarely find myself in a position to give anything back to the community.  So since I recently hit a problem that no-one else seems to have had, it&rsquo;s really my duty to describe it, and my solution, in the hope that it might be of use to someone down the line.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the solution to the problem with pass-by reference on WAS, and don&rsquo;t want to read the story of how I got there, you can jump straight to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New Bug<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We develop our main app using a fairly standard <!-- raw HTML omitted -->n-tier<!-- raw HTML omitted --> architecture using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JEE<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: web front end using JSPs and Struts; EJBs; a multiplicity of database platforms accessed using Spring.  All fairly standard stuff, whose purpose is to move financial messages around.</p>
<p>A lot of this was originally developed when I wasn&rsquo;t around (I was seconded to another department) and by contractors and others who are no longer with us.  So I take no responsibility for the stupidities that exist in codebase.  Or rather, I accept no blame.  I do, in fact, have responsibility for it; for keeping it going and developing it onwards now.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the bad choices that was made by the original developers of this version of the product, was that they should cache the results of database queries.  The users can define various criteria by which they want to select a set of messages to view; those get translated into SQL, which our Java code executes using JDBC.  Again, all standard stuff.  JDBC was designed for exactly that kind of thing.  Databases exist solely to do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So the wise and sensible developers decided that performance would be a problem if a query returned many rows from the database.  They decided that transferring the rows to the browser and allowing the user to scroll through them would be impossible.  So they designed a caching mechanism.</p>
<p>Thing is, JDBC has that kind of caching built right in.  And furthermore, they (our developers) included a limit: a maximum number of rows to return, which could be set to 50, 100, 500, or 1000.  Pretty reasonable, since any query that returned over 200 or so rows is likely to be less than useful, anyway.</p>
<p>But they still built that caching mechanism.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That&rsquo;s all right, though, I hear you say.  Cache the rows server-side in memory, return a subset to the user as they page through them.  It sounds fine.</p>
<p>True enough.  Except they didn&rsquo;t cache them in memory.  Oh no.  That would have been too sensible.  And might have caused performance problems (I&rsquo;m sure they thought, if they even considered they matter).  No, they cached them elsewhere.  Where?  In the database.</p>
<p>Yes, they introduced another table; a shadow table; an almost-identical duplicate of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Messages<!-- raw HTML omitted --> table, called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MessageQueryResults<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Executing a query then consisted of selecting the required rows and writing them into this table, keyed by the HTTP session ID; and then re-querying this results table to get a page worth of results.</p>
<p>So, to recap, then: to improve performance (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->without first determining that there was actually a problem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), they replaced a simple database read with a read, a set of writes, and another set of reads.</p>
<p>That was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bound<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to perform better, right?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t performance that brought this flimsy edifice crashing down, though.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> No, it actually ran quite successfully for several years.  Three things brought about its end: Microsoft, multiplicity, and me.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s part was through their database platform, SQL Server.  Between one version and another they changed something about their storage mechanism, so that you could no longer rely on rows on a table being in the sequence in which they were written to the table.  The thing is, you&rsquo;re not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->supposed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to be able to rely on that, according to DB theory.  That was another flaw in the &ldquo;design&rdquo; above; it relied on the shadow table&rsquo;s rows being returned in the same sequence they were written in.  On Oracle and DB2 that worked; and it did on SQL Server too, until (if memory serves) the 2005 version.  This meant that clients on that platform who had large queries couldn&rsquo;t rely on them being displayed in the right order.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>Hacks were applied to sort this out.  Pun intended: sorting is pretty much what they did.  Not a fix, but a workaround at best.</p>
<p>The multiplicity part was that the same mechanism was used to query another table; and then a third.  And there was a fourth on the horizon.  Each new table meant a new shadow table which had to be maintained in parallel &ndash; and whose creation and upgrade scripts had to be maintained across three database platforms.  A maintenance nightmare.</p>
<p>Then there was me.  I had known about the problem for some time, of course &ndash; I had done an estimate for fixing it &ndash; but there was never time to fix it.  It was a big task, quite intrusive, and showing no easily-provable customer benefit.  Yes, I know ease of maintenance, by making life easier for developers, is an implicit customer benefit; but try selling that to management, when there are customers crying out for new features.</p>
<p>But in the project that was to introduce the fourth table (or seventh and eighth, you might say) I was in a position to say, &ldquo;we fix this first, or it all goes to hell&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The user story was written.  I got my estimate out of hibernation (and increased it, of course).  And then I did the fix.  It was a great joy.  That in-memory caching mechanism I mentioned above?  I did that.   If I&rsquo;d been designing it from scratch I would almost certainly have relied on JDBC&rsquo;s internal caching, at least until it proved problematic.  But under the circumstances, when the code relied on there being a cache, it was going to be much less disruptive to retain one.  I just replaced the stupid one with a more sensible one.</p>
<p>Inevitably, though, I introduced a new bug.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is where I stop telling a story and start explaining the problem and solution.</p>
<p>Introducing the new message caching mechanism, which replaced the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MessageQueryResults<!-- raw HTML omitted --> table, inadvertently caused a problem when we set a WAS server to pass-by-reference mode.</p>
<p>This mode is recommended when the different tiers of the application (web, EJB) are running in the same JVM.  This is normally the case in our test environments, and frequently the case in client systems.  Enabling this mode removes the need for objects to be copied as they are passed through the tiers, and can improve performance dramatically in such environments.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Changing the caching mechanism caused no problem as long as pass-by-reference was off.  As soon as it was turned on, we noticed that taking certain actions, such as deleting a message, failed.</p>
<p>The failure was at a point in the code where the a value such as an amount was being retrieved from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that formed the new cache.  The failure was that the retrieved <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Object<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was being cast to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Number<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but what was in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> entry was actually a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->String<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>This <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> comes, by a fairly complex set of steps, from the new cache, and before that from the database itself, of course.</p>
<p>Now, since the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amount<!-- raw HTML omitted --> column on the DB is numeric, and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in question is originally populated via Spring from the DB, obviously the value was a numeric one originally.  This suggested that the value must have been changed, and that gave us the first clue to tracking down the cause of the problem, and coming up with a solution.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It seemed likely &ndash; and running debug, it was shown to be so &ndash; that the numeric value that was retrieved from the database and stored in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was being replaced by the edited value which is built for displaying.  In other words, the object now contained a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->String<!-- raw HTML omitted --> holding digits, a decimal point, and probably commas.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When the data was being passed by value, a new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, complete with its contents, was being passed from the EJB layer to the webapp.  The webapp then updated values in that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, editing them for display purposes.  But it was only changing its own copy; it had no effect on the version stored back in the EJB layer.  So when the same <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was retrieved again, so that the action could be performed, a new copy was received by the webapp.  No problem.</p>
<p>But when pass-by-reference is on, no copy is made.  The webapp receives a reference to the actual <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that is stored in the cache back in the EJB layer.  So when it updates an entry in that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it updates the very object that is stored in the cache (note that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->put<!-- raw HTML omitted --> method of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> interface will update the stored value if it receives a key that it already holds).</p>
<p>And then when the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and its entry are retrieved again for the action to be performed, it is the updated (and now wrong) version that is retrieved.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And yet both possible passing settings were available before we changed the caching mechanism.  Why did we not get this problem when using pass-by-reference with the old caching mechanism?</p>
<p>The answer to that is that the old mechanism cached the query results in the database itself, in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MessageQueryResults<!-- raw HTML omitted --> table.  Each time a set of results was requested by the webapp, the EJB layer went back to this temporary table and populated the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that it returned to the webapp.  So the amount value would always have been set up freshly from the numeric <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amount<!-- raw HTML omitted --> column, which ensured that it was an object of type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Number<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I tried making copies of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->List<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s used, at various points in the process, including using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ImmutableList<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ImmutableMap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google&rsquo;s Guava library<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in an attempt to prevent the value object of interest from being updated.  However, it wasn&rsquo;t possible to make them immutable deeply enough (and would probably have caused other problems if it had been).  That was largely because the principal <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is created and populated by Spring, so we don&rsquo;t have much control over it.</p>
<p>One solution &ndash; and probably the proper one &ndash; would have been to copy the entries from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at the point they are read and processed in the webapp.  This would have meant that the edited, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->String<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, version of amount would be a different, new object, and would not have been updated in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that came from the cache.</p>
<p>However, the vast complexity of the class where this would have had to happen made this seem like a very difficult and dangerous approach, especially at this late point in the project.</p>
<p>An alternative solution was suggested by one of my colleagues.  It was to accept the fact that the amount value might be a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->String<!-- raw HTML omitted --> containing a numeric value with commas and decimal point, and to parse the numeric value out of it.</p>
<p>This allowed us to cater for both numeric and string values, and it worked with either form of passing semantics.  But it felt like a hack, and I was sure it would come back to bite us.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It did.  The trigger this time was paging through the list of results; when you returned to a page you had already seen, you ended up with an object of the wrong kind coming out of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  If memory serves it was a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->String<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where it should have been a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Date<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>It was clearly another result of the data being edited for display and updated in-place in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  There are too many possible places in in the relevant method to rely on finding them all, so I returned to the &ldquo;probably the proper&rdquo; solution mentioned above.  I changed the relevant method such that it now returns a copy of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->List<!-- raw HTML omitted --> containing the required subset of the query results.  This is less straightforward than might be hoped, because copying a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->List<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, including by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> method of the implementing class, for example, tends to do a &ldquo;shallow copy&rdquo;, which means that you get a new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->List<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instance, but containing references to the same objects.</p>
<p>I wrote a method called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->copyList<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which iterates over a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->List<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and makes &ldquo;deep&rdquo; copies of a few expected types of object.  We may have to extend this method to handle other types, but I don&rsquo;t expect that at the moment.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There is a warning about this on IBM&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Best Practice: Using pass by reference for EJBs and servlets if in same JVM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page, but it&rsquo;s one of those typical contrived kind of examples that probably wouldn&rsquo;t really alert you to the possibility of something like my experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To set the pass-by-reference mode on or off, take the following steps in the WAS administrative console (this is WAS 6, it&rsquo;s probably different at other releases).</p>

<p>This warm autumn has done some weird things in our garden. The end of November in Hackney brought these new blooms out. They&rsquo;re still there now, though they won&rsquo;t be for long, now that it&rsquo;s proper winter.</p>
<p>Those pictures above are supposed to come out side-by-side, not one above the other, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working.  Oh well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t strictly following the rules (but they&rsquo;re only really guidelines, and optional at that) in that I wasn&rsquo;t starting a new novel this time.  I was carrying on the same one that I started last year, and I hadn&rsquo;t written many more in the interim.  I managed just under 15,000 words this year, which is slightly less than last time (and less than a tenth of my erstwhile OU Creative Writing classmate Karl&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->crazy figure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</p>
<p>It has, however, given me a new kickstart, and I intend to carry the momentum onwards, but at a more manageable rate.  My novel (working title <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Accidental Upgrade<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) currently stands at around 36,000 words.  I&rsquo;ve set myself a target of 80,000 by the end of February.  That is more like the length of a modern novel, and achievable at a rate of around 475 words a day, according to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scrivener<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much more feasible for me than Nano&rsquo;s 1667.  Though I&rsquo;m just realising that I said essentially the same thing last year, and it obviously didn&rsquo;t work.  Still, I feel more confident this time.  I wrote around 600 words today, and I&rsquo;ve got Scrivener to help me keep on track.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>My friend (Wee) John(ny) called a couple of days ago and said, “Do you fancy seeing The Damned at the Roundhouse?”  I’d never been to the Roundhouse, though it was one of those legendary London venues from my teenage years, like the Rainbow and the Hammersmith Palais.  And I hadn’t seen The Damned in (I thought)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> about 26 years.  Not since a seated gig in the Edinburgh Playhouse the night before I had a High-Energy Physics progress test the following morning.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I said “Yes”.  I mean, why the hell not?  I only really know <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Machine-Gun Etiquette<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a few singles, but what the hell.  They’re bound to do those, right?  It’s a 35th-anniversary thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/">The Roundhouse</a> is an amazing place.  As a former railway shed, it’s just a stunning space.  But it’s not the seedy old-school venue I half expected, because it’s been closed down and refurbished and reopened since the seventies.  So it’s really nice: more like The Barbican, say, than The Forum.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vivalbertine.com/">Viv Albertine</a> was supporting.  I expected her to have a band, but she just stood up there on her own, with a Telecaster as old as punk, and sang us songs of non-love and stuff.  She was great.</p>
<p>The Damned were… pretty much as I expected, actually.  They came on, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Sensible">Captain</a> said, “We’re going to do two ‘classic’ albums.”  (He did the air-quotes.)  I’m not sure about this recentish trend of doing a whole album live, but expect it could be good.  Mostly, though, I’m amused that for classic punk albums, one would be too short.</p>
<p>So they kicked off into ‘Neat Neat Neat’, and I realised that we were much too close to the front: actually <em>in</em> the moshpit. <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/08/26/hardcore-knows-the-score/">As I&rsquo;ve said</a>, I’m really past that — much though I might enjoy dancing in the abstract, or in private.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was all very wild and excellent, and there were many people with t-shirts of bands I’ve seen or haven’t seen but wish I had or don’t mind that I haven’t but recognise anyway.  In short, I was with, as Neil Gaiman describes it, my tribe.</p>
<p>It was all monstrously fine. Two albums with a break, then a few encores.  Which included, as expected, several non-those-album tracks.  ‘Love Song’, of course, they could hardly have avoided playing.  A couple of others, and then came ‘Eloise’, which, punked-up though it was, we could frankly have done without,</p>
<p>Then they played ‘Anti-pope’ and were gone.  I realise that the Roundhouse must have a strict 11 o’clock policy, but surely they were coming back…?  No.  DJ music and house lights… and no ‘Smash it Up’.  I must admit, if you had asked me before I went out tonight whether there was any chance that they wouldn’t play ‘Smash it Up’, I would have laughed at you.</p>
<p>Very strange.  And then there was a crazy queue to get out of the venue, because so many people had taken up the option to get an instant double CD of tonight’s gig.  They obviously burn them straight from the sound desk while the gig is on.  But it meant that you could hardly get out of the venue.  There has to be a better way than that.</p>
<p>Anyway, my ears are sizzling, and I still owe NaNoWriMo a load of words, so I’ll call it a night here.</p>

<p>(According to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Wikipedia article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the band, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jello Biafra<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was their roadie, which was a strange and surprising discovery.)</p>
<p>It reminded me that I have a fondness for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->list songs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which as you can see from the link, is a sufficiently real genre, or class, that it has its own entry.</p>
<p>So I made a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spotify playlist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of some I like.

<p>That&rsquo;s hardcore in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->punk sense<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not rap, or anything else.  All genres have a &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo; subgenre, it seems.  I&rsquo;m sure that somewhere there&rsquo;s hardcore pop.</p>
<p>Anyway, this album causes me to put together three words that I never thought I&rsquo;d see in the same sentence, never mind describing the same thing: punk rock opera.</p>
<p>I know, I know, rock operas are the bloated detritus of prog rock, and part of what we fought the punk wars against.  Though truth be told, I&rsquo;ve always been quite fond of <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tommy<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  But in a sense it was always something that was going to happen eventually.  When a genre or a medium has been around for a while, people will try to take it further than it has gone before, and that&rsquo;s no bad thing.</p>
<p>And when you get right down to it, it&rsquo;s all about storytelling, and who can complain about that?</p>
<p>So I was pointed in the direction of this album by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a post on Mike Sizemore&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Sizemore is a scriptwriter; I probably started reading his blog when someone like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Warren Ellis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pointed me at a teaser or &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->sizzle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; video he and some other people made for a prospective science fiction series.</p>
<p>Anyway, he posted a link to the video for the second track off the album, &lsquo;Queen of Hearts&rsquo;, and spoke very highly of it, as you&rsquo;ll have seen if you followed the link.  If you haven&rsquo;t, you should.  Go on, I&rsquo;ll wait.  I watched it a couple of times, and though, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK, interesting premise, I wish I could make out the words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I forget about it for a while.</p>
<p>But one day something made me go back.  I listened again.  I downloaded the album.  I fell in&hellip; not love, exactly, but fascination.</p>
<p>North American hardcore bands have a certain vocal style, which is certainly not to everyone&rsquo;s taste.  In that way, I realised, it&rsquo;s not unlike actual opera.  Sure, the vocal stylings are about as far apart as possible; but they are both very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stylised<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  And my biggest two problems with opera are that it&rsquo;s hard to make the words out (even when they&rsquo;re singing in english), and that I don&rsquo;t really like the vocal stylings.</p>
<p>Not to everyone&rsquo;s taste, as I said.</p>
<p>Luckily, operas tend to have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->surtitles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; and albums have lyric sheets.  The lyrics for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Comes to Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->available on the web<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as you might expect.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m writing about this now because I haven&rsquo;t got round to doing so before, but especially because I&rsquo;ve just got back from seeing Fucked Up live.  They were playing at a Shoreditch venue called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XOYO<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a &ldquo;co-headliner&rdquo; with a band called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OFF!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I tweeted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a lot about it, and among other things, I expressed a degree of concern as to what it would be like going to a hardcore gig:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hmm.  Not seen a hardcore gig since <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Napalm Death<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?  That may well be true, but they&rsquo;re British (and technically grindcore, according to Wikipedia).  I began to wonder whether I&rsquo;d <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ever<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seen a US (or Canadian) hardcore band live.  The only one I could think of were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hüsker Dü<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, whom I saw in Edinburgh in &ndash; oh, 84 or 85.</p>
<p>I feel sure there must have been others, and yet the only such band that I was really, really a fan of was the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dead Kennedys<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and if they ever played the UK it happened either without me knowing about it, or they only played far away from where I was, or both.</p>
<p>I needn&rsquo;t have worried, though.  The venue was just the right size, and comfortably packed.  The crowd were gentle and lovely.  The moshpit was pretty wild, but I turned 47 yesterday, which is officially way past too old for the moshpit, and I was well able to stay clear of it.</p>
<p>And it was a totally brilliant night.  The first band, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cerebral Ballzy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, were on when I arrived, so I heard three or four of their songs.  They sounded pretty good, and more to the point, the sound in the room was excellent.  Clear, and powerful, without being so loud as to be overwhelming.</p>
<p>OFF! were classic hardcore, in that if you didn&rsquo;t like a song there&rsquo;d be another along in way less than three minutes.  I thoroughly enjoyed them.</p>
<p>And Fucked Up just ruled.  I was thinking before they came on that I would leave happy as long as they played &lsquo;Queen of Hearts&rsquo;  And they duly opened with it!  They then proceeded to play edited highlights from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Comes to Life<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, interspersed with a few other tracks.  There was stage-diving, crowd-surfing, the singer diving topless into the audience and walking almost to the back of the venue while still singing (and using a wired mike, with a very long cable).</p>
<p>Anyway, if you&rsquo;ve read to the end of this rambling thing, you should go and listen to some things.  Here&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Queen of Hearts&rsquo; video, and it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever embedded a video.  Let&rsquo;s hope it works.  Note that this version has the kids in the video singing on it, which is not how it is on the album, but is very cool nonetheless.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And the second video from the album, &lsquo;The Other Shoe&rsquo;, which they also did tonight.</p>

<p>First we have <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Episodes<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (actually a British-American coproduction), starring Tamsin Greig and Stephen Mangan, in which a married-couple writing team go to Hollywood to adapt their hit British comedy show for the American market.

<p>Then there’s <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Campus<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which has some of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Green Wing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> writing team, and could lazily be described as “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Green Wing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but set in a university instead of a hospital”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If you are one such person, then I slightly envy you: you still have these joys ahead of you.  And with both of them, don’t worry if the first episode doesn’t overwhelm you; just watch the next, and you’ll be hooked.</p>

			 <p>I’ve not really had many dealings with the Huffington Post, but I thought I’d drop a comment on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this piece about a cover versions album of Nirvana’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nevermind<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The writer, Michael Vazquez, describes himself as being ‘part of the generation that just-missed Punk’, and goes on to say he’s 45.</p>
<p>Thing is, I’m just a year older, and I didn’t miss it. I lived right through it. Not, it’s true, at its bleeding, safety-pin-punctured heart.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But still, I was aware of it, was introduced to the music by friends, listened to Peelie. Formed <em>bands</em>, for god’s sake, which is what it was really all about.</p>
<p>I can only conclude that Vazquez was a late developer.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point wasn’t about that, it was about commenting at the Huffington Post. You have to be registered to comment; fair enough, that probably keeps the spam down a bit. There are a number of login options, as is common nowadays: Twitter, Facebook, a dropdown for others.</p>
<p>I tried the dropdown and chose to use my Google account. A popup pops up, saying, ‘This site wants to know your email address and your contacts.’ Email address, fair enough, that’s normal for registering at most places. But my Google contacts? I think not.</p>
<p>I cancelled, tried Twitter. ‘This site wants to see your contacts, add contacts, post tweets…’ Get, as we say in my part of the world, tae fuck!</p>
<p>Oddly, it asked less of Facebook; but I can’t be bothered going back to check exactly what.</p>
<p>In the end, not wanting to be thwarted, I registered with them by giving them a username and my email address, in the old-school way. Obviously I unchecked the ‘Please spam me’ box.</p>
<p>Is this normal behaviour nowadays? Certainly seems odd to me.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t ever since the days of the Tories.  Err, the old days of the Tories, I mean: the eighties; Thatcher; all that stuff we thought we&rsquo;d done away with in 1997.</p>
<p>My reasons are much the same as those I wrote about in my <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2002/12/13/when-do-we-forgive/">fourth ever blog entry</a>.  Then, I was talking about the Saatchis, and how their name was anathema to me, because of the fact that they had helped the Tories get in all through the Eighties.</p>
<p>I have long held a similar despite for the Murdoch papers; enhanced by the tabloid ones being such trivial pedlars of rubbish and prurience.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>My kids occasionally complain about the fact that we don&rsquo;t have Sky, but there are so many channels on Freeview (and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Friends<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Name Is Earl<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are on E4 so often) that I don&rsquo;t think they really mind.</p>
<p>And I must confess that, until the now-aborted bid to take 100% ownership of Sky, I thought Murdoch <em>did</em> own all of it.  Turns out we could have watched 60% of it for all those years.</p>
<p>No matter how negatively I feel towards the organisation and its organs, though, I would never have expected the degree of criminality that they were apparently practising; just as no matter how negatively I might sometimes have felt about the police, I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected such casual corruption from them.  In the end I think we&rsquo;ll understand that the police taking money from journalists is the worst thing about all this.</p>
<p>And yet on some level I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m that surprised; disappointed, certainly, but not really surprised.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all unravelling now, though, and we watch with joy and bated breath.</p>

<p>I had been hitting the festival website to try to find out who was on when, exactly.  There was a page which said (and still does, a the time of writing), &lsquo;<a href="http://londonfeis.com/event-info/">Band and Stage Times: To be released on the day</a>&rsquo;.  I had taken that to mean, &lsquo;&hellip; will be announced on the website on the day&rsquo;.  I did wonder about how much use that would be, considering many people would be getting on their way early in the morning, or the night before, and wouldn&rsquo;t have had the chance to look at the website.  Then again, everyone has a smartphone nowadays, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, it turned out that they meant, &hellip;. will be released at the festival.'  On the bus to Finsbury Park I searched Twitter for the expected #feis hashtag, wherein some nice person had tweeted pictures of the running order (I can&rsquo;t find those pictures now, but no matter).  It appeared we were missing The Undertones, but we would get there in time for The Waterboys.</p>
<p>As indeed we did.  We set up base camp near the back and listened to &lsquo;Be My Enemy&rsquo; (timely, as I recently read Christopher Brookmyre&rsquo;s novel which borrows that title) &lsquo;Fisherman&rsquo;s Blues&rsquo;, &lsquo;&hellip; And a Bang on the Ear&rsquo;, and of course, &lsquo;The Whole of the Moon&rsquo;.  It was great to see them again.  Well, hear them; we didn&rsquo;t see much from the back, and there were no big screens like at most festivals these days.</p>
<p>A trip to the second stage saw us Nanci Griffith, closely followed by Shane McGowan.  Always good to see he&rsquo;s still hanging in there, and he was in excellent voice.  I note that it&rsquo;s an alarming four and half years since I <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2006/01/06/the-rocky-pogue-to-brixton/">last saw The Pogues</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Heard a bit of The Cranberries while queueing for toilet and bar.  They were OK.  Some Irish youngsters at the bar sang along with &lsquo;Linger&rsquo; very sweetly.</p>
<p>Then back to the main stage for Christy Moore, food, and finally Dylan.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s him there in the white hat; can you tell?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long wait for me.  I know he&rsquo;s been over here in the last few years, but somehow I&rsquo;ve never managed to hear about the dates until it was too late.  Here we were, then, finally in the distant presence of the great man himself.</p>
<p>And it was, as I expected, like listening to him doing cover versions of his own songs.  But there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.  It was quite a &lsquo;greatest hits&rsquo; kind of set, though, to my surprise.  I had gained the impression that he mainly did newer songs these days, but there was a strong focus on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blood on the Tracks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Highway 61 Revisited<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  And you can&rsquo;t go far wrong with those.  <a href="http://www.examiner.com/bob-dylan-in-national/bob-dylan-set-list-london-feis-2011-finsbury-park-june-18-2011">Here&rsquo;s a full set list</a>.</p>
<p>The only possible singalong moment was the &lsquo;How does it feel?&rsquo; lines in &lsquo;Like Rolling Stone&rsquo;, and it made me wonder: maybe he started doing such changed versions of his songs because he doesn&rsquo;t like people singing along.</p>
<p>I thought this stall would do roaring trade, but the rain mostly stayed off.</p>

<p>Then Sunday was <a href="http://www.bl.uk/sciencefiction">Out of this World</a>, the Science Fiction thing at the British Library.  &lsquo;Science Fiction, but not as you know it&rsquo;, was the tag line.  In fact, it was pretty much exactly as i know it, but I guess I&rsquo;m part of some sort of rarefied elite, or something (or &lsquo;fans&rsquo; as we&rsquo;re known).</p>
<p>Anyway, it was very good, though perhaps it&rsquo;s limiting, being a library: much of the exhibition was books behind glass.  Which is fine, but sometimes you&rsquo;d like to pick them up and handle them.</p>
<p>There was a Tardis in a corner of the Time Travel section, and a robot that seemed to be modelled on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000">HAL 9000</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I saw him at a solo gig once, during the year I worked in Turin. He did a load of blues and rock standards, some of his own, and a couple of Springsteen songs. “Well what did you expect?” he said, “The Big Man wouldn’t be The Big Man without The Boss.”</p>
<p>And I saw the E-Street Band on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Born in the USA<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tour, where his sax, of course, tore the house down.  Always a neat trick at an outdoor gig.</p>

			 <p>I’m thoroughly looking forward to this weekend.  Not only is it the <a href="http://londonfeis.com/">London Feis</a> festival tomorrow, with Bob Dylan headlining, but Sunday being Father’s Day, my treat is a visit to the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/sciencefiction">SF exhibition</a> at the British Library.</p>
<p>Let’s hope it all goes well; the weather forecast is rain, and at least three-quarters of the family are poorly.</p>

<p>Home was via bookshop, Pizza Express, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Little Fockers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at the cinema (ignore the critics: it&rsquo;s loadsa fun; unless you didn&rsquo;t like the first two, of course).</p>
<p>Oh, but before all that, we had tried to play basketball in Millfields Park.  But there was an annoying dog-owner who couldn&rsquo;t control her Alsatian.  The latter proceeded to bite our basketball till it burst.  When we remonstrated with the owner, she ran off.</p>
<p>At least it was only the basketball that got bitten.</p>
<p>The next day brought an early start.  Neither London&rsquo;s young skaters nor anybody else gets up very early on New Year&rsquo;s Bank Holiday Monday, it seems.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen London streets so empty.  The drive in to the Aldwych area for the start of skating at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Somerset House<!-- raw HTML omitted --> felt like driving through a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jerry Cornelius<!-- raw HTML omitted --> novel: &ldquo;Martin tooled the big <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Duesenberg<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Skoda down Roseberry Avenue&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t skate any more.  I did it twice when I was a student, and I think once since I had kids.  From the student times, I remember enjoying it, but getting very wet and very bruised.  With kids I didn&rsquo;t fall over so much, but only through caution, not because I had magically become able to skate.</p>
<p>Anyway, what with one thing and another, I didn&rsquo;t do it through all those intervening years, and by the time my kids were old enough to be interested and able, I had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->broken my cruciate ligament<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a freak gardening accident.  I probably could do it now, but I&rsquo;m too scared of re-injuring my knee.</p>
<p>So I sat in the warmth of &ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s Skate Lounge&rdquo; and had a Cappuccino and a Danish, and took photographs and notes, while our party slowly, but with increasing confidence, circled the ice.  I loved the fact that the staff members who were on the ice had hi-viz vests saying &ldquo;Ice Marshall&rdquo;.  There&rsquo;s something very pleasing about that term.</p>
<p>After that we drove on out to South Kensington, and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Natural History Museum<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Ostensibly to see the dinosaurs.  But of course, the other half of London had decided to do the same.  After queueing for maybe twenty minutes to get inside, we found a 45-minute queue for the dinosaurs.  So we elected for the blue whale, via the other mammals, instead.</p>
<p>Which was of course, fabulous.  Wonderful place, the Natural History Museum.  Actually, London&rsquo;s pretty wonderful.</p>

<p>The initial weirdnesses (I&rsquo;ve never used a Mac before, apart from once very briefly, before OS/X) include the absence of a hash-key (though you can get the character using Alt+3: #); the plethora of modifier keys: Ctrl and Alt, of course, but also Cmd and Fn.  Though actually, most laptops have Fn, so it&rsquo;s really just one extra.  But they get a lot of use.</p>
<p>The nicest thing is probably the multitouch trackpad: scroll with two fingers, navigate with three, do some other weird navigation thing (Exposé, I think it&rsquo;s called) with four.  Pure dead brilliant, in the vernacular of my homeland.</p>
<p>Most annoying thing is the American positioning of the @ and &quot; keys.  I&rsquo;d like to remap those back to where my muscle-memory says they should be, but haven&rsquo;t worked out how to do that yet.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And making my brain sparkle is exactly the effect reading this had on me.  I absolutely loved every minute of it (except, perhaps, the long detour over the pole).  And the unusual thing about is this: it made me think, &ldquo;Come on, get the action out of the way, and get back to the talking and philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go in to any detail.  There are plenty of places you can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->read more about it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  A wonderful, wonderful book.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As is this one.  There has been a lot written about this, too.  I, of course, approached it with genre in mind, and was amused from the start by the review-quotes on the cover; notably The Observer&rsquo;s assertion that it is &ldquo;startlingly original&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about someone who randomly travels in time along their own timeline.   I kept thinking, &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  I kept thinking, &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know where I came from, but what about all you zombies?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; (which quote I misremembered; it is actually &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;but where did all you zombies come from?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;)</p>
<p>I even thought, &ldquo;Spoilers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hello Sweetie.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;, but a quick check of the publication date informs me that it actually pre-dates new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so maybe Moffat was influenced by this.</p>
<p>Anyway, all those touchpoints are largely irrelevant, as this is not a work of science fiction at all (it makes no attempt to explain the time-travel mechanism, though does assign it some genetic connection).  It is, rather, a love story with slightly unusual constraints.  And very well told, though I&rsquo;m a tad unhappy with the ending.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I am with the ending of this one.  It&rsquo;s a fine story, though, set in a future Edinburgh where global warming has been partially turned back by technology, and there are space elevators and fully-conscious robots and other AIs.  It&rsquo;s a crime story, with the main character being a cop.</p>
<p>Edinburgh&rsquo;s SF writers seem to be trying to get a bit of Iain Rankine&rsquo;s territory these days.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Charlie being the other of those I&rsquo;m alluding to there.  Here, though, we&rsquo;re back in his &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Merchant Princes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series.  I&rsquo;ve reviewed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->second<!-- raw HTML omitted --> volumes before.</p>
<p>I said before that it was hard to believe how successful Miriam Beckstein is, given the radical changes that have happened to her.  In this one she is much more circumscribed, by her odd family.</p>
<p>Relatively little happens here, really, but a lot is set in place for the following volumes.  The main thing is that her worlds are starting to collide.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Worlds colliding here, too.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read a Brookmyre since his first, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quite Ugly One Morning<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I remember thoroughly enjoying.  Not enough, though, to read any intervening ones.</p>
<p>This one is very different.  It has soldiers, scientists, priests, demons, and schoolkids.  It&rsquo;s great fun.</p>
<p>There is a wildly-glaring plot hole at the end.  My son read the book after me, and it was the first thing he said to me about it when he&rsquo;d finished.  We both hope it&rsquo;s deliberate, meaning that Brookmyre has a sequel planned.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<h3 id="jamaica-and-senegal-make-music">Jamaica and Senegal Make Music</h3>
<p>A couple of weeks ago we went to the Barbican to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youssou_N%27Dour">Youssou N&rsquo;Dour</a>.  In support were an acoustic reggae band called <a href="http://www.makasound.com/ms_boutique.php?id_famille=2&amp;id_rubrique=45">Inna da Yard</a>.  They were fabulous fun, and reminded me that I&rsquo;ve been missing out on reggae since John Peel died.</p>
<p>Youssou and his band were amazing.  They had more percussionists on stage than most bands have members (five, counting the drummer), which amused me.</p>
<p>The total number of musicians on stage was about sixteen.  Plus they had a couple of amazing dancers.</p>
<p>And the professionals weren&rsquo;t the only ones dancing on the stage.  Several times members of the audience got up and joined in.  Yes, a veritable stage invasion in the Barbican.  The security people looked vaguely worried; I didn&rsquo;t know the Barbican even <em>had</em> security.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t try to <a href="http://www.paclink.com/~ascott/they/tamildaa.htm">dance about architecture</a> and describe the music, but let&rsquo;s just say it was the rockingest gig I&rsquo;ve been to at that venue.</p>
<h3 id="the-glass-eye">The Glass Eye</h3>
<p>A few days later it was off to the Hackney Empire, where we saw the original 1931 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dracula<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with a live soundtrack.  Which was composed by <a href="http://www.philipglass.com/">Philip Glass</a>, and performed by him, Michael Riesman, and <a href="http://www.kronosquartet.org/">The Kronos Quartet</a>.  That&rsquo;s a pretty stellar lineup from the modern classical world.</p>
<p>I had at first thought that the film was silent, but it isn&rsquo;t (I think I was confusing it with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nosferatu<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  Apparently it didn&rsquo;t originally have a musical soundtrack, though.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s clear that the film is the origin (or <em>an</em> origin) of many horror film clichés, and the story is of course very familiar, I don&rsquo;t think I had ever seen it before &ndash; though I thought I had.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing, though the film volume could have done with being louder, as the music drowned out the dialogue at times.  And on a related note, I&rsquo;m not convinced that the music was always only there to serve the film, as a true soundtrack should be.</p>
<p>But all in all a fascinating night.</p>

<p>I was thinking about the literal, physical flowers that some misguided people had laid on the river bank where Raoul Moat died. Misguided, or possibly, grieving family members. Just because someone is a murderer, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that no-one grieves for their death.</p>
<p>But now, it seems, things have gone beyond that. Facebook tribute pages celebrating Moat&rsquo;s life, and especially his last few days in hiding from the police.</p>
<p>Go on the run, camp out for a bit, become a kind of hero: all very well (though I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;d recommend it as a career path) if the  crime were minor, or victimless.</p>
<p>But this guy murdered a man, and shot two other people. One of them has been left blind. The other is still in hospital.</p>
<p>This guy wasn&rsquo;t some Robin Hood figure. He was in no way a good guy. He was a grade &lsquo;A&rsquo; bampot, a fuckpig of the first water. And I&rsquo;m disgusted that anyone could think of celebrating his acts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>My initial reaction to the Liberal Democrats' decision to form a coalition with the Tories was a combination of disappointment and a sense of betrayal (with a side order of impending doom, of course).</p>
<p>I was, perhaps, naive.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I said<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I was voting LibDem, and that I actively wanted Labour to lose (while stressing that I wanted the Tories to lose even more).  I was, I think, hoping for a hung parliament, which of course is what we got.  But I was labouring (heh!) under the delusion that the LibDems were ideologically relatively close to Labour, and far enough away from the Tories that siding with them would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>Clearly I was wrong.</p>
<p>I had convinced myself that the only reaction of the LibDems to a hung parliament would be to join with Labour; and that seemed like the best possible solution.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On election day my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tony<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Facebooked to the effect that he had wasted his vote (and it&rsquo;s really annoying that, as far as I know, there&rsquo;s no way to link to an update or a comment in Facebook).  I answered:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My son made the same point when I told him about that discussion.  Diane Abbott got 54% of the vote in Hackney North and Stoke Newington.  (That&rsquo;s a proper majority.)  My vote wouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference, though, would it?</p>
<p>But in the days immediately after the election, as Clegg took his party into talks with the hated Tories, I began to regret my decision.  It really felt like I had &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; my vote; or maybe misused is the better word.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->coalition document<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that they published today is remarkable.  If you&rsquo;ve read any of my political posts over the years, you&rsquo;ll know that the biggest thing going on for me for some time has been ID cards, and all the associated post-9/11 terror-panic fallout.  So to read this, from the wordprocessor of the Tories (and LibDems) is remarkable:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And a few other points are good.  As my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stuart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> said:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(Gotta keep  embedding those tweets, you know.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;m no economist; but as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I said before<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I don&rsquo;t trust right-wingers to run the economy.  And right now, I have a gut feeling that cutting back on public spending during a recession is exactly the wrong thing to do (cutting back on most public spending is nearly always the wrong thing to do, of course).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In conclusion, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree with Charlie<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, pretty much.  I don&rsquo;t trust the Tories, but let&rsquo;s see whether Clegg &amp; co can keep this thing on track.  And let&rsquo;s keep a close eye on them all, and keep that list above in mind.</p>
<p>You never know: maybe this really is &ldquo;The New Politics&rdquo;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been boundary-changed, and it&rsquo;s made it harder to decide who to vote for.</p>
<p>At the last election (and until a couple of weeks ago) We were in Hackney South and Shoreditch, which was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Meg Hillier&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> constituency.  Meg wasn&rsquo;t a bad constituency MP, at least inasmuch as she answered my emails the few times I got in touch with her.  Not always in ways I agreed with, but still.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;ID Meg&rdquo;, as I liked to think of her, was the government minister for ID Cards and the Database state; the biggest issue at all recent elections for me.  Amusing, really, that she got into that role, if you consider <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my correspondence with her in 2005<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If we had lived on the other side of our street back then, we&rsquo;d have been in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Diane Abbott&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> constituency.  She was opposed to the war, and to ID cards.  Plus I like her on the telly (though some, apparently, complain about her second job; at least it&rsquo;s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->political programme<!-- raw HTML omitted --> she&rsquo;s on, even if it&rsquo;s lightweight to the point of triviality).</p>
<p>Five years ago I&rsquo;d have voted for Diane.  Today, with the boundary change, we&rsquo;re in Hackney North and Stoke Newington, so I can.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all gone too far.  Our electoral system is too fucked up; our Labour party is too fucked up, too corrupt.  They have developed an alarming reflexive response, it seems, to always do exactly the wrong thing.  A hung parliament &ndash; or, hey: a Liberal Democrat majority &ndash; might be just the change we need.</p>
<p>At least that way there&rsquo;s a chance we&rsquo;d get some taste of electoral reform.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Diane&rsquo;s leaflet came through the door today, and it tells me that she&rsquo;s still against ID cards and the Iraq war.  Why, then, I have to ask, does she still retain the Labour whip?  It would be more honourable to resign.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t honourably vote for the former Labour party any more (not that I did <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but remember, I was actively against the candidate then, too).  We&rsquo;ve come a long way now: we&rsquo;ve reached the stage where I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->want<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Labour to lose.  It&rsquo;s a strange place to find myself.</p>
<p>Maybe, I&rsquo;ve always been more of a natural LibDem voter anyway.  Any time I&rsquo;ve done those &ldquo;Political Compass&rdquo;-type questionnaires, they tell me that the LibDems most closely match my answers.</p>
<p>But even more than wanting Labour to lose, I want the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tories<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to lose.  I remain profoundly mistrustful of them; I lived through the Thatcher years, you know?  And It&rsquo;s clear that, no matter how shiny Cameron may be, lots of his members remain the same old bastards.  Witness this &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I cure gays<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; bollocks from Phlippa Stroud.  And Cameron has now backed her, I see.  And she has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->denied it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So much for that.  We know the Tories are the opposite of socially liberal; we know they take a reflexive antagonism to supporting public services; and we know we can&rsquo;t trust them with the economy (you never can trust right wingers, because they believe the market is guided by an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->invisible hand<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; I mean, come <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So now Brown is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->saying<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, &lsquo;Vote for the kind of country you believe in; and come home to Labour.&rsquo;  Sorry, mon: Labour no longer represents the kind of country I believe in.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Keith Angus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will be getting my vote.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>As with <a href="http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/04/03/that-reporting-back-from-eastercon-business/" title="Eastercon 2008">two years ago</a>, my son wanted to come.  And since my daughter did as well, my beloved bit the bullet and came along too.  SF isn&rsquo;t totally her thing, but I think she may have enjoyed the weekend more than any of us.</p>
<p>The telling detail was this: there are lots of things to do.</p>
<p>I tend to use cons as a way of seeing friends that I haven&rsquo;t seen for a while &ndash; often not since the last con I was at.  So I mainly hang out in the bar.  Or that, at least, is the impression I gave &ndash; give &ndash; to people who don&rsquo;t go to cons.</p>
<p>In fact, I have always gone to programme items.  I guess I just never made a big thing of them when I got home.</p>
<p>This con &ndash; <a href="http://www.odyssey2010.org/">Odyssey 2010</a> &ndash; had a particularly good set of programme items for kids.  There were hands-on science workshops, making Dalek cakes, and building string-propelled robots (my son won a prize for the best ramp-mounting attempt).  And not least, a thrilling battle between various knights of the <a href="http://www.sca.org/">Society for Creative Anachronism</a> (SCA).</p>
<p>The programme was full of fascinating and fun things, many of which I wanted to see, but didn&rsquo;t manage to, as ever.</p>
<p>And of course, I saw a lot of old friends, and had a good time hanging out in the bar with them.</p>
<p>We only stayed for the Friday and Saturday nights, to keep costs down.  But after going home on the Sunday (and watching the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doctor Who<!-- raw HTML omitted --> again), we went back on the Monday, and spent most of the day back at the <a href="http://www.radissonedwardian.com/londonuk_heathrow" title="The Eastercon 2010 Hotel">Radisson</a> <a href="http://www.radissonedwardian.com/londonuk_heathrow" title="The Eastercon 2010 Hotel">Radisson</a>.</p>
<p>Travelling all across London was a bit of drag, but it was a lot shorter than many people&rsquo;s journeys.  And of course, there was absolutely no chance of [ash-induced delays] <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/europe/2010/iceland_volcano/default.stm">volcano</a>.</p>
<p>Am I a bad person because I found all the volcanic disruption kind of amusing and quite fun, really?  The cloudless and contrail-free blue skies over London were gorgeous, and it was interesting to follow people&rsquo;s tweets of how they were striving to get home.  And a world with a lot fewer flights is something we&rsquo;re probably going to have to face in the future.</p>
<p>What annoyed me about it all were the idiots who blamed the government.  Marginally more sensible than blaming &lsquo;god&rsquo;, I suppose<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but even if anything other than sending in the Navy had been the government&rsquo;s decision, can you imagine the fuss if flights had been allowed to go ahead, and there <em>had</em> been a disaster?</p>
<p>Plus, the idea of getting a trip home on the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Ark_Royal" title="Not the original one, though">Ark Royal</a></em> is pretty cool.</p>

It&rsquo;s from 1999, it turns out, but I&rsquo;ve only known it for a year or two.  The first half of Monday&rsquo;s show contained a good number of songs from it, and also some from the recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Distortion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The highlight for my boy wasn&rsquo;t even a Magnetic Fields song at all, but rather one by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Gothic Archies<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one of their several alter egos.  It also featured the only instance in the evening of singing along with the band; and that was just him, quietly singing &lsquo;Shipwrecked&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We were right up at the back of the balcony, but despite the distance and low volume, we could still hear everything perfectly.  Well, except when they spoke between songs.  The vocal mix wasn&rsquo;t really designed for making that kind of thing audible at the back.</p>
<p>In fact Merritt&rsquo;s vocals were at their best during the final song, when he took the mike off the stand and walked about.  That got him closer to the mike, which suits his croonerish voice.</p>
<p>So they sent us off into the night with a fabulous &lsquo;Papa was a Rodeo&rsquo;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Now, as SF readers we are used to jumping into new worlds, not quite knowing what&rsquo;s going on, and picking it up as we go along.  Indeed, that&rsquo;s part of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->toolkit for reading it (SF reading protocols at Tor.com)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But here, there was something just not quite right, I felt.  It was as if there was too much understanding assumed.  Had the writer spent too long with her world, I wondered?  So long that she could no longer tell what the reader would and wouldn&rsquo;t know, since she knew it so intimately?</p>
<p>When I finished it I went looking for reviews, to see whether others had the same feeling as me.  And what I found proved that, in a sense, I was right about her assuming too much knowledge.</p>
<p>It turns out the book is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sequel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Oh yes.  It&rsquo;s the sequel to her previous book, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Natural History<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Which is fine.  But nowhere on the book itself does it tell you that.  Nowhere.  I&rsquo;ve checked again and again: it&rsquo;s not in the blurb, it&rsquo;s not on the title page, it&rsquo;s not in the front matter.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I would have liked to have known this little detail before I started reading.  Sure, you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pick things up as you go along; and now that I know it, I realise that she gave us the necessary backstory very well.  But really, Pan MacMillan: next time, let us know, OK?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>selling out is when you go against your own heart, ideals and authenticity to make money.</p>
<p>selling out is an action, a 180 from a stated position.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean the slightly-ambiguous, could-be-a-dream-or-somebody&rsquo;s-madness-if-you-don&rsquo;t-want-to-suspend-your-disbelief sort of thing you get in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bridge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Walking On Glass<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, either.  This is out-and-out SF, no  queries or discussion.  It is a tale of parallel universes, of an infinity of alternative Earths, and of people who can move between them, using a combination of drugs and native ability.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that ability that holds both one of the novel&rsquo;s unanswered moral questions, and its biggest flaw.</p>
<p>When adepts transition between the worlds, they do so in mind only.  That is, their mind occupies - possesses - the body of someone who already exists on the target parallel.</p>
<p>Ethically, this is a minefield, of course.  But that question is only vaguely touched on.</p>
<p>Other ethical issues are addressed, notably the use of torture by states.  There is passing character - just a walk-on, really - of a policeman who once tortured a terrorist suspect and had some success.  He was tortured in turn by his guilt for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>The big flaw, though, concerns the transition mechanism and its use, and to talk about it, I&rsquo;ll have to include some minor spoilers.  So, you know: you have been warned.</p>
<p>As I said, flitting between the parallel universes involves the mind, the personality of the transitionary jumping into the body of someone already existing on the target parallel.  This applies even when someone takes a &lsquo;passenger&rsquo; along, which some can do.  Each of them takes over a body in the new world.</p>
<p>But sometimes Banks has characters jumping to places where there really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->couldn&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be a body for them to take over (versions of the Earth that are uninhabited, for example).  Yet they seem to jump successfully.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind there being a &lsquo;bodiless&rsquo; and a &lsquo;bodiful&rsquo; version of the ability, for example: but it does need to be explained, or at least mentioned.  I can hardly believe that nobody picked this up in the revision and editing process.</p>
<p>That aside, though, it&rsquo;s damn fine, and probably his best &lsquo;non-M&rsquo; for quite a few years.</p>
<p>With the secret cabal that is trying to run the world(s) behind the scenes, it is sort of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Business 2.0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Or maybe 10.0.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that hated it; or even that I didn&rsquo;t like it.  Nor, indeed. was the prose hard or complex.  It just didn&rsquo;t grab me; didn&rsquo;t interest me that much.  I didn&rsquo;t, in the end, care that much about the characters or what happened to them.  The character, really, since it&rsquo;s mainly about the journalist and poet Ka.</p>
<p>In part, I think that&rsquo;s because of the overall structure, and one or two narrative devices.  It&rsquo;s a third-person limited-omniscient narrative, focalised on Ka.  Except it&rsquo;s not: there&rsquo;s a first-person narrator, a novelist called Pamuk, who is Ka&rsquo;s friend, and is telling his story.  He only appears directly in the novel twice, though.</p>
<p>So it starts out as Ka&rsquo;s story, and eventually becomes a fragment of &lsquo;Pamuk&rsquo;s&rsquo;.  Along the way, though, while we are in the middle of the story of Ka&rsquo;s few days in the Turkish border town of Kars, the end of his story is spoiled for us.  It is literally <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spoilered<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with a chapter in which is four years later, and &lsquo;Pamuk&rsquo; is in Frankfurt, going through Ka&rsquo;s things after the latter has been murdered.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also told he doesn&rsquo;t get the girl.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s back to the main story.  And you expect me to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->care<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure you can call it a novel of character, for there, isn&rsquo;t the character supposed to grow, develop, learn something?  He certainly goes through various experiences, and probably does change; but I&rsquo;m not sure that we can tell whether he has developed or grown, not least because we are robbed of any final scene with him, of anything on how he leaves Kars, of anything on his life afterwards.  All that is only told to us as if second-hand, and in a very fragmentary, incomplete and unreliable form.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partly a novel about Turkey, of course, about its stresses: the &lsquo;headscarf girls&rsquo;, who want to wear the Islamic garment to college, where it is banned; the epidemic of suicides of girls and young women which plagues Kars; the tension between the urges to democratic, religious and military rule.  I certainly know more about (one person&rsquo;s vision of) contemporary Turkey now than I did before I started.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t help but wonder: what was the point of it, really?  Plot, character, great prose: two of them can sustain a novel; even any one of them, if it&rsquo;s good enough.  But this didn&rsquo;t really have much of any of them.</p>
<p>Yet this guy has won the Nobel Prize for Literature, so he must be doing something right.</p>

<p>This third volume is the best of the three.  I enjoyed it so much that, towards the end (that is, in the last two-hundred-or-so pages) I found myself sometimes avoiding reading it, because I didn&rsquo;t want it to be over.</p>

<p>Or at least, their logos do; seeing the Michelin Man, for instance, sets her off in a particularly bad way. She has a corresponding - and possibly linked - talent, which is that she can reliably tell whether a new logo, for example, is going to work; and she can spot trends that are developing on the street. Using these abilities she is able to make a pretty good living by acting as a freelance consultant to marketing people, advertisers, and so on.</p>
<p>It sounds like a pretty shallow kind of life, but she&rsquo;s an engaging character, and Gibson manages both to make her role seem interesting, and to enmesh her in an international plot that keeps the pages turning.</p>
<p>The main weakness, perhaps, is that you never get the sense that she&rsquo;s in any real danger. And the mysteries that she ends up investigating find their solutions too easily.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Gibson has written anything really startling since his debut, but this is a fun enough read.</p>
<p>I always tend to touch on genre here, but I make no apologies for it. The odd thing here is that, while is clearly <em>not</em> SF in terms of setting and content (it&rsquo;s the very near future of the time it was written, which makes it our very near past, and has some already-surprising spots that feel like anachronisms, but aren&rsquo;t: like connecting a new laptop to a new phone by wire, rather than Bluetooth; and the only speculative content is Cayce&rsquo;s curious affliction/ability), it still <em>feels</em> like SF. And I&rsquo;m not sure entirely why that is. Gibson&rsquo;s style is no doubt part of it, and the rest must be theme: it does, after all, address the way the world is changing, and the effect those changes are having on the people that live through them.</p>
<p>The curious thing, really, is that such themes should trigger an <em>SF</em> response in the reader (or writer) What does it say about &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; literature if that genre <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> address the world today?</p>

<p>The same characters recur throughout, though in different combinations.  Or at least, the same character <!-- raw HTML omitted -->names<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It&rsquo;s not at all clear that, where a name recurs, it is meant to be the same person.  Indeed, the author says as much in his blurb.</p>
<p>The main link between them all is that they are all in some way or another about love.  In fact, a better title might be something like, &lsquo;A Series of Tales About Love&rsquo;, or even, &lsquo;A Series of Loving Events&rsquo;.  The title comes from Handler&rsquo;s assertion that, essentially, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what we do, it&rsquo;s how we do it&rdquo;, and the fact that each of the stories (or chapters) has an adverbal title: &lsquo;Particularly&rsquo;, &lsquo;Briefly&rsquo;, &lsquo;Not Particularly&rsquo;, and so on.</p>
<p>It all gets a bit meta in the middle, where Handler breaks the fourth wall and addresses the reader directly.</p>
<p>And it has a soundtrack album, in two senses: throughout the book, there are references to bands and songs, so you could construct a suitable playlist from that.  But given Handler&rsquo;s alternative career as a musician and member of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Magnetic Fields<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the album to play while reading it is undoubtedly their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->69 Love Songs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  You&rsquo;ll find many themes in common and overlap between book and album.</p>
<p>All in all it&rsquo;s thoroughly enjoyable, but doesn&rsquo;t really go anywhere - it doesn&rsquo;t have a plot, after all - and is kind of inconclusive.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>The story is not bad, but not that great.  In a post-collapse America, corruption and gang violence are rife, and the government (perhaps all the governments of the world) have left Earth, and are still ruling (or trying to) from Mars.  On Earth the law - and to some extent, the peace - is kept by the Plexus Rangers.  Or rather, as you eventually realise, the PlexUS Rangers, since there are also PlexUSSR Rangers.  The Plex is the overall world government.  Or something.</p>
<p>Reuben Flagg was a video star (ie TV or movie: there&rsquo;s a lot about &lsquo;video&rsquo; here, but it&rsquo;s pretty much all broadcast stuff) on Mars.  He played the eponymous &lsquo;Mark Thrust, Sexus Ranger&rsquo;.  But new technology has made actors unnecessary, and he has volunteered as a Plexus Ranger and been sent to Earth, to Chicago.</p>
<p>He is the one (relatively) good man in a corrupt environment, and with the help of a clumsy android, a talking cat, and various women in their underwear, he tries to keep things under control.</p>
<p>Oh yes, the underwear thing: Chaykin is unable, it seems to draw women wearing anything other than basques, stockings and suspenders.  No matter what they&rsquo;re doing, pretty much.  There&rsquo;s nothing like wearing your fetishes on your sleeve, I suppose.  Or, you know, lower down.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Writing about this novel is kind of embarassing for me, because I had the chance to make it better than it is, and I, er, blew it because I read too slowly.</p>
<p>See, I was on quite a large list of people who saw a draft version of this, a year or two ago.  I read most of it (or all of it, but it was incomplete, I can&rsquo;t quite remember) and noted some mistakes and flaws.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t get them all recorded properly and submitted to Charlie before the deadline.  And now, when I read the published version, I find they&rsquo;re all still there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing  dramatic, nothing plot-shattering (although there are one or two places where things could be clearer, and where the cracks aren&rsquo;t fully papered over: you can see where a section has been moved for dramatic purposes, but the knowledge of the protagonists hasn&rsquo;t been adjusted to mark the events' new location in the overall plot, for example).  It&rsquo;s mainly just niggles, misuses of terminology (school years called &lsquo;primary third&rsquo;, and &lsquo;secondary two&rsquo;, instead of &lsquo;primary three&rsquo; and &lsquo;second year&rsquo;, respectively, for example).  So, just some minor distractions.  And the spelling of &lsquo;dreich&rsquo; as &lsquo;dreicht&rsquo; throughout is curious.</p>
<p>But no matter.  Much more interesting are the questions of how well the multiple-viewpoint second person narration works; and is the story any good?</p>
<p>On the first point, I had no trouble with the second-person narrative at all, and it being multiple-person is effectively no different from any other book that does that.  There is rarely any confusion, not least because each chapter includes the VP character&rsquo;s name as part of its title.</p>
<p>The story is interesting, and it investigates an area - that of security in our increasingly-networked world - that is very important, and will only get more so in the near future.  But I&rsquo;m not, in all honesty, sure that it really works.  The various parts don&rsquo;t quite gel.</p>
<p>And yet, I enjoyed reading it.  I enjoyed being on the trip, I just look back at it and think, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that great.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Still, it was his debut, so maybe the thing is to try some of his later work (I should also add that, at the time of publishing, if not the time of reading or writing, I am regularly reading and enjoying <a href="http://freakangels.com/">FreakAngels</a>).</p>
<p>I should probably mention the artwork, not least since I met the artist at Eastercon.  It&rsquo;s similar, actually, in that, while it&rsquo;s perfectly fine, I kind of hoped it would be better.  I couldn&rsquo;t say that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with it: you can always tell what&rsquo;s going on, for example.  I think maybe it&rsquo;s that the style is a bit too cartoonish for the material.</p>
<p>The eponymous Lazarus is four hundred years old, and as far as he knows, immortal and indestructible, by virtue of some large percentage of his body having been replaced with smart plastics.  He&rsquo;s the only one in this condition, though, and he&rsquo;s not happy about it.  The main driver of the plot is his desire to die; or at least, we are led to understand that this will be the main driver.  In fact it&rsquo;s not, and each episode within the overall work has its own antagonism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of extreme violence and brutality, some interesting ideas, but it&rsquo;s sadly unmemorable.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting, dark story, and I&rsquo;m not totally sure how I feel about it.  It straddles the SF/fantasy divide, at least in the sense that it is set in the far future, there are hints of spaceflight being common, and there is much genetic and somatic manipulation; but there are also talking animals.</p>
<p>Of course, the talking animals (mainly meerkats) are enabled by the genetic engineering, so really it&rsquo;s unabashedly SF.  However, Shadrach&rsquo;s descent into the literal underworld of the levels below the city are straight out of mythology.  And the description of the organ bank, while striking, are just fanciful to the point of unbelievability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first thing I&rsquo;ve read by Vandermeer, and while I enjoyed it, it doesn&rsquo;t immediately make me want to go out and read more.  That said, his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->City of Saints and Madmen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does attract me, if only because it&rsquo;s such a great title.  I keep hearing (well, reading) people referring to him recently, so I don&rsquo;t doubt that he&rsquo;s got a lot to offer.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Not least about the assertion that Paul quotes (without holding that opinion himself) that Jeff Buckley&rsquo;s version is &ldquo;often described as definitive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I had heard Buckley&rsquo;s version before today, but definitive?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Definitive<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?  How could anyone say that?  The definitive version is, by definition, Cohen&rsquo;s.  And the only cover that matters is John Cale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->had<!-- raw HTML omitted --> heard Rufus Wainright&rsquo;s version.  In my opinion it is too respectful.  And too slow.  I like a cover version that does something new with a song, that grabs it by the throat and make&rsquo;s it the coverer&rsquo;s own.  Think of Hendrix&rsquo;s version of &lsquo;All Along the Watchtower&rsquo;, or the Clash&rsquo;s of  &lsquo;Police and Thieves&rsquo;  Or &lsquo;I Fought the Law&rsquo;, for that matter; there are those who don&rsquo;t realise that&rsquo;s a cover.  You could say that the Clashified version is - I don&rsquo;t know: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->definitive<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, maybe.</p>
<p>I maybe be in danger of self-contradiction here, but I don&rsquo;t think so: I fully accept that it&rsquo;s possible for someone to improve on the original version of a song.  I just don&rsquo;t think that anyone I&rsquo;ve heard has done that for &lsquo;Hallelujah&rsquo;.  Except <!-- raw HTML omitted -->maybe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> John Cale.</p>
<p>Having done some research into the matter (Last FM and YouTube are really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->astonishingly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cool things) Buckley&rsquo;s currently stands at second-best cover version/third-best version I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard Alexandra Burke&rsquo;s version, except for a fragment in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a BBC quiz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (7 out of 8, by the way), but I fully expect to cringe when I do.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when looking for Buckley&rsquo;s version on Last FM, I saw a comment to the effect that the version in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shrek<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is Wainright.  Well, (I thought) either Rufus has become Welsh; or they redubbed the film for the UK market; or some people can&rsquo;t tell the difference between two very different singers.  But it turns out (at least according to that same BBC quiz) that while the version in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->film<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shrek<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is Cale&rsquo;s as anyone with an ear can hear, the version on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->soundtrack album<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is Wainwright.  Strange, but doubtless to do with licensing issues.</p>
<p>I wonder if they replaced that terrible version of &lsquo;Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn&rsquo;t Have Fallen in Love With)?&rsquo; from the film with the proper version for the soundtrack album?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>The AIs that gain self-awareness and seek to achieve independence and change the world, start out as part of an educational project called the Museum of the Mind.  In this construct there are a number of simulations of figures from history (mostly fictional, like the  victorian prostitute).  School pupils, students, researchers and others can interrogate them about life in their time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that Byrne has them start to gain self-awareness after their systems get infected with a religious program: a virus that tries to &lsquo;convert&rsquo; them to Mormonism.  I don&rsquo;t know whether Byrne is trying to tell us that religion is necessary for self-awareness, or if it just seems like a useful trigger to give the programs some extra input and start them asking questions.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the erams, as they are called (electronic recreation of a mindstate) is based on an early-20th-century socialist activist.  Shocked at the apparent absence of socialism in the world he sees outside the computer networks, he organises his fellow erams, and sets out to change the world (and protect their very existence along the way).  The title stands for &ldquo;This Great Movement Of Ours&rdquo;, which was once a common phrase in speeches by Labour activists, apparently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good fun, if lightweight.  It was published in 1999; I wonder what&rsquo;s happened to Eugene Byrne since then?</p>

<p>Anyway, we finally got to the end, and, while I enjoyed it, I think that Mr Snicket has the not uncommon problem of difficulty with endings.</p>
<p>Or maybe not: he left lots (and lots, and lots) of loose ends flying.  But that might be deliberate, and isn&rsquo;t <em>necessarily</em> a bad thing.  But he seeds <em>so</em> many clues and events throughout the first twelve books that, starting the thirteenth, you wonder how he&rsquo;s going to bring them all together, and then - he just <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>.</p>
<p>Part of the narrative concerns the fact that  stories don&rsquo;t really have starts and finishes, and that a relatively inconsequential moment in your life could be the start or end of someone else&rsquo;s story, and so on. All very well, but I get the sense that he rather tacked that on to excuse the lack of an ending.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s a great story if you&rsquo;re reading to kids who love language (or if you&rsquo;re reading it yourself and do); though some, I&rsquo;m sure, would get annoyed with his repeated &ldquo;&hellip; which is a phrase which here means&hellip;&rdquo; riff, or some of his other running gags.  Me, I loved it.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the three Baudelaire orphans are engaging characters: smart, kind, wise (and noble <em>enough</em>) children, caught up in a world of sadness and madness, where almost all the adults who aren&rsquo;t out to get them are too stupid to help them.</p>
<p>Adults don&rsquo;t come out of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Series of Unfortunate Events<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at all well, in fact.  Those that aren&rsquo;t stupid are evil.  Those that are neither tend to end up  dead, or disappeared.  And everyone gets betrayed, and their hearts broken.</p>
<p>Am I telling too much, here?  Probably not: Lemony warns us, right from the blurb on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bad Beginning<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: if you&rsquo;re looking for a happy tale, there are plenty of others on the shelves.</p>
<p>While Mr Snicket tries to discourage reading these terrible books at every turn, though, they come highly recommended by me.</p>

<p>We were going to an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exhibition opening<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and had got off the bus wildly too early.  We were walking in the right direction, but weren&rsquo;t quite sure where the gallery was, and we were running late.  So we flagged down a passing cab and asked for the street.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just over there,&rdquo; he said, pointing,  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, indeed, just over there.  Admirable behaviour, I thought, as he could easily have made a few quid taking us there.</p>
<p>After we left and were walking to the bus stop, there was an altercation between a cab driver and a cyclist.  I didn&rsquo;t see how it started, but there was shouting and gesticulation, and the cabbie started to get out of his cab.</p>
<p>The cyclist headed off up the road, and suddenly the cabbie roared off after him.  It looked like nothing less than an attempt to run the cyclist down.</p>
<p>I guess the cabbie came to his senses, because I don&rsquo;t think he actually hit the guy.  The cyclist very sensibly got off the road and cycled down the pavement in the opposite direction.  The cab zoomed off up the road, to fast and  too far away for me to get its number, unfortunately.  I had my phone out ready to call the cops.</p>
<p>The cyclist seemed to be OK, physically at least.  We saw him back on the road and heading in the direction he had been going.  It&rsquo;s scary to think, though, that you could either be that cyclist, or get into that guy&rsquo;s cab.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>At Maiden Castle in Dorchester in the near future (of the time the book was written; it&rsquo;s now our near past) a scientific research project has been under way for several years.  It involves &lsquo;projection&rsquo;, in which the particpants, their bodies unconscious, enter into a shared, simulated fantasy world.  This consensus hallucination was intended to examine a possible future, with a view to suggesting answers to some of the problems of today.</p>
<p>But one of the participants has been stuck in the projection for two years (when the normal period is measured in weeks or a few months at the most); the trustees are getting worried about the costs; and a new participant is about to arrive and change everything.</p>
<p>It is <em>excellent</em>, and (of course) leaves you wondering how many levels of fantasy there are to reality - both the book&rsquo;s, and ours.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s title is an obvious allusion to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Time Machine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but this is actually much more rooted in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The War of the Worlds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  And why shouldn&rsquo;t those two novels take place in the same fictive universe?  And why shouldn&rsquo;t they be linked?  After all, Mr Wells wrote both the stories down, so he must have experienced some of the events of both, right?</p>
<p>Priest sustains the tone and style of a late-nineteenth/early-twentieth century novel admirably well, and there&rsquo;s not much to fault in this novel.</p>
<p>Except, perhaps, for the ending.  The actual climax and conclusion of the story is well expected if you know <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The War of the Worlds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It&rsquo;s just the last page or two; the rationale for the behaviour of one of the characters (a Mr Wells, in fact) in particular is, to my mind, inexplicable.  Not that it matters, that late in the story, I suppose, but it does bother me.</p>
<p>I wish I had known about this novel a few years back, when I read both <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Time Machine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Stephen Baxter&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Time Ships<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It would have sat very well in company with them.</p>

<p>But as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->others have pointed out<!-- raw HTML omitted --> he has a bad reputation on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some other rights votes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Still, there&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that he&rsquo;d be better than &ldquo;Kelvin Mc-bloody-Kenzie&rdquo;:&hellip; (as backed by Rupert Murdoch, of course).</p>
<p>The most concerning thing, though, is the talk to the effect that the public is in favour of 42-day detention without trial.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This<!-- raw HTML omitted --> member of the public most certainly is not, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m by no means alone.  And honestly: would people who&rsquo;ve really thought it through be in favour of this kind of thing?  I find it hard to believe.  What happened, if it&rsquo;s true, to the great British sense of fair play, of support for the underdog, even of disrespect for authority?  Is this another facet of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->grumbling about human rights<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I wrote about before?</p>
<p>Maybe we need to re-educate people about what is good and right.  But how?</p>
<p>And then Ireland have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->voted &lsquo;No&rsquo; to the EU treaty<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I can&rsquo;t help but think that this is a bad thing.  The EU itself has been a net good for Europe and the world, as I&rsquo;ve probably said here before.  Whether these reforms will really make it better and more democratic, or not, I can&rsquo;t say: I haven&rsquo;t studied it.</p>
<p>Thing is, though, I would probably have been in favour of the EU constitution; if only because we could do with one in the UK.  Admittedly, I&rsquo;d want one that got rid of the monarchy and introduced an elected upper chamber in parliament, but one that further enshrined the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->European Convention on Human Rights<!-- raw HTML omitted --> would be a good start.</p>
<p>It would be quite difficult to amend it, mind you, since you&rsquo;d need a Europe-wide referendum.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m havering fancifully here: it was never meant to be that kind of constitution.</p>
<p>What now, then?  Who knows, really.  I expect they&rsquo;ll either re-work it slightly and try again, or just apply various components of it without the treaty.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Though on the downside, I did find it bit hard to follow some of the plot twists and turns.  Specifically, it wasn&rsquo;t always immediately obvious to me why some of the alliances and disputes between the various factions happened.  I expect a more careful reading, or retracing of my steps, would have resolved those difficulties.  But such was the pace of the plot that I didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>I loved some of the terminology.  Travelling faster than light, for example, is called &lsquo;fittling&rsquo; (from FTL).  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">technological singularity</a>  is called the &lsquo;hard rapture&rsquo;.  I especially like that Ken has grabbed the term &lsquo;Rapture&rsquo; from the weirdo fundamentalists christians who believe Jesus is going to come back and sweep them all up to heaven.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex">Googleplex</a> (for example) becoming self-aware and sucking up everyone&rsquo;s mindstate is far more likely, if you ask me.  Which is not saying a lot about its likelihood&hellip;</p>
<p>One of the groupings of humanity that have survived through the hard rapture, and remain players on galactic stage, are called the Carlyles.  They started out as a Glasgow gang, basically.  They were based in something called &lsquo;The Castle on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Clyde">Clyde</a>&rsquo;, which I&rsquo;d like to hear more about.  Then there&rsquo;s AO: America Offline.  They didn&rsquo;t get uploaded because they weren&rsquo;t connected to the net.</p>
<p>This means that the two main dialects of the language everyone speaks are called &lsquo;American&rsquo; and &lsquo;English&rsquo;; but the &lsquo;English&rsquo; is rendered partly in Scots.  Good fun.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read any of Ken&rsquo;s stuff for a while (aside from <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/">his blog</a>, obviously). That&rsquo;s a situation I need to put right forthwith.  But first I think I should go back to the start, and dig <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Star Fraction<!-- raw HTML omitted --> out of the attic.</p>

<p>He is attacked by a &lsquo;conceptual shark&rsquo;: a living, sentient creature that is composed of ideas, of thoughts, of words; and that swims in the sea of information that surrounds us.  This is the creature that took his memories.  It eats such information, and fixates on a victim, and will keep coming back to attack them again and again.</p>
<p>So the messages from &ldquo;the first Eric Sanderson&rdquo; tell him.  Fortunately they also give him some tools and techniques to protect himself, and information about someone who might be able to help him.</p>
<p>So eventually he sets out on a quest to find the mysterious Trey Fidorous.  That&rsquo;s as far as I&rsquo;m going to go with the plot summary (it covers probably a quarter of the book).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting idea, that creatures composed of pure information, of ideas, can exist and can do us harm.  We&rsquo;re well into SF territory here, without wanting to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hegemonise<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and irrespective of the fact that it&rsquo;s marketed as mainstream literary fiction (why, I&rsquo;ve often wondered, don&rsquo;t people talk about &ldquo;li-fi&rdquo;, or &ldquo;cri-fi&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;hi-fi&rdquo;?  Why is SF so special that it gets its own disparaging abbreviation?)  There was real justification for including this work in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clarke Awards shortlist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (sadly I haven&rsquo;t read any of the others on the list).  We are plunged into a world of infinite strangeness and difference (even though it stands alongside the world we are familiar with).  We have to hang on for the ride and pick things up as we go along.  These are standard, recognised characteristics of much SF.</p>
<p>Which may be neither here nor there, really; unless how we classify a work affects how we approach it, how we read it.  And I think it&rsquo;s true that it does: if you approach Iain Banks&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bridge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for example, as SF (it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;non-M&rsquo;, so it was marketed as mainstream), then you&rsquo;ll get quite a different effect from the scenes on the bridge, and with the barbarian; at least allowing for the possibility that those events actually happened in some sense, in some reality.  As opposed to the assumption that they were &lsquo;only&rsquo; the deranged fantasy of a mind in a coma, which is of course the only &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; reading.</p>
<p>We are in a similar situation here.  Eric&rsquo;s psychiatrist thinks that he might be going into a fugue state; and clearly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has happened to his mind.  But Eric has experienced the attack of the Ludovician (the name of the particular type of conceptual fish that attacked him) and he believes throughout that what is happening is real.  And all through the quest, and the love story and the fight scenes, he believes it.  And so does the author, apparently.</p>
<p>And so do we.</p>
<p>Except.</p>
<p>Except, except.</p>
<p>Right on the second last page, Hall undermines it all.  After the narrative has finished there are a couple of pages of extra material before the &lsquo;undex&rsquo; (the point of which I&rsquo;m not sure about).</p>
<p>The first of these pulls the rug out from under us, and dumps us more or less into &ldquo;he woke up and it was all a dream&rdquo; territory.  Or didn&rsquo;t wake up.  It&rsquo;s a bit like Sam Tyler at the  end of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life on Mars<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, except there it was more or less clearly stated all the way through that he was in a coma: you just didn&rsquo;t want it to be so.</p>
<p>The present work is less honest, in a way, since there really is no suggestion that what Eric is experiencing might not be &lsquo;real&rsquo;.  Sure, it&rsquo;s always there as a possibility, but I&rsquo;d have to say,&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;, really.  Why would you bother to write a story that, in the internal logic of that story, all took place in the head of its protagonist, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and didn&rsquo;t do anything to help the protagonist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or illuminate his life, or help him to come to terms with something?</p>
<p>As such, this is ultimately disappointing: it&rsquo;s a great ride, spoiled by the ending.</p>
<p>Although, a further twist occurs to me, a couple of months after reading it.  If the rug-pulling element were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> there, you could say, then we would have a fantasy-happy ending, like the fake ending in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brazil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  That&rsquo;s never a good thing, of course, but the difference remains this: in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brazil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the false ending was tacked on (or it would have been if the &lsquo;real&rsquo; ending hadn&rsquo;t superseded it).  Here, the ending grows naturally out of all that has gone before.  If everything was in his imagination, then fine, so was the ending.  But if everything was &lsquo;really&rsquo; happening to him, then the ending is legitimate in that context, and the additional material subverts it for no good reason.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Delany writes twisty puzzle-stories, where it&rsquo;s not always clear what&rsquo;s going on, or why. I&rsquo;m a big fan of his later masterpiece, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dhalgren<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which matches that description, for example.</p>
<p>This one is more straightforward by comparison.  It is Earth&rsquo;s far future.  Humans have gone, and the world is instead inhabited by an alien race.  They have taken over, not just the planet, but humanity&rsquo;s identity, its myths, even its genetics.  And they are struggling to be human.</p>
<p>Or that, at least, is what we are told.  That is what our hero, Lo Lobey, believes, what the elders of his village have taught him.  But personally, I&rsquo;m not convinced.</p>
<p>See, there&rsquo;s nothing here that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->requires<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the characters be aliens; they behave just as humans would, in most cases.  Far-future, post-fall humans, yes, but still they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be humans.  Sure, Lobey has prehensile toes, there are various other physical differences, and there is a neuter (or hermaphrodite, it&rsquo;s not clear) &lsquo;third sex&rsquo;; but none of that is anything that a bit of genetic manipulation - deliberate, accidental, or a combination of the two - couldn&rsquo;t cause.  And there are some psychic abilities, but that is well within humanity&rsquo;s capabilities in thousands of stories, of course.</p>
<p>More importantly, they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like humans.  As Gaiman says, &ldquo;they are us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is one element that is more alien, though.  That is the curious character of Kid Death, and his (and perhaps some other characters') apparent ability to bring back the dead at will.  The latter could be illusion, of course, and would then be in keeping with the psychic powers I mentioned above.</p>
<p>Why does this matter, you might ask?  Why do I care whether these people are aliens or advanced-and-fallen humans?  In one sense it doesn&rsquo;t matter, of course.  You can enjoy the story while taking the explanation for its background at face value.  But there is, to me, something unsatisfying about the &ldquo;aliens who have taken on the characteristics of humans&rdquo; explanation.  It is too <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unexplained<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Not that we can or should expect everything to be explained in SF (or not at first, at least); and in Delany&rsquo;s work this low expectation is perhaps lower than in most.  Certainly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dhalgren<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for example, gives few clues as to what is going on, or how things have got to where they are (it occurs to me, in fact, that it could be set in the same world as the present story).</p>
<p>To have a story about such an alien race, with no examination of what they were like before they took on the role of humanity, or why they did it, seems a curious choice.  But I suppose we could see it as a demonstration of true alienness: there is no explanation of why they behave as they do because we simply <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> understand their rationale.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the explanation I like best.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand (never have) the mentality, the mindset, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->brains<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->floating voters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I&rsquo;m not saying that no-one should ever change their mind, in politics or anything else; nor do I think that people can&rsquo;t be convinced by the arguments over issues - nor, for that matter, swayed by the force of a candidate&rsquo;s personality.  Furthermore, I speak as one who has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->voted <!-- raw HTML omitted -->against<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Labour, my lifetime-favoured party, in recent years.</p>
<p>But floating voters - and in particular ones who&rsquo;ll switch all the way between Labour and Tory - I just don&rsquo;t understand them.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s possible - even likely - that no-one actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->describes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> themself as a floating voter.  They might all say, &ldquo;I decide on the issues each time,&rdquo; or even, &ldquo;&hellip; by who I like&hellip;&rdquo;  That would be OK, y&rsquo;know?  I could get behind that, sort of.  I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t sound very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->committed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; but it could be.  On each occasion you could examine the candidates' and/or their parties' positions on human rights/the environment/tax cuts/hanging and flogging (or whatever your particular concerns may be).  Match them against your own position and preferences, and see who suits you best.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not convinced that&rsquo;s what the bulk of these &lsquo;floaters&rsquo; do.</p>
<p>See, I suspect that they mostly take little to no interest in politics (which is to say, little to no interest in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the world<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) between elections.  Then when one does roll round they vote whatever way their stupid, dumbfuck tabloid paper tells them to.</p>
<p>Though I may be doing many people a great disservice there.  And at least they do get out and vote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that sometimes the world might be a better place if they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hardy obviously feels similarly to me: on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The News Quiz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the other night he said that floating voters who switched all the way from Labour to Tory (rather than voting, say, Green or LibDem) were like someone saying, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve always had my hair cut at the barbers in the High Street, but this time I&rsquo;m just going to set my head on fire!&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>But not with so much knowledge of his religious beliefs.  I had some sense &ndash; from reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, presumably &ndash; that he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was<!-- raw HTML omitted --> religious, at least in a vague, Church-of-Englandy sort of way; but I didn&rsquo;t expect, on picking this up, that it would have such a religious heart (or maybe &lsquo;soul&rsquo; would be more appropriate).</p>
<p>Though I&rsquo;m not sure that the Archbishop of Canterbury would quite approve &ndash; and I&rsquo;m absolutely sure the Pope would not &ndash; of the theology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fine story of a woman who can read the patterns of the world around her, a space pilot from the future (but is it &lsquo;our&rsquo; future?), a disembodied head, and four mysterious &lsquo;golden men&rsquo;, who might be angels, might be the biblical four horsemen of the apocalypse, or might be something else.  It&rsquo;s an easy read, and I recommend it.</p>
<p>But does the religion get in the way of the story?  No, not really; though it was something of a distraction at times for this atheist.  It&rsquo;s by no means preachy; indeed, you could argue that the religious interpretation of the events in the story is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mis<!-- raw HTML omitted -->interpretation.  Though since that interpretation is the author&rsquo;s, that would depend on where you stand on the whole postmodern thing about the author being irrelevant, and the reader entering into a dialogue with the text.</p>
<p>The question for me on a personal note is, would I have approached it differently - or read it at all - if I had known about the religious content before I started it?</p>
<p>The answer is, I would have approached it differently.  And, if I hadn&rsquo;t known the author&rsquo;s work, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have picked it up at all.</p>
<p>By saying that, I&rsquo;m convicting myself of being likely to prejudge religiously-inspired fiction; well, yes, guilty as charged.  Just as I&rsquo;m likely to prejudge romantic fiction, literary fiction, heroic fantasy, and so on.  We don&rsquo;t approach anything in a vacuum, after all.  Our past experiences, our expectations, colour our understanding and appreciation of any art.  And we all have our preferences.</p>
<p>Still, if I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->had<!-- raw HTML omitted --> known, and rejected this, I&rsquo;d have missed out on something worthwhile.  So that&rsquo;s worth bearing in mind.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not what gets people out to vote: a desire for change is much more likely to bring crowds to the local schools, village halls, and other little nooks and crannies of public space that experience a kind of sovereignty for a day.</p>
<p>Either way, there&rsquo;s no better or nobler duty that you can do in a few minutes in a small cubicle with a pencil and a piece of paper.</p>
<p>And if you live in London, and have a vote, please, please, <em>please</em> get out and use it <em>against</em> Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care who you vote for (well, the BNP are standing, but I&rsquo;m sure anyone reading this is much too decent and right-thinking to go there).  Though it&rsquo;s clear that only Ken has a serious chance of keeping the bumbling buffoon out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced, by the way, that the Tories put him up to it as a joke.  The thinking probably went something like, &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s going to beat Livingstone, so let&rsquo;s put comedy candidate up, and make a mockery of the whole thing.&rdquo;  Then somehow, thanks largely to the vile rag that is ??The Evening Standard??, and the lack of seriousness with which some people treat politics, Boris climbed up the polls, and now looks like a serious contender for the Mayorship.</p>
<p>It will be a disaster for London if he gets elected, of course.  We can only hope that it will backfire on the Tories: that he fails fast enough that it seriously harms them in the general election.</p>
<p>Putting your hopes for the country on disaster for your city is no position to be in, though.  So I can only reiterate: get out and vote, and stop Boris.  Give at least your <em>second</em> vote to Ken.  He has his faults, but he&rsquo;s done a pretty good job of running the city this last eight years.</p>
<p>Vote!</p>

<p>It was his first convention, and I think he quite enjoyed it; though the next time we&rsquo;ll need to ensure that there are some other kids there who like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yu-Gi-Oh! (mental trading card game beloved of ten-year-old boys)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I saw some old friends and had a fine time.  I was very restrained in comparison with my old conventioneering days.  Early(ish) nights, the lot.  It was quite refreshing to come home on the Monday and not feel at all rough.</p>
<p>The guests of honour were great, those of them that I saw, at least.  I missed &ldquo;Charlie Stross&rsquo;s&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/index.html">www.antipope.org/charlie/b&hellip;</a> speech because of being away for a while, but he was by far the most visible of them all around  the con.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->China Miéville<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gave a great speech about how it doesn&rsquo;t spoil stories to read more into them than the author consciously intended; or than our interlocutor might say we should (you know, the kind who say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re reading too much into it!  It&rsquo;s just a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->story<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!&quot;).</p>
<p>And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neil Gaiman (the net&rsquo;s no. 1 Neil)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was lovely.  He read a short story, and talked for a bit, and then read the start of his new novel <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Graveyard Book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Later on, he did a kids-only reading of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wolves in the Walls<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The best part of that was that parents and carers were allowed in too.  He really knows how to handle an audience; even one of the most demanding kind, such as this.</p>
<p>And my boy got his books signed without having to join the apparently-mad queues for the official signing sessions.</p>
<p>Then there was a performance of my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Andrew&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> play, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Terminal Zone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I wrote about when I read the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->chapbook<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, It&rsquo;s a fine work.  This particular performance could have done with more rehearsal, but of course, these are amateurs, fitting it all into the rest of their lives, and doing a damn fine job.</p>
<p>That was followed by a live set from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mitch Benn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who I&rsquo;ve been a fan of for some time from his performances on Radio 4&rsquo;s  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Now Show<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and live, he was absolutely fantastic, especially, I think, since the audience got all his SF references (you don&rsquo;t say) without any prompting.</p>
<p>All in all, a great weekend, in a fine hotel (pity it&rsquo;s lost its swimming pool, though).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>My thanks to his publishers, Tor, then, for making his debut available via their free ebooks programme.  I read most of it on the Eee PC, with some bits on my phone (when I was standing up on the  tube).</p>
<p>In short, I loved it; though I have some doubts, or reservations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a curious universe (or at least, galaxy) that he describes: it is <em>teeming</em> with life, intelligent life; but nearly all of it is antithetical to nearly all of the rest of it.  Certainly, it is a book about war (the clue&rsquo;s in the title); but it&rsquo;s not one war between humanity and another alien race.  Instead it&rsquo;s a series of small wars to defend human colonies from alien attackers, and to attack alien colonies and capture the planets for humans.  And once our hero joins up, he is <em>constantly</em> at war; there is no respite, at least that we hear of.</p>
<p>And only one, minor, character questions this state of affairs (though others do express their doubts).</p>
<p>I have a feeling, though, that these questions may be addressed in the sequels, which I&rsquo;m keen to read (more proof, were it needed, that giving things away can be a good thing for authors and publishers alike).</p>
<p>The &lsquo;old-man&rsquo;s&rsquo; bit is that you can only join up when you reach 75 years of age.  You relinquish your Earth-nation&rsquo;s citizenship and are legally considered dead.  Members of the Colonial Defense Force can <em>never</em> return to Earth.</p>
<p>But to make up for that, you get a new youthful body, and (if you make it through your tour of duty) the opportunity to have a new life on a colony planet.  The Colonial powers being technologically far in advance of Earth (which has become a bit of a backwater), there is not similar life-extension technology available to those on Earth.</p>
<p>So you can see the temptation.  Peaceful soul that I am, I can imagine that I might take up the offer.  Life is better than the alternative, you know?</p>

<p>It continues the story of Miriam Beckstein and her recently-discovered alternative-universe family of &lsquo;world-walkers&rsquo;.  In this one, Miriam discovers that (not surprisingly) there is more than one alternative Earth, and takes advantage of that fact.</p>
<p>Two things bother me about all this, though. One is that at no point, it seems, does she or anyone else do any investigation into the world-walking ability, or the designs of the talismans that make it work.  Though I have reason to believe that that point gets addressed in a later book.</p>
<p>The other problem I have is just how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->capable<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Miriam is.  She&rsquo;s a can-do hero in the Heinlein &ndash; even in the Doc Smith &ndash; mold.  Which is all very well, and all kudos to Charlie for making such a figure a woman, rather than the ubiquitous men created by those illustrious earlier writers.  But those characters were never very believable, and we live in more sophisticated times now, do we not?  So it&rsquo;s hard to believe in someone relatively ordinary who finds themself in another universe, and who just copes.  Indeed, not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just<!-- raw HTML omitted --> copes, but prospers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve said elsewhere that we don&rsquo;t read SF for the characters, but for the stories (and the ideas, of course).  And this is a great story that I sat up late to finish.  And you can&rsquo;t argue with that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>The application works like this.  You can name up to six &ldquo;preferences&rdquo; (not &ldquo;choices&rdquo;, note).  A central (London-wide, but I&rsquo;m not sure under what body &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think the GLA handles education) body assesses your application against the entry conditions of your first preference.  If you meet those conditions, you get a place in that school; if not, they go on to your second preference; if you meet that school&rsquo;s conditions, you get a place there, and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite as simple as that, of course, because schools' entry conditions don&rsquo;t just apply to your child in isolation; they have to take account of how many people are applying, and how many of those fall into each of the entry conditions, and so on.  As well as that, not only do different boroughs have different conditions, but so do different schools within a borough.</p>
<p>The entry conditions of most state schools, including the new academies, depend primarily on distance from the school.  There are special conditions for children with special needs, but that&rsquo;s a small minority.</p>
<p>Now, all of this raises a number of problems &ndash; or contributes to them, at least.</p>
<p>First is the fact that different schools have different entry conditions.  This applies in particular to the new academies.  Our closest, non-denominational, mixed-gender, state secondary, is Mossbourne, the much-cited flagship of the government&rsquo;s new academies programme.  We live about 900 metres from it, according to Google Maps.  Close enough, you&rsquo;d think.  But their admissions policy goes something like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Confused?  Most parents who have kids going up were.  And it&rsquo;s further complicated by the fact that there&rsquo;s a test.  Not a pass -or-fail test, of course: this is still a comprehensive school, so there&rsquo;s no selection by ability allowed.  Rather, this test is used to split the kids into ability bands.  The entry conditions then ensure that an equal proportion of kids from each band is offered a place.  This is to ensure that the school  has kids of a range of abilities; to ensure that it is truly comprehensive, if you will.</p>
<p>None of that is inherently bad: a school can&rsquo;t take every kid, if more want in than it has places, so it has to have some conditions by which to decide which ones to take.  And ensuring that you take on kids with the full range of abilities is egalitarian and in keeping with the comprehensive principle.</p>
<p>The problem comes when the school is oversubscribed, and so is the next one in the area, and the next; and when <em>they all have different entry criteria</em>.</p>
<p>Such is the situation in our corner of Hackney.  Well, across Hackney as a whole, but we happen to be in one of the more problematic corners, since we&rsquo;re right at the edge of the borough.  That wouldn&rsquo;t matter if the Hackney schools gave priority to Hackney kids, but they don&rsquo;t: their distance criteria are based on pure straight-line measurements, ignoring borough boundaries.</p>
<p>Again, <em>that</em> wouldn&rsquo;t matter so much if all the other boroughs did the same.  But they don&rsquo;t.  Our neighbours Tower Hamlets, for example, not only give priority to Tower Hamlets residents, they also have tied primary schools.  If your kid goes to one of these, then they are <em>guaranteed</em> a place in the associated secondary school, if they (you) want it.</p>
<p>But this is not intended to be a big bowl of sour grapes.  Our boy almost certainly won&rsquo;t get into any of the Hackney schools, but he should get into the next-nearest one, which is just over the border into Waltham Forest.  And all of this may be moot, anyway.  But more of that later.</p>
<p>I referred in my title to &ldquo;the myth of choice&rdquo;, and I was careful to stress above that the application process allows parents and children to specify their <em>preferences</em>, rather than choices.  That&rsquo;s because of what happens next, after the application process has come up with a school for your kid.</p>
<p>You get an offer.  One offer.  That&rsquo;s it.  (Or maybe none, in which you have to run around frantically making further applications.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it was when I applied to university (and probably still is for university applications today).  There, you could apply to five (or was it six?) institutions using the UCCA (now UCAS) form.  They all assessed your application, and up to <em>all</em> of them made you an offer.  You could then choose among your offers and decide  which place would suit you best.</p>
<p>That was choice.  For secondary schools. despite what the government might tell you, there is no choice.  All you can do is state your preferences.</p>
<p>Our particular dilemma had another wrinkle, though.</p>
<p>See, he and some of his friends decided that they wanted to go to something called The Latymer School, in Edmonton.  I was surprised when I found out that this is a grammar school.  Now, some years ago I was surprised to discover that these things still exist in England.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that when the comprehensive system started in Scotland, it was done properly: we got rid of <em>all</em> the grammar schools and Secondary Moderns, as far as I understand it.  So as I say, it was a surprise when I realised they still had some in England.</p>
<p>But even then, I thought they were restricted to Kent and a few other places.  I had no idea there were any in London.</p>
<p>Still, there we were.  We weren&rsquo;t about to forbid him to look at a particular school, despite our natural left-wing reaction to the idea of a selective school.  Perhaps of more concern is that he would be going out of the borough, with both a long journey to get there, and a less ethnically diverse mix than he&rsquo;s used to from primary.</p>
<p>When it came time to stating our preferences, we let him have the final word.  Which is a lot of weight to put on the shoulders of a ten-year-old, perhaps, but it&rsquo;s better than pressuring him into going somewhere he&rsquo;d rather not go, and driving him away from us.</p>
<p>One thing I can say: selection by ability is obviously better than selection by ability to pay.</p>
<p>And another: we&rsquo;ll be incredibly proud of him wherever he goes.</p>
<p>He got through the first battery of tests, and took the second; and we&rsquo;ve been waiting since then.  And tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll know.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; certainly not badly written (though he does overuse the phrases &ldquo;appeared to be&rdquo;, and &ldquo;looked like&rdquo;, when describing things; I was told off years ago (by Lisa Tuttle, no less) for  using &ldquo;seemed&rdquo; when describing something: &ldquo;it either is, or it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;ve been painfully aware of that word, and phrases that take its place, ever since).  It&rsquo;s just not as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as we&rsquo;ve come to expect, which is  a disappointment.</p>
<p>The main fault is that he describes too much of the scenery, to the point where it all starts to get a bit much.  He didn&rsquo;t always do that, I don&rsquo;t think.  Or maybe he did, but it was better executed, and so not so noticeable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the tale of some of the inhabitants of a level on a ShellWorld, and how they come into contact with The Culture, and why, and what follows.  All good stuff, with plenty of fabulous tech.</p>
<p>But you know what was the most annoying thing about it?  The cover.  It shows a human figure in silhouette, walking away from (or it could be toward) our PoV.  On the horizon a city is burning.  Overhead there are stars.  It&rsquo;s not annoying because no scene remotely like it happens in the book (well, there is one scene a bit like it, but she isn&rsquo;t on foot).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s annoying because of the shadows.</p>
<p>The figure&rsquo;s shadow shoots out to its left, implying that there&rsquo;s a strong light source to the right; a rising or setting star.  But the burning city is giving off  lot of light, too.  Enough, it seems to me, that she (if it is a she) should have a secondary shadow, also to her left, but coming towards our PoV.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small thing, I know, and I don&rsquo;t usually comment on the covers of books, but I noticed it when I was about two-thirds of the way through, and it bugged me every time I looked at it thereafter.</p>
<p>Still, you know what they say about books and covers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Both the plugin and the theme are supposed to make WordPress be usable a bit like <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>.  There are a number of flaws, though.

I&rsquo;m all for a clean, simple look, but this might have gone too far.</p>
<p>And the plugin doesn&rsquo;t allow for a preview before posting (as well as not working properly with Flickr, though presumably that will be fixed in due course).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: No, that won&rsquo;t do at all.  One or other of them disabled comments and lost the title (even though &ldquo;Allow Comments&rdquo; is ticked, and the title appears, in the main editor.</p>
<p>I suppose the thinking is that, for something quick and dirty you don&rsquo;t want comments or titles, but I do.  Even <a href="http://devilgate.tumblr.com/">Tumblr has titles</a>, if not comments.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edit 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Well, a bit of CSS hacking sorted that out.  But posting photos isn&rsquo;t working at all as I would expect.  That may be to do with the fact that I&rsquo;ve never really dealt with posting images before, though, rather than the plugin or theme.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>The subject being discussed was the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->call to ban<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this &ldquo;Mosquito&rdquo; device, which is intended to stop kids and teenagers from hanging around shops or elsewhere by emitting an annoying noise which is too high for older ears to hear.  But it could as easily have been the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bugging of prisoner-lawyer conversations<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or one of a dozen other triggers for what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave Hill<!-- raw HTML omitted --> calls the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->seething classes<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, people: human rights are a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good thing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quite believe I&rsquo;m having to write that.  Again: human rights, and governments upholding them, are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  An unequivocal good.  There&rsquo;s no question here; we&rsquo;re not in any kind of moral grey area.  Some things are as stark and as plain as the type and the paper on some of the entities I&rsquo;m about to blame: treating people with equality before the law, with respect; acknowledging a basic set of rights to which every human being is entitled, and striving to make those rights available to everyone: these things are an unequivocal good.</p>
<p>Let me spell this out in words of one syllable:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That&rsquo;s what our parents and grandparents fought the fucking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->war<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>OK, went a bit over my syllable count there.</p>
<p>It is just a few  years since the incoming Labour government passed the Human Rights Act, incorporating into UK law the European Convention on Human Rights; how has our country got to the position, since then, that &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; has become a swear word?</p>
<p>I blame the tabloids.  Specifically, I blame the right-wing, ranting, seething, whinging rags of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daily Mail<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the Murdoch-owned scumsheets.  I blame big business and the CBI; I blame the petty little-Englander mentality of a disturbingly vocal minority of the citizens of our great, multicultural nation.</p>
<p>What is to be done about it?  How do we regain the natural state of the British psyche, where we stick up for the underdog, as well as have a respect for natural justice?  Or, if not  regain it (since it hasn&rsquo;t really gone anywhere) at least make its voice audible again?  How are we to make the complainers tone down, or better, teach them, show them, that human rights are for  everybody (even the complainers), not just for the tiny minorities whose stories get wildly inflated in the tabloids; and that even those tiny minorities (where they actually exist) deserve the protection of those rights; and perhaps above all, that our society, our nation, is enriched and improved by our granting and acknowledging those rights?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>This one isn&rsquo;t SF, of course.  Instead, it&rsquo;s described as a &ldquo;comic novel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have to say that I found very little in it to laugh at.</p>
<p>Oh, the odd chortle, or wry grin, certainly; in particular there is a description of a hangover that has been quoted often enough that I recognised it in its entirety.</p>
<p>But our national sense of humour must have changed since 1954, or something.  Not to mention a great deal more about our society and the way we interact.  At times in this novel I found it harder to understand the motivations of the characters than of the  most alien of characters in SF (well, ok, not to the extent of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lsquo;The Dance of the Changer and the Three&rsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, say, but anything less than that).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no bad thing, but since it wasn&rsquo;t the intent of the author, that sense of confusion or dislocation can leave you feeling lost.  This is quite different from the effect you can get in good SF, where you&rsquo;re thrown in at the deep end, not quite knowing what&rsquo;s going on.  There, you just hang on and enjoy the ride, trusting in the knowledge that it&rsquo;ll become clear in time.</p>
<p>In this case there&rsquo;s no hope of an explanation, because Amis didn&rsquo;t realise that the behaviour of his sexually stilted 1950s academics would be quite so opaque and mysterious to a reader in the zero-years of the 21st century (why didn&rsquo;t they just go to bed, already?)</p>
<p>Still, as a gentle rom-com, it wasn&rsquo;t too bad.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>(What, you think that&rsquo;s a spoiler?  You saw the future world when Sylar had healing powers: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->obviously<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that one wasn&rsquo;t going to come true).</p>
<p>You know, some things shouldn&rsquo;t have a second series.  They are perfect bite-sized little vignettes as they are (OK, pretty big bites, and not so much of the &ldquo;ette&rdquo;, in this case).  Their story is told, and while it may not have a tidy conclusion to every thread, it has at least reached a satisfying point at which to stop; there are no downright cliffhangers left.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like life: there are no beginnings, no endings; not really.  Only a continuing narrative that we pay more or less attention to; and that we eventually have to stop reading (or writing), and put away forever (which last fact is intensely annoying, and the sooner we can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->edit it out of our reality<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the better).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heroes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is over; but in a way I&rsquo;m sadder that it&rsquo;s going to go on.  Because there will be inevitable deterioration &ndash; I read recently that Tim Kring has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->apologised about the quality<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of some Season 2 eps (oh, there are a few mild spoilers for Season 2 at that link; or not so mild, depending on how you feel about them) &ndash; there will be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shark-jumping<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  And eventually it may fall to the lowest common denominator of all serial drama: soap opera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Desperate Housewives<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And things that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->should<!-- raw HTML omitted --> go on, that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->need<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to go on, don&rsquo;t get to.  One of these days &ndash; and it must be soon, I think &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is going to finish, and then it&rsquo;ll be gone forever, irrespective of what plot threads are dangling.  Bummer.</p>

And while that&rsquo;s kind of insulting (and not even true for  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Un Lun Dun<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), there is some truth in it.

<p>But the weirdness to my mind is that on The Trainline&rsquo;s website, you have to select specific trains when you&rsquo;re booking (even if the ticket you are buying is flexible enough that you can travel on a different service in the end).  So you&rsquo;re always &ldquo;booking&rdquo; a particular train; but not, automatically, booking a seat.  What, exactly, does it mean to do that?</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s assume that all seats on the train are full when you get on, as they usually are on routes like London to Glasgow; is there a particular circle of floor space that is yours?  You have a booking on that service, after all: it must mean <!-- raw HTML omitted -->something<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I recall, years ago, when I used to travel up and down these lines a lot, that there were a lot of services, especially at weekend peak times, on which seat bookings were &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo;.  There were still people without bookings who got on and crammed in between the carriages, so I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what that meant, either.  But at least it meant that when you booked a ticket (at a station or a travel agent: no web in those days), you also booked a seat.</p>
<p>And having booked it, you nearly always got it; British Rail had its problems, but incompatible systems between the booking agents and the different train operating companies wasn&rsquo;t one of them, as it seems to be now.  The Trainline&rsquo;s other strangeness was that, after phoning to add the seat bookings, I was sent the details for the outgoing service (on Virgin Trains), but not those for the return (on GNER).  When that happened on the first of those trips, I assumed it was a mistake, so I mentioned it when I phoned for the second one.  I was told that it was unavoidable because GNER use a different system, and they (The Trainline) were only able to book on paper (and then, what, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the details to GNER?)</p>
<p>I blame the Tories, of course: privatisation was always an appalling idea.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Flying north we had standard velour-covered (or whatever you&rsquo;d call it: fuzzy cloth) seats, and standard seat-back pockets  made of criss-crossed bungee cord.</p>
<p>But southbound we had nasty vinyl-covered seats.  Vinyl!  Who&rsquo;d have thought you could still cover seats in such a thing?  It looked like the inside of a 1970s Vauxhall Viva!</p>
<p>Worse than that, though: there were no seat-back pockets at all!  None!</p>
<p>This arrangement means that the little bits and pieces you want to have to hand &ndash; bottle of water, MP3 player, book or magazine, notebook &ndash; all have to go on the floor under the seat in front when you&rsquo;re not holding them.</p>
<p>As well as being inconvenient, those things on the floor all now constitute an added safety risk: if there was some kind of problem before takeoff or after landing, they&rsquo;d all be sliding about, just perfect for people to trip over or slip on.</p>
<p>So, reduced comfort, convenience <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> safety.  Nice one, RyanAir.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I watched <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bridge to Terabithia<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> last weekend.  It is probably the saddest film I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and despite <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plaudits<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it has received, it has at its core, I think, a heart of darkness.  It is not a bad film, but it has a dark soul.</p>
<p>I came to the film cold.  I&rsquo;ve not read the book; indeed, I&rsquo;d never even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->heard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of it when the film came out.  The book is described in terms of being &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->much-loved<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; and a &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->classic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;.  It was published in 1977, when I was 12 or 13.  So I expect I missed it because I was &lsquo;too old&rsquo; for children&rsquo;s books, and not yet old enough again for them.  And I had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other concerns<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in that year.</p>
<p>So all I knew about it was the &lsquo;from the creators of Narnia&rsquo; tag line, a quick read of the blurb, and the fact that my daughter (6) was interested in it.</p>
<p>As the early scenes unfolded I realised that that I had read a review of it, though.  All that I recalled was a complaint to the effect that in the book, the girl was supposed to be plain, even boyish-looking, while in the film she was Hollywood-pretty (if dressed a little unconventionally compared to her schoolmates).</p>
<p>I think that review explains why my opinion of the film differs so significantly from that of most reviewers: they all seem to have read the book.  Inevitably they review the film in comparison to it, and fuelled by their knowledge of the plot.</p>
<p>So they can describe it as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lsquo;bittersweet&rsquo;, as having an &lsquo;uplifting&rsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ending; even as &lsquo;transcendent&rsquo; (I think that last came from one of the mini-documentaries on the DVD).  Because as they watched, they knew what was coming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often thought that some films &ndash; the later <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Harry Potter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ones are particular examples &ndash; must be all but incoherent to anyone who hasn&rsquo;t first read the book on which they are based.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Potters<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can get away with it, because so many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> read the books first.  But in general a film &ndash; or any adaptation from one medium to another &ndash; must work on its own.  It is a separate, new creation, and has to stand or fall as such.</p>
<p>In one sense at least, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Terabithia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fails on this account.</p>
<p>The trouble is not lack of coherence; rather it is excess of impact, and lack of recovery time.  There is certainly some foreshadowing: it is plain that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bad is going to happen.  But the  tragedy when it comes &ndash; and make no mistake, the story <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a tragedy &ndash; is too deep, too dark, too sudden.  Yes, true, that&rsquo;s how it would be in real life; and I&rsquo;m not suggesting that movie viewers, including children, should be completely protected from darkness, tragedy or loss.  But here, suddenly, shatteringly, we are no longer watching the film that we thought we were.</p>
<p>Which is not necessarily a bad thing.  But the film&rsquo;s fatal flaw &ndash; or at least the cause of its failure to achieve the uplift suggested by reviewers &ndash; comes after the plunge into darkness.</p>
<p>It is the lack of recovery time, and the content of what time there is.  Yes, a significant amount of time for the characters is compressed into a few swiftly-edited scenes.  Perhaps enough time is represented for the boy, Jess, to come to terms with his loss, or at least to begin to do so.  But it is not enough time for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do so.</p>
<p>And perhaps because the fantasy elements were (rightly) understated earlier on, we have what feels like a tacked-on fantasy ending.  And it&rsquo;s not even the tacked-on fantasy ending we might want.  Me, I&rsquo;d have liked Jess, the talented artist, to to have ripped out the page of the film&rsquo;s continuity, said, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and sketched a new one.</p>
<p>That, of course, would have made for a saccharine ending, like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->false ending<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brazil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or the original cut of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blade Runner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It would have been deemed a mistake (not least because of differing from the book), or at least have been very hard to make work.  It would have betrayed the story.</p>
<p>But the ending that we do have betrays the story too, I think, in a different way.  The descent (ascent?) into fantasy may show that Jess had become closer to his little sister; but it writes Leslie out of his memories of Terabithia.  It ceases to be their magical place, and therefore fails to honour her memory.</p>
<p>Of course it is all to help him to come to terms with his loss; but as his Dad tells him, it&rsquo;s by remembering what was special about her that he can keep her alive.</p>
<p>Above all, though, it all happens too quickly: maybe we, the viewers, could have had just a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->little<!-- raw HTML omitted --> more time?</p>
<p>I can only assume that the book does, in fact, provide a more gentle exit for its readers, for it to be so popular.  Though of course, you can take a book at your own pace.</p>
<p>Yet despite &ndash; or more likely, because of &ndash; all of the above, it&rsquo;s a film that will stay with me for a long time; that I&rsquo;ll probably watch again; and whose source-book I&rsquo;ll certainly seek out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Seeing them live after all this time would be particularly fine, as I know them best through their second and final album, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mission Accomplished&hellip; But The Beat Goes On<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is a live album.</p>
<p>It was recorded at the Glasgow Apollo, which is now, sadly, long-demolished.  But before all that, it was where I went to my first couple of gigs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really do all the recent wave of reforming bands (I didn&rsquo;t even go to see the Velvet Underground when they reformed, which I regret (but I&rsquo;d been burned by one of Lou&rsquo;s solo performances)), but I think I might make an exception in this case.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;ve just remembered that we&rsquo;re invited to a party that night, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> there are two other gigs on that evening that I&rsquo;d like to go to (Patti Smith and Richard Thompson).  Damn.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the quality of Banksie&rsquo;s non-SF work rose in shallow, slightly wiggly, climb from a high start, to a &ldquo;can do no wrong&rdquo; plateau that includes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bridge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Espedair Street<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Complicity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as well as the aforementioned.  Thereafter it dropped a bit (but who can blame him, after that lot?)  But it never got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  (His SF took a different trajectory, and as far as I can tell, it&rsquo;s still climbing.)</p>
<p>So what of this book?  It&rsquo;s a family drama, I suppose you&rsquo;d say, with a mystery at its heart.  Not a &ldquo;whodunit&rdquo;, so much as &ldquo;what got done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slipping into Banksie&rsquo;s world is like pulling on an old, comfy jumper; or maybe a favourite leather jacket would be more appropriate.  So we get recognisable characters, dialogue that you could hear in any pub or home in Scotland, and just a touch of mystery.</p>
<p>The main problem, perhaps, is that there&rsquo;s no great threat over the characters (they might decide to sell the family games business to a big American company, and some of them are against that happening).  So we don&rsquo;t have any real sense of potential doom.  Still, though, finding the answer to the mystery is fun enough, and it&rsquo;s a compelling enough read that I got through it in a couple of days.</p>
<p>In a book like this, the pleasure is in the journey more than the destination.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I must admit that, if you had asked me a few days ago, I would probably have said that I thought that the Bank of England <!-- raw HTML omitted -->already<!-- raw HTML omitted --> backed the banks to the extent of protecting people&rsquo;s deposits.  Naive of me, perhaps; but after the Bank extended its line of credit to Northern Rock, and particularly since last night&rsquo;s guarantee by the Chancellor, that their money will be covered by the government, it&rsquo;s clear to an uninvolved bystander that they&rsquo;d be better off staying at home and waiting.  If the government can&rsquo;t cover anything that might happen to NR, then we&rsquo;ve got a much more serious problem than one wobbly bank on our hands.</p>
<p>Like the collapse of the pound.</p>
<p>And it would take the euro down with it; and probably the US dollar, and hence the world economy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an economist, and you can call me complacent; but that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>So leave the queues, people, and go on home (if you&rsquo;ve got that much in savings, you obviously don&rsquo;t have to go to work).  And next time, remember that proverb about eggs and baskets.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>But I gather that there is a whole generation of twenty-somethings &ndash; maybe even thirty-somethings &ndash; who went to see the movie with a sense of worry, even trepidation, that it would stamp a great big metal foot all over their memories.  And I gather that, largely, for them, it did not.  I had heard quite good things about it (or I thought I had); and the trailer looked great.</p>
<p>So I was mostly disappointed.  I didn&rsquo;t hate it all the way through; nothing as extreme as that.  I was just disappointed at how weak and overlong it was; and mainly by the American-military porn.  A great deal of it was showing the fantasticness and coolness of American military technology.  I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s really what I want to see in a film I take my kids to (though as it also revealed that all human technology came from reverse-engineering the frozen Megatron, they may have been sending mixed signals).</p>
<p>Also, since it starts with a US military base in the Middle East being attacked (by a giant alien fighting robot, and in Qatar, admittedly, but still), you might reasonably expect there to be some political point.  But there wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Unless, perhaps, it was this.  The grunts (actually Special Forces, so I&rsquo;m not sure we should call them grunts) were shown as cool, professional, skillful and competent.  The secret government agency in charge of crashed alien artifacts, and the FBI, were shown as feeble, useless and pathetic; easily outwitted by a couple of teenagers and, err, a group of giant alien fighting robots.  So, soldiers good, government bad, or something.</p>
<p>Also, one bit that really surprised me was when Megatron and Optimus Prime were fighting: Megatron turned into a plane, Optimus Prime grabbed him, and together they crashed into the side of a tower block and slo-mo&rsquo;d all the way through it and out the other side.  9/11 can&rsquo;t be as raw a wound in the American psyche as I had thought.</p>
<p>We could have done without the whole teen romance thing, but it&rsquo;s an American summer blockbuster, so what can you expect?  And we could have done without at least half an hour of the start.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also incredibly visually noisy, and the Transformers themselves, especially the Decepticons (the baddies) are so similar when they&rsquo;re in robot mode that it was really hard to tell what was going on at times.</p>
<p>But then, what was going on didn&rsquo;t really matter that much.</p>
<p>The kids enjoyed it though, and it was a nice treat to end the summer holidays with; but since we started them with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and middled them with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Simpsons<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I don&rsquo;t think it really stands up.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s definitely been &lsquo;The Summer of Film&rsquo;, as they were calling it in the trailers a while back.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>On the Saturday there was a picnic-party for some friends who are leaving Hackney, as well as much packing of the car. Then at stupid o&rsquo;clock on the Sunday morning we headed off to Dover for a ferry to France, and two weeks camping in Brittany. My son finished the book on the journey; about 37 hours after its release. I took a couple of days more, and then read it again straight away. Which is something that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever done before. This is not necessarily because it was so great, but more because I read it so fast the first time. Rowling is a great plotter, so sometimes the pages turn too fast.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ll be honest, I kind of didn&rsquo;t want it all to be over.</p>
<p>The holiday was great. Mixed weather, of course, but no worse than here, I think</p>
<p>Then after a week back at work I find myself hitting an important anniversary: Today I&rsquo;ve have been in this job for twenty years. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twenty years!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It&rsquo;s hard to credit. I feel like a poster boy for the phrase, &ldquo;Where did the time go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only is it the same job, it&rsquo;s my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first<!-- raw HTML omitted --> job. The company name has changed several times due to takeovers, but it&rsquo;s the same place, and quite a lot of the same people. It&rsquo;s been good, on the whole, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have stayed. But I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder whether it might be time for a change.</p>
<p>Tonight, though, I&rsquo;ll be in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the pub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. On the roof terrace, if the weather holds.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>When I was a few pages in I was getting a strong sense of this absence of a voice: the husband was not to be heard. But then I thought two things. First, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> epistolary novels are like that to some extent; though it is possible for the letter-writer to refer to things their correspondent has written in return.</p>
<p>Second, it occurred to me that Shriver, by excluding the man&rsquo;s voice, might have been making a point about the relative exclusion of women&rsquo;s voices in literature. In other words, the way I was feeling might be akin to how Jean Rhys <!-- raw HTML omitted -->must have felt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when she read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jane Eyre<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>And none if it can make up for the fact that he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>In fact, reading the book only makes it worse: it reinforces the sense of what we&rsquo;ve lost. He was on a great creative upswing when he died, as the the posthumous <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Streetcore<!-- raw HTML omitted --> album showed. Its opening track, &lsquo;Coma Girl&rsquo; (which, we learn, is about his daughter Lola) was the single best song he wrote since &lsquo;Trash City&rsquo;, at least.</p>
<p>Alas, we&rsquo;ll never hear anything new from him again.</p>
<p>Or at least, not truly new: it seems from reading the book that there might be quite a few unreleased recordings out there, and he worked on more film soundtracks than I knew about.</p>
<p>Most interestingly of all, perhaps, is this piece of information. Around the time that Joe and the Mescaleros were writing and recording <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Global A Go-Go<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the second of the comeback albums after the wilderness years, he also sent a set of lyrics to Mick Jones. He seemed to be suggesting that he was considering an alternative to the Mescaleros album. Mick wrote tunes for them and sent them back, but heard no more about it. Some time later, after <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Global A Go-Go<!-- raw HTML omitted --> had been released, Mick asked what had happened to the songs. Joe said, &ldquo;Those weren&rsquo;t for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Global A Go-Go<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; those were the next Clash album.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no suggestion that he ever recorded any of them; but you never know: one day Mick might, when he&rsquo;s not too busy with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Carbon/Silicon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>What of the book itself, though? Well, it&rsquo;s certainly compelling reading (at least if you&rsquo;re a fan like me). It is flawed in some ways, of course. It can be hard to follow the early sections about Joe&rsquo;s family, without an actual family tree to clarify things, thought that&rsquo;s not a big problem.</p>
<p>Despite its size and comprehensive nature, there are parts that come across as too anecdotal and perhaps incomplete. Certainly there are places where I would have liked to have a lot more detail. But a book this size could be written about The Clash alone (several have, of course, but perhaps none quite the size of this one).</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s totally a must-have for any Clash fan, or solo Joe fan (can you be the latter but not the former?)</p>
<p>I wonder what it would have been like if The Clash had kept going and had become like U2 (who were heavily inspired by them)? In a good sense: I listened to an interview with Salewicz, where he pointed out that, though Joe didn&rsquo;t like the distance from the audience at stadium gigs, he was very good at handling them. So imagine them doing something like the Zoo TV tour (indeed, when I saw footage of that, all the TVs as backdrop reminded me instantly of the Clash Mk II &lsquo;Out of Control&rsquo; tour).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>My friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Andrew<!-- raw HTML omitted --> wrote this play back in 1993 or so, and produced it at the Edinburgh Fringe. It has now been published as a chapbook by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Writers' Bloc<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the spoken-word performance group that grew out of the East Coast SF Writers' group.</p>
<p>In it, Rod Serling, the writer and presenter of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Twilight Zone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, appears; or rather, two sides of his personality appear, performed by two actors, and indulge in a dialogue. This is the story, you might say, of Rod Serling talking to himself.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A collection of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Love and Rockets<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stories by Jaime. I haven&rsquo;t read any of these for years, but all our favourites are here: Maggie and Hopey, of course, and Penny Century, and HR Costigan, whose story reaches a conclusion of sorts.</p>
<p>His storytelling technique can make it hard sometimes, to tell where we are chronologically: he&rsquo;ll tell the history of years in a character&rsquo;s life in the space of half a dozen or a dozen panels, with nothing other than the pictures and dialogue to indicate that the time has changed. And yet somehow you can work out what is happening, and over what period.</p>
<p>The artwork is gorgeous in its simplicity, of course, and he always has moving stories to tell.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This graphic novel was published in weekly installments in the Saturday issue of <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> over a year or so. Actually, most weeks there were two episodes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m told that it&rsquo;s based on, or at least strongly inspired by, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Far from the Madding Crowd<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Thomas Hardy; he is one of my unfortunate missing authors, so I can&rsquo;t comment on that myself. I can say, however, that it&rsquo;s a great story, very moving, and a fine way of bringing graphic fiction to the mainstream reader (not that this is the first time <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has done this: they published Posy&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gemma Bovary<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a few years ago).</p>
<p>If you missed it, you can probably still read (at least some of) it on the website (though personally I find that unsatisfying because of the image quality). But I expect it&rsquo;ll be out in paperback by now (in fact, I was surprised they didn&rsquo;t get it out in time for Christmas).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is an absolute stormer of a book. A family drama, of sorts, set across thirty years and three billion years simultaneously.</p>
<p>The time is about now, and one night (in North America, at least), the stars go out. And the planets and the moon. But not the sun.</p>
<p>The Earth has been enclosed, by an entity or entities unknown (or is it a natural phenomenon?) in a membrane that closes off the outside universe, while allowing enough sunlight through for the ecosystem to function normally. Inside the membrane, time is slowed down, so that outside it the universe appears to spin on at a vastly accelerated rate.</p>

<p>But Iraq; the dodgy dossier; detention without trial; ID cards; ASBOs; and so on and on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a well-respected man, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bullshit!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You could&rsquo;ve been great<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,&rdquo; as The Waterboys once put it. Actually I wouldn&rsquo;t describe Blair as &ldquo;well-respected&rdquo;, so that doesn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>Should the government go to the country when the party leader steps down? Many think so, but actually, I largely don&rsquo;t. In theory we live in a representative democracy. Citizens vote for a representative for their local area, and the party with the most seats forms a government. If the leader retires - or even is kicked out, though that does put a different complexion on things - that doesn&rsquo;t change the position in parliament. And changing the leader does not necessarily mean a change of government.</p>
<p>On the other hand, calling an election wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad thing for the country, except for one problem: we&rsquo;d probably end up with a Tory government.</p>
<p>Though it shows how bad things have got when I find myself thinking that maybe a Tory government, if they would scrap ID cards, wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad thing.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a worrying thought.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Of course, the alternative world works on a feudal system, and weapons are mediaeval (apart from ones that have been carried over from &ldquo;our&rdquo; world).  So it has some of the tropes of fantasy, and more may develop.  But it looks like there won&rsquo;t be any magic other than the world-walking ability.</p>
<p>The main fault with it is that it shows its history as the first part of a much longer book which the publishers decided should be split in two.  So just as it&rsquo;s starting to get really interesting, it ends.</p>
<p>Oh well, I look forward to reading the second part, and its sequels.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>All three items I chose are things that I meant to get at the time they came out, but didn&rsquo;t, for one reason or another. The book was Christopher Priest&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Prestige<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I&rsquo;ve meant to get since I read the reviews when it came out. I&rsquo;m not sure why I never bought it (actually I did buy it once, but that was to give to a friend who had a particular interest in stage magic).</p>
<p>Anyway, my interest was recently rekindled because of the film coming out, of course. I may want to watch it one day, and I&rsquo;m not going to read or not read something on the reported say-so of some film director. I can&rsquo;t find a reference for that: the director is supposed to have said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t read the book before you see the film.&rdquo; Though I suppose that I will, in effect, be doing exactly that &ndash; in a contrary way &ndash; by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->insisting<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on reading the book before seeing the film. Whatever: books come first.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t bring you here to talk about books, for a change. No, this time it&rsquo;s music. Because I also got two CDs from Amazon.</p>
<p>Regular readers might not be surprised to hear that I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the late, and sadly missed,Joe Strummer. As such, I want to get a hold of anything he released that I don&rsquo;t yet have. Now, during his so-called &ldquo;wilderness years&rdquo;, Joe did a lot of soundtrack work. I&rsquo;ve got most of that on record, but I never got round to getting the soundtrack for Alex Cox&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Straight to Hell<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I recall hearing a borrowed copy in &lsquo;87 or so, and enjoying it, but not being overwhelmed by it. The one track I remembered was &lsquo;Rake at the Gates of Hell&rsquo;, by The Pogues, more of which later.</p>
<p>In the intervening years, I mostly forgot about the album. Once in a while I might have poked around a second-hand record shop, but it was low on my list of priorities. Recently, though, I discovered that it had been reissued, revised and expanded. Into my &ldquo;buy later&rdquo; list it went, until the other day.</p>
<p>As well, I discovered it was possible to jump back to an earlier part of Joe&rsquo;s career, namely his pre-Clash band, the 101ers. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elgin Avenue Breakdown<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was originally released back in 19-something-or-other. At the time I was mildly interested, but saw no need to rush out and buy it. I had the &lsquo;Keys to your Heart&rsquo; single, and it was OK, but nowhere near as good as the heights of The Clash. And Joe was still around, and we could expect new music from him in the future.</p>
<p>We are in that future now, of course, and we don&rsquo;t have Joe anymore. So buying the 101ers&rsquo; album is a way to hear him again.</p>
<p>And a damn fine album it is. Straight ahead rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll, jam-packed with bounce, verve and excitement. What it doesn&rsquo;t have is the political sensibilities of The Clash. Or actually, it does have the first vestiges of them; and indeed, the first vestiges of The Clash&rsquo;s excellent &lsquo;Jail Guitar Doors&rsquo; (the B-side of &lsquo;Clash City Rockers<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->'), in the form of &lsquo;Lonely Mothers Son&rsquo;. And I&rsquo;m sure that title should have an apostrophe in it, but I&rsquo;m not sure where.</p>
<p>And the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Straight to Hell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> soundtrack? It&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s mostly film music, of course: largely instrumentals. There are selections by Elvis Costello and Pray for Rain, as well as by The Pogues and Joe. Among the proper songs are one by Joe called &lsquo;Evil Darling&rsquo;, which is OK, and the original version of &lsquo;If I Should Fall from Grace With God&rsquo;, which The Pogues wrote during filming, apparently. Then there&rsquo;s a version of &lsquo;Danny Boy&rsquo;, by the cast, led by Cait O&rsquo;Riordan, and the album ends with &lsquo;Rake at the Gates of Hell&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to express how good that song is. From the opening guitar riff, through Shane&rsquo;s crazed-gunman-death-worshipper lyrics, to the shouldn&rsquo;t-work-but-does device of the verse and chorus being exactly the same tune, it struts into your ears and rips your head apart. In a good way. I&rsquo;ve hardly had it off repeat on my MP3 player since I got it.</p>
<p>Go and buy it. Now.</p>

<p>Heinlein used to be my absolute favourite author.  Indeed, he is in large part responsible for me developing a lifelong love of science fiction.  And I&rsquo;m also very fond of Spider Robinson.  So when I found out that this existed, obviously I had to buy it.</p>
<p>It seems that, sometime after the death of Heinlein&rsquo;s widow Virginia, his literary executor discovered an outline that Heinlein wrote in 1955, but never expanded into a novel.  If remarks by Heinlein, that Spider refers to in his afterword, are true, then it was John W Campbell who talked him out of doing so.  Which seems strange, and rather sad.  Still, if Heinlein had written that novel, it&rsquo;s possible that we wouldn&rsquo;t have had one of his other ones; and of course, we wouldn&rsquo;t have this one.</p>
<p>Would that be a good or bad thing, though?  That is what we are here to decide.</p>
<p>I became intensely irritated by the story early on.  The first-person narrator is supposed to be eighteen years old at the start, and he just doesn&rsquo;t sound like an eighteen-year old.  I don&rsquo;t mean the narrative voice: that would not be a problem, as we can assume that the narrator is supposed to be telling his story in later years.  I&rsquo;m talking about his dialogue, and particularly his thought processes.</p>
<p>Tied to this is the fact that we are left largely in the dark about the society on Earth where the novel starts.   The only thing we learn is that sexual mores have gone backwards by several hundred years, in North America, at least.  Our narrator and his beloved can&rsquo;t move in together, or even just spend the night together (despite living independently from any parents or guardians): they have to get married if they want to have sex.  That his how Spider gets round the fifties expectations of Heinlein&rsquo;s outline, of course, but it doesn&rsquo;t sound like any eighteen-year olds I&rsquo;ve ever heard of.</p>
<p>Except, perhaps, those who subscribe to one of the world&rsquo;s many anti-sex religions, which these two don&rsquo;t.  In fact, the handling of religion in this work is quite interesting.</p>
<p>It is slotted into the timeline of Heinlein&rsquo;s &lsquo;Future History&rsquo; stories.  In that timeline, the name of Nehemia Scudder appears, but I don&rsquo;t think there is a story in which he ever appears directly as a character.  Scudder is some kind of Christian fundamentalist leader, who becomes, I think, the World President.  In this novel we are after the time of the Prophets &ndash; Scudder and his successors &ndash; and the world is still recovering from the restrictions that were placed on life, on scientific research, by them: &ldquo;We could have had immortality by now,&rdquo; one character complains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good story, but not as good as it could be.  Robinson has obviously worked hard at &ldquo;channelling&rdquo; RAH, but it seems to me that there are parts of the story where things just don&rsquo;t quite fit together, or totally make sense.  Though this may in part due to the speed with which I read it.</p>
<p>It is, of course, a good thing when a book makes you read it quickly: it usually means that the plot is compelling and you are keen to find out how it will play out.  But if it causes you to skim, and miss &ndash; or at least, imperfectly absorb &ndash; important information, then that&rsquo;s not so good.  Though I don&rsquo;t think that can really be considered a criticism of a book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth a read, and I suppose I might read it again at some point, to see whether I did just miss some bits; but I&rsquo;d probably prefer to re-read, say <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Have Space Suit, Will Travel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;m enjoying writing it, and intend to finish it anyway, just on general principles. It doesn&rsquo;t do to go around having lots of unfinished pieces (and I speak as someone who has a great many unfinished things lying around, of one variety or another).</p>
<p>When I do finish it, I&rsquo;ll probably put it online. Now my question is, does such a work now count as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fanfic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I suppose it does, on some level.

<p>It was a good night. I missed the first reading, by Anna Feruglio Dal Dan, but heard various drabbles, Andrew&rsquo;s story, and two other fine stories.</p>
<p>During the interval I picked up the back issues of the magazine and took out a subscription. Then at the end we helped the Editor, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wendy Bradley<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, to carry some boxes back to her flat, and drank her whisky.</p>

<p>I was brought up as a Catholic, but I grew out of it, and am, like any sensible person, profoundly anti-religious now.  And what I say to the Catholics who would try to destroy one of the few good, well-intentioned pieces of legislation that this government has brought in, is this:</p>
<p>We here in Britain are trying to build a tolerant, inclusive, multicultural society.  If you can&rsquo;t work within that, within the laws and regulations that govern adoption, then you shouldn&rsquo;t be in the adoption business.  And if you don&rsquo;t like the way our society is developing, maybe you&rsquo;d be happier elsewhere.  I hear they&rsquo;ve got quite a theocracy going in Iran.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s nothing to stop people saying the same to me, when I speak out against ID cards, for example.  But that&rsquo;s democracy for ya: full of contradictions.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve been reading it I&rsquo;ve also read 19, 20, 21 and 22, but they are all graphic novels, and quite short.  As well as that I generally read parts of the Saturday <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; a few magazines (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->London Cyclist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matrix<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vector<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, occasionally <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New Statesman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or one of the Linux magazines); and of course, a rake of blogs.  But apart from those, it&rsquo;s just been this one steadily for about two and a half months.  And there are two more volumes to go: each, I believe, of a similar length.</p>
<p>None of which tells us anything about the content of the book, of course.  It is an interesting exercise, apart from anything else: Stephenson cleverly educates us science geeks about history, by linking the doings of kings and lords with those of Isaac Newton and other luminaries of the Royal Society.  Or so I first thought.  But then I realised that simultaneously, or alternatively, it does the opposite: it teaches humanities geeks (who presumably can be expected to know about the history) something about the science of the time.</p>
<p>More importantly, though, it&rsquo;s a damn good story.  The first third tells the first part of the story of Daniel Waterhouse, who is the son of a Puritan family that is expecting the apocalypse to come in 1666.  Of course, with the Plague and the Great Fire, it seems like it is.</p>
<p>Waterhouse is a Natural Philosopher, though (or scientist, as we would say).  He goes to Cambridge, where he becomes the room-mate and friend of a hick from the country, one Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>I was reading it at a roaring pace all through the first part, but for me it lagged suddenly when the second part started, and we are introduced to a new set of characters, principally a vagabond called Jack Shaftoe (he has a brother called Bob, but I don&rsquo;t know whether he is meant to be anything to do with the song) and a young woman called Eliza who was a harem slave to the Turks, and whom Jack frees.</p>
<p>The pace picks up again as we get to know these characters, and their peregrinations round the courts and battlefields of Europe mean that their paths eventually cross with Daniel and the other Royal Society members from part one.  Which takes us to part three.</p>
<p>Far too much happens to give even a summary here.  There are the births of princes and the deaths of kings, war, conquest and betrayal.  Almost most importantly of all, the early scientists are probing and extending their understanding of the workings of the universe (of &lsquo;creation&rsquo; as they would term it).</p>
<p>Most importantly of all, there are the lives of ordinary people going on against this backdrop</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fantastic work, and as the first part of a trilogy, it isn&rsquo;t marred by Stephenson&rsquo;s noted difficulty with endings.  I look forward eagerly to reading the second and third volumes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it won SF awards, though: just being written by an SF author really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->isn&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enough to make a book SF.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Indeed, I fairly often find myself annoyed or frustrated with sections of comics where the story is told entirely or mainly visually, and for reasons of poor reproduction, or just the artist(s) not being as good as they think they are, it&rsquo;s hard to work out what&rsquo;s supposed to be going on.</p>
<p>That happened to a small extent in one of the stories here, in which Gaiman uses the &lsquo;old&rsquo; Sandman character, who was published by DC long ago, and was in abeyance when he reimagined the character as the Lord of Dreams that we know today.  The old Sandman is a masked adventurer in the intra-war years.  His mask is a gas mask, and his weapon is a gun that fires sleeping gas.</p>
<p>This story is a kind of crossover between the two versions of The Sandman.  The old one has cause to visit the house in England where an old wizard has the Lord of Dreams captured - as at the very start of Gaiman&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in other words.</p>
<p>All in all, reading this was not time wasted, but it wasn&rsquo;t that great.</p>

<p>So we start the year without having done a review of the last one, and without even having posted all of last year&rsquo;s Book Notes. I have nine (nine!) written or partially written, but unposted, mini book reviews, that I&rsquo;ll try to put up over the next few days. Perhaps I should slap them all together into one, but that would really be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->too<!-- raw HTML omitted --> big, and would make it harder to find things in future. So Book Notes 2006 entries will keep on appearing for a while yet.</p>
<p>And since I&rsquo;ve made myself a New Year&rsquo;s resolution to write every day, I hope to be making considerably more posts in general than last year. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I hope everyone had a fine Christmas or other winter festival, and an equally good start to the New Year.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Not much chance of that ever happening to this one, mind you (though they&rsquo;ve done <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Scanner Darkly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> now, so you never can tell).</p>
<p>This is kind of a prequel or counterpart to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Valis<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I read a good number of years ago.  In a similar way, Dick himself is one of the central characters, though it is not him who believes that an alien intelligence &ndash; the Vast Active Living Intelligence System &ndash; is communicating with him.</p>
<p>We are in an alternative America: instead of Nixon becoming President in 1968, an even more authoritarian, fascist figure called Ferris F Freemont does.  His regime quickly takes on an extreme McCarthyite nature.</p>
<p>Valis sends a message of hope from beyond the stars.  Or is it from another dimension?  Or is it God?  Nicholas Brady does not know, and neither do we.  A significant portion of the book consists of him and his writer friend, Phil, discussing possibilities for what it could be that contacts him in dreams, and sometimes lends him lifesaving information and even healing powers.  But no real conclusion is reached.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an OK read, but is largely unresolved by the end: though not without hope.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>We are, once again, in the territory of myths walking the Earth. This time they are angels and demons, gods and devils, and their powers extend far beyond Earth, and into the Vellum. This is a kind of multiverse, a visual metaphor for the many-worlds theory, you might say (though the book walks the fantasy line, more than science fiction, the use of nanotech notwithstanding).</p>
<p>It starts really well, and I loved the whole first half, but the second half loses focus somewhat. The pace slows, and it seems a tad repetitive. Though I may have picked up this last criticism from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Clute&rsquo;s review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of it, which I glanced at while I was reading the book.</p>
<p>Reading the whole of Clute&rsquo;s review now, I agree with much of it, though I&rsquo;m left feeling considerably more positive about the book as a whole than Clute obviously was.</p>
<p>In a way it feels unfinished: not just that it leaves you wanting more, which is a good thing, but I found myself thinking, on more than one occasion after it ended, that I hadn&rsquo;t actually finished reading it. However, Hal himself <!-- raw HTML omitted -->points us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which captures the meaning of the ending perfectly, and makes me think I need to read things more closely and think about them more carefully. Though sometimes you just need to have something pointed out to you, to make you realise that you understood it all along.</p>
<p>It is a great, sparkling debut (though whether it is possible for work to be simultaneously a debut and a &lsquo;masterpiece&rsquo;, as the blurb has it, is something that caused some discussion in my house), and highly recommended.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t reiterate the many general arguments against the death penalty here, but consider these.  Collins tried to justify the execution of Saddam by citing the brutality of Saddam&rsquo;s regime. The thing is, you don&rsquo;t demonstrate the wrongness of a brutal regime by exercising the most brutal form of punishment. You don&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->win<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that way: at best you draw, and who wants to draw with a dictator? You win by showing that you&rsquo;re <!-- raw HTML omitted -->better<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than that; by behaving in a civilised way.</p>
<p>He went on to say that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;incoherent&rdquo; that Britain should have nuclear weapons, but not have the option to execute terrorists. I see absolutely no logical connection between the two, and neither did Michael Portillo. Nor could Collins make the connection in a way that made any sense.</p>
<p>Using the death penalty isn&rsquo;t a sign of strength: it&rsquo;s a sign of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->weakness<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The truly strong can both show mercy, and behave in a way that separates them from the caveman.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I used to read John Clute&rsquo;s book reviews in <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interzone<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, years ago, when he reviewed there regularly,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> so linguistic strangeness was exactly what I expected when I picked this up.</p>
<p>What I mean by linguistic strangeness is this: you used to have to read his reviews with a good dictionary to hand, and if you were diligent you might learn three new words in even the shortest review.  His erudition was legendary, and he liked to display it.  At first that used to annoy me, because it seemed that he chose willfully obscure words: he appeared to be doing no more than displaying his vocabulary for its own sake.  Showing off, in other words.</p>
<p>But as time went on I grew to appreciate the way he made us stretch, and I moved towards the conclusion that, yes, he had an unfeasibly large vocabulary &ndash; or was unreasonably quick to reach for the thesaurus &ndash; but he did it in order to achieve precision in meaning: why use a word that is nearly right, when there is one that is exactly right? Plus, it was part of his style, his reviewer&rsquo;s voice, if you will.</p>
<p>So to his first SF novel, then.  It is strange.  It is very, very strange.  It&rsquo;s a space opera set in our galaxy a few hundred years in the future.  There are humans and a range of aliens, plus various sentient AIs.  Much is made of the fact that humans smell: they have to keep away from other species, and avoid getting emotional when they do meet others, to keep their pheromone production under control.  No other sentient species suffers from this problem, it seems.  Furthermore, when humans meet each other, it is very unusual &ndash; extremely rude, even &ndash; to make eye contact.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Clute is trying to tell us something about our own society, here, but it seems to me that, with the state of technology on display, something would have been done about the smell, if it was really that much of a problem.  The eye-contact thing is just bizarre.  Maybe (since they exist in a state of close integrations with their computers, intelligent and not) it&rsquo;s a reference to the lack of direct personal contact that we get from our present interactions on the net.</p>
<p>Those are relatively minor matters, though: what of the story?</p>
<p>Our hero is Freer, who is a free trader, with his own ship, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tile Dance<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It is staffed solely by him and run by a sentient pair of artificial Minds: KathKirt.  All AIs are bipartite; they manifest through Masks, which are said to &lsquo;face&rsquo; &lsquo;Jack&rsquo; or &lsquo;Flyte&rsquo;.   I still don&rsquo;t understand what these are supposed to mean.  Did I mention that it&rsquo;s a strange book?</p>
<p>The galaxy is in danger from something called plaque, which appears to be a kind of plague causing a dementia-like effect in artificial Minds (and maybe in biological ones, too; that wasn&rsquo;t clear).  As things develop, it turns out that a passenger that Freer Has taken aboard knows the route to a legendary planet which is the source of &lsquo;Lenses&rsquo;, the only thing that can cure the data plague.</p>
<p>They have to run from the forces of the Insort Geront, who want to stop them getting the Lenses.  These are spacefaring luddites, in the form of multi-bodied (or at least multi-headed) quadrupeds (possibly) who are constantly eating live prey, including the younger members of their own families.</p>
<p>On the way they dock at an artificial moon, which turns out to be a legendary lost world.  Or something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an awful lot going on in this book, and I can&rsquo;t honestly say that I understood all of it. But it&rsquo;s a fascinating read in many ways, and is worth the effort.  Recommended.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Though as it happens, the context of that one story is different from that of all the others. The others are all set in Viriconium, or in the lands that surround it. This final one is set in our world; it tells the tale of some people who dream of Viriconium, who believe that it is real, who believe that they might be able to reach it one day.</p>
<p>Whether anyone would actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->want<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get to Viriconium if they could is another matter. It is a sort of dream city at the end of time. It has a constant feeling that the world has run down, that time is running out. Humanity has fallen from the great technological highs of the &lsquo;Afternoon Cultures&rsquo;, and now survives on scavenged technology - machines so advanced that they are still running after millennia - and on traditional crafts.</p>
<p>So most of the weaponry, for example, consists of swords, but there are a few prized energy blades, or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->baans<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. People travel on horseback, or walk, to get around, especially after the last few aircars are destroyed in the War of the Two Queens, which is part of the subject matter of &lsquo;The Pastel City&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Did I mention that this doesn&rsquo;t belong in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fantasy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Masterworks line? Just because people fight with swords, and the technology is advanced beyond their understanding into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clarke&rsquo;s (Third) Law<!-- raw HTML omitted --> territory, doesn&rsquo;t make a book sword &amp; sorcery. This is science fiction, where the science is breaking down; or at least, the knowledge of it is.</p>
<p>Despite all the stories having been published before, there are copyright dates for only a few of them, and previous-publication details for none. Which to my mind detracts slightly from the collection.</p>
<p>Also, the first story is listed as &lsquo;Viriconium Knights&rsquo; in the contents and on its own title page, but as Viriconium Nights&quot; (which is the title I recall having heard of before) on the copyright page. This could, of course, be deliberate, as I have a vague recollection of having heard that this is not a simple collection and republication, but that there has also been some reworking.</p>
<p>It is not easy reading: it is a 500-page book, and it took me over a month to read it. Now, I&rsquo;m not that fast a reader these days, but that is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->slow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But at no point was I thinking, &ldquo;This is heavy going,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be bothered with this.&rdquo; Rather, it&rsquo;s just that some prose styles are denser than others, and Harrison&rsquo;s is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dense<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In a good way. Highly recommended.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>But in the end it wasn&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bad.  The queue began moving fairly quickly &ndash; or smoothly, at least &ndash; and while it was frustrating, it was bearable, as long as you didn&rsquo;t let yourself <!-- raw HTML omitted -->get<!-- raw HTML omitted --> frustrated.  The passport/boarding-pass-control desk looked a right mess, though, covered as it was by abandoned bottles, cosmetics containers and what have you.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m not actually sure why the queues were so long.  The only things that have changed in security terms compared with a few months ago are the prohibited items in hand baggage, and the enforcement of the &ldquo;only one item&rdquo; rule (I&rsquo;m sure this has been the rule for decades, but it just wasn&rsquo;t strictly enforced).  Both of those issues should be dealt with at checkin, so when you get to the security gates you should be ready.  Every bag and coat is x-rayed, as before: but there should be fewer bags; everyone goes through a metal detector, just as they always did.  There was a &ldquo;please take off your shoes&rdquo; section after the metal detectors, but as we paused at it, one security guy called, &ldquo;Not everybody, not everybody,&rdquo; and waved us on.  I suppose people were randomly chosen, and incidentally, everyone I saw taking their shoes off was white.  This may, of course, just mean that people who look like terrorists (whatever that may mean) are not travelling, from fear of being hassled.</p>
<p>I conclude that the only reason for the giant queues must be stupidity: there must be people who, even though they are asked about prohibited items at checkin, and even though this stuff has been in the news for weeks, still have drinks in their hand luggage, and then have to stop to abandon them at security.  Or who try to take more than one item on, even though they&rsquo;ve been told not to.  And yet, I didn&rsquo;t see much of that happening.  I really don&rsquo;t understand why the queues got so big.  There were plenty of security staff on duty, too.</p>
<p>Coming back, things were much less fraught at Glasgow Airport, as they generally are at smaller airports, in my experience.</p>
<p>Throughout, I have to say, all the security staff we encountered were cheerful, polite, and helpful, while doing a largely thankless, probably quite dull, job, filled with seemingly-arbitrary rule changes handed down from above.  I can&rsquo;t really fault them, no matter how daft some of the things they have to enforce may be.</p>
<p>A last thought: we are being conditioned to accept travelling with photo ID, even within the country.  It was strange to see everyone queuing up to get onto a flight to Scotland, with their passports ready.  Now I&rsquo;d be quite happy to see EU passports issued by the Republic of Scotland (as long as it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a republic), but for now, it was still a journey within the UK.</p>
<p>And the strange thing is, it seems to be the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->airlines<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are driving this, not the authorities.  I have had to show photo ID on RyanAir and EasyJet, but a few months ago &ndash; this year, certainly &ndash; I flew to Scotland with BMI Baby, and not only did they not ask for ID, but I didn&rsquo;t even have to see a human to check in: hand baggage, a credit card, and a self-checkin machine, and there I was.  That was before all the recent fuss, true, but RyanAir (and possibly EasyJet) have been asking for ID for years.  Are they secretly being used by the government to get us used to carrying ID cards?  And if so, why is it only some airlines?</p>
<p>Or am I being unreasonably paranoid?  &lsquo;Cos I only want to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reasonably<!-- raw HTML omitted --> paranoid, you know.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s fair enough, right?  You&rsquo;re granting them a non-exclusive licence to use the material.  But it goes on to say:</p>

<p>Umm, &ldquo;exercise all copyright&rdquo;?  Now I&rsquo;m not so sure.  Let&rsquo;s see what else there is.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ouch.  I don&rsquo;t like the sound of that.  Now the thing that got me looking at this was this, which is not in the Ts&amp;Cs, but right on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->submission page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not just overbearingly copywrong, but ungrammatical, too.  Ouchy, ouchy, ouch, ouch!</p>
<p>Then, as if to add stupidity to a lack of concern for people&rsquo;s work, there is a section entitled, &ldquo;Links to this Website.&rdquo; It includes the following paragraph:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ok, so they&rsquo;re not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->banning<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->deep links<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, they&rsquo;re just warning you that they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->might<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do so.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So it&rsquo;s all right to take thousands of random contributors' work away from them, but we can&rsquo;t in turn reproduce or reuse <!-- raw HTML omitted -->your<!-- raw HTML omitted --> work (or that of the random contributors)?</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon, guys, this is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->web<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: linking is what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>And as to copyright: The History Matters project is founded, according to its <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FAQ<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All publicly-funded and/or charitable bodies, if I&rsquo;m not very much mistaken.</p>
<p>Now you may think that I&rsquo;m being unreasonably cautious about this.  I&rsquo;m just some guy in London writing about his day.  It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stealing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> what I write, or as if what I write matters that much in the grand scheme of things.  And that&rsquo;s true enough.  I have absolutely no problem with them using what I might write.  Indeed, all my writing here is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Creative-Commons-licensed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so you don&rsquo;t even have to ask if you want to use it.  The problem is this: if you follow the letter of the agreement, then <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lose all rights over what I submit to them.  That means that if I write a description of my day, submit it to the project, and then post a copy here, on my blog (as I intended to do), then I&rsquo;ll be in breach of copyright.</p>
<p>And that is madness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving them the benefit of the doubt: I&rsquo;m working on the assumption that this is just carelessness; that the terms and conditions are just poorly thought through, rather than deliberately evil.  But really, someone there has a duty to take care.  When you&rsquo;re a public body soliciting material created by the public, you have no moral right to claim the exclusive intellectual rights over that material.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a bit invisible on here for a while.  First I had two weeks camping in France, during which (among much else) I managed to grow a beard (not that I was particularly trying to: it just kind of happened).  In the first couple of weeks after getting back I spent much of my free time on preparing a CD for a special occasion.</p>
<p>The occasion was the golden wedding anniversary of my beloved&rsquo;s parents.  They had asked me to provide some music for after the dinner.  The brief was to get the grandkids dancing.  The theme we chose was to cover all the decades from 1956 to 2006.</p>
<p>Now, strange as it may seem, I&rsquo;ve never actually made a compilation CD before, despite having had the technology to do so for several years.  I was never really very big on making compilation tapes, either.  So the first thing to do was to check that the technology worked.</p>
<p>Our CD writer hasn&rsquo;t written under Windows since we got Dell to replace the whole drive when it broke down.  It&rsquo;s doubtless some kind of driver problem, but I haven&rsquo;t bothered to try to fix it.  I know what you&rsquo;re thinking: CD writers are as cheap as potatoes these days; but never buy a new one when there&rsquo;s a way to get the old one working, I say.  The logical solution, then, was to use Linux, where the same drive does work; and which is my preferred working environment anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kubuntu<!-- raw HTML omitted --> distribution, and as it is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->KDE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> based, the logical CD creation tool seems to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->K3B<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  This is essentially a graphical front end to various command-line tools, which is a fine approach.  Unfortunately the GUI is a bit clunky.  Still, nothing I couldn&rsquo;t live with (once I had dowloaded and installed the plugin that allows it to recognise MP3s, at least).</p>
<p>So the next thing was to consider how to get the tracks we wanted.  We already had quite a lot, of course, but inevitably there were plenty that we wanted that we didn&rsquo;t have.  I  briefly considered the iTunes Music Store, but rejected it because a) I was using Linux, so couldn&rsquo;t use iTunes; b) my MP3 player is not an iPod, so it (ITMS) would have been little use to me after this project; and c) most importantly of all, I didn&rsquo;t want to have to struggle with DRM(Digital Restrictions Management, thought they&rsquo;d like you to believe it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rights&rdquo;.).</p>
<p>I already use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eMusic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is good for relatively recent, independent stuff, but is not really a source of classic tracks.  I did get &lsquo;Rock Around the Clock&rsquo; from there, though.  As well as that, Frances bought a couple of new CDs: a Paul Simon collection and a disco compilation.</p>
<p>But for the rest, and for the maximum flexibility, there was only one solution: I would have to enter the murky grey-area waters of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AllOfMP3.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t come across this site, it&rsquo;s based in Russia and a legal grey area.  The people who run it claim to be following the copyright laws of Russia; and presumably that is true, because the site continues to operate.  However, they are able to offer a vast collection of albums for mere pennies per track.  And all in a selection of formats, and without DRM.</p>
<p>The grey area is that we may be breaking the law by using their services in other countries, such as the UK.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still running, though, so let&rsquo;s work on the assumption that it&rsquo;s OK to use it.</p>
<p>I set up an AllOfMP3 account, and by a daft number of steps of indirection, got some money into it, and downloaded a few tracks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good stuff: they have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->huge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> selection of tracks, and the prices are so cheap.  I think it has something to teach iTunes and the other legal download sites: the less you charge (and the less encumbered the files) the more people will buy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there was a track, or at least an artist, that I couldn&rsquo;t find on it.</p>
<p>Oh, OK, there were two, but they&rsquo;re both a tad embarassing.  We got a late request for the following tracks: &lsquo;Summer Holiday&rsquo;; &lsquo;Y Viva España&rsquo;; and &lsquo;Remember You&rsquo;re A Womble&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Yes, I know.  But since novelty hits (and songs from kids' TV shows) were by no means outwith the scope of the project (and since we aleady had both &lsquo;Crazy Frog&rsquo; and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bratz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> TV theme), I attempted to comply.</p>
<p>Which was harder than you might have expected.  AllOfMP3 had the first, but the second was slightly harder.  I did find it, though, squirreled away on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->somebody&rsquo;s MP3 blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which seems to mainly consist of tracks ripped from old tapes found in the Dalston branch of Oxfam: the ripper/blogger is practically a neighbour).</p>
<p>Those Wombles, though: they&rsquo;re hard to find.</p>
<p>There is a strange  class of sites out there that list the contents of albums, and appear to allow you to click through and buy the the tracks; but when you do, you get a screen saying, &ldquo;That track is not available&rdquo;, or &ldquo;This album is not available&rdquo;.  Which makes me wonder why they bother to list it on their sites; or at least, why they list it with live links that make it look as if you can buy it.</p>
<p>Anyway, somewhere on the deeper, darker recesses of the net, on the very last page of sites that, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as far as Google knew<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, contained the string, &ldquo;remember you&rsquo;re a Womble&rdquo;, I found it.  Or at least part of it: it ends very abruptly.  But in the context of the compilation, that didn&rsquo;t actually seem to matter too much.</p>
<p>The party was a great success.  The music went down very well, with only one slight problem: we overran our time in the hotel&rsquo;s function suite, and never got to play the second disk.  Too much eating, not enough dancing, I suppose.</p>
<p>Still, now that I&rsquo;ve done one, making other compilation CDs should be a doddle.</p>
<p>Oh, and the beard (I mentioned it earlier, you weren&rsquo;t paying attention) came off before the party.  The kids complained, but some things just have to go.</p>
<p>The track listing?  Oh all right then:</p>

<p>So, how is it?  In particular, how does it hold up to a re-reading?  The short answers are &ldquo;great&rdquo; and &ldquo;really well&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for Rowling&rsquo;s work, an unashamed big fan.  And obviously, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been reading it again if I hadn&rsquo;t liked it the first time.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it&rsquo;s great.  Probably not the best of the series (though I&rsquo;m not sure I could say what that is), but not the worst, either.</p>
<p>I have a view on the major plot spoiler, but I won&rsquo;t go into that here.  Suffice to say that I&rsquo;m largely convinced by the arguments of <a href="http://DumbledoreIsNotDead.com">the site whose very domain name is a spoiler</a> (though I see that it has changed its name, now).</p>
<p>What with Harry Potter, the Lemony Snicket books, the Artemis Fowl books and others, we are truly living through a golden age of children&rsquo;s literature (or at least, publishing).</p>
<p>I was surprised, when I asked my son whether he was more eagerly awaiting &ldquo;Seven or Thirteen,&rdquo; that he said, &ldquo;Thirteen.&rdquo;  Perhaps he sensed that Mr Snicket would be finished before Ms Rowling; and it turns out that he was right: the final adventure of the unfortunate Baudelaire orphans is coming out next month (on Friday the thirteenth, suitably enough.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s based on work that Gaiman did with Alice Cooper for a concept album that the latter released in 1994.  I didn&rsquo;t know that people still made concept albums, but there you go.</p>
<p>Also there is one theme in particular that Gaiman was to revisit in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->American Gods<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; namely that of the town where children disappear periodically.  In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->American Gods<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the periodic disappearance (and murder, let&rsquo;s face it) of the child acts a kind of spell, which protects a town from the encroachment of the rest of the world and the forces of modernity and &lsquo;development&rsquo;.  In this work, there&rsquo;s no suggestion that the children&rsquo;s absorption into the &lsquo;Theater of the Real&rsquo; brings advantage to anyone other than the the semi-mythical &lsquo;Showman&rsquo;.  Gaiman was perhaps using this work to develop some of the ideas that he would return to later.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that, of course, but as I say, the work as a whole seems shallow and perhaps incomplete, compared to, say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sandman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Well, I can always blame  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NaNoWriMo <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for missing November.  I didn&rsquo;t manage to write 50,000 words, but I did manage 20,000, which I&rsquo;m pretty damn pleased about; and I&rsquo;m carrying on with it, too.  Maybe by next year&rsquo;s NaNoWriMo I&rsquo;ll have it finished.  It&rsquo;s strange how a completely arbitrary, but externally-defined, deadline can boost creativity.  In theory I ought to be able to set myself a deadline and get the same effect, but to date I&rsquo;ve never managed to do so.</p>
<p>If 50,000 is a Nanowrimo, though, I declare myself to have completed 40 Picowrimos.</p>
<p>Other news: in a shock move I am close to resolving not to vote Labour at the next election.  If they carry on with their ID cards madness they will have to be stopped.  I intend to write to my MP and to the Home Secretary (who has other things on his mind at the moment, which with any luck will distract him from his authoritarian tendencies).  The former will only have my vote if he promises to vote against the bill at every possible opportunity (and does so).</p>
<p>It will break my heart to put my cross in the wrong box, as well as exposing us to the danger of another Tory government;  but the ID cards scheme — and even more importantly, the database that will support it — is unconscionable . One encouraging thing I saw this morning was the letters page in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Metro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: all the letters about ID cards were against them.  That&rsquo;s a very small sample, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Metro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is owned by the same group as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daily Mail<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If publishers with an authoritarian right-wing background are turning against the idea of ID cards, then maybe they can be stopped yet. You would expect liberterian right-wingers to be against them, of course. I&rsquo;m reminded of one of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heinlein<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s sayings (probably through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lazarus Long<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), which I recall as: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When a society requires its members to carry ID, it&rsquo;s time to leave that society.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  A spot of googling, however, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reminds me<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that it really was:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No2ID <!-- raw HTML omitted -->people still have their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->petition <!-- raw HTML omitted -->up, so you should sign that if you feel as I do.  And write to your MP.  Or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fax them<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If this paternity/visagate business takes Blunkett down, will he take the ID cards bill with him?  I hope so, but expect not.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>He came to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edinburgh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, possibly every year that I was there, and me and my mates<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Steve<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Johnny<!-- raw HTML omitted --> used to go along to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chambers Street Union<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (now vacated, I read at that link) for the occasion. It wasn&rsquo;t quite like listening to his radio show, of course, because he didn&rsquo;t talk that much, and probably didn&rsquo;t play such a wide variety of records. But what you were sure of getting was a club night — or &lsquo;disco&rsquo;, as we used to call them — of absolutely top quality music; and this at a time when the normal club or disco played nothing but absolutely execrable chart rubbish, and had a dress code into the bargain. Some student nights were OK, but once a year there was a night you knew was going to soar.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;ll play &lsquo;Release the Bats&rsquo; if you’ll dance,” I remember him saying.  He did.  We did</p>
<p>One year, when we were sitting in the bar before it started, we saw him sitting across the room, with some people from the union committee. We&rsquo;d have loved to talk to him, but we were too shy to just approach him. So we came up with a plan. Steve and I were on the committee of the Edinburgh University <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Science Fiction Society<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Why not invent a new class of member, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Honorary<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, to go with the existing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ordinary<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and make Peelie one?  So we did.</p>
<p>And still being too shy, Steve and I sent Johnny (who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wasn&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a committee member, remember) over to make him the offer and give him the membership card.</p>
<p>Though unless Steve always happened to have a few spare membership cards on him (unlikely), we must have planned this out in advance, to some degree. Memory plays tricks. Anyway, Johnny reported that he had said he was happy to receive anything that was free, and took the card graciously. I like to imagine that it still lies somewhere in a drawer at Peel Acres.</p>
<p>The only other time any of us spoke to him was afterwards (and Steve wasn&rsquo;t there, so it must have been a different year), when we were hanging around outside, and Peelie was loading boxes of records into his car.</p>
<p>Johnny asked him what his real name was (why, I don&rsquo;t know, and I doubt that Johnny will remember after all these years).</p>
<p>“John Ravenscroft,” Peelie said.</p>
<p>“Oh, I thought it was something else,” Johnny said.</p>
<p>The real triumph, though (and this must have been a different year again, but I can tell you the exact date: 20th January 1985) was when we got a record played for Johnny&rsquo;s 21st birthday.</p>
<p>The Roadshow fell on the actual day, and at some point, one of us (and it was probably Steve, as I don&rsquo;t remember doing it (though he won&rsquo;t either)) went up to the DJ booth with a request. As the night drew to a close we began to fear that he the great man hadn&rsquo;t managed to get to our request. But then, with only around three minutes left, Peelie said, “I&rsquo;ve got a request here that says, &lsquo;Please play something by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Skids<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as it&rsquo;s John&rsquo;s 21st.&rsquo;   Well, I doubt it&rsquo;s really his 21st, and I don&rsquo;t have any Skids with me, but John, this is for you.”</p>
<p>And then (at the right speed) came the opening drumbeats of the track that everyone from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Radio One<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Newsnight<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been playing in the last couple of days: “Teeenage Kicks.”</p>
<p>And we all danced.  And Peelie went home.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t see its like — or his like, of course — again.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Now, more than ever, I realise that we&rsquo;ve lost one of the greats.</p>
<p>We all blogged <a href="https://devilgate.org/2003/09/08/warren-finally-gets.html">Warren Zevon&rsquo;s
death</a>, but now I want to
write an appreciation of him. This may turn into a rant against death
and the loss of the greats, but if so, so be it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seven o&rsquo;clock, Eight o&rsquo;clock, Nine o&rsquo;clock, Ten<br>
You wanna go home?<br>
Why? Honey, when?<br>
We may never get this chance again!<br>
Let&rsquo;s party for the rest of the night!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got his last two albums a week or two back, and they haven&rsquo;t been out
of my personal CD player since. I&rsquo;m listening to <em><a href="http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/z/zevonwarren-myrides.shtml">My Ride&rsquo;s
Here</a></em>
as I write this. At least as I start it. I&rsquo;ll probably have alternated
between it and <em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/reviews/story/0,11712,1040070,00.html">The
Wind</a></em>
a few times before I finish.</p>
<p>He died at the top of his game: the three albums that closed his career
contain some of the best things he&rsquo;s ever done: <em><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=28286">Life&rsquo;ll Kill
Ya</a></em>, <em>My
Ride&rsquo;s Here</em> and <em>The Wind</em>. I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s ever &ldquo;a good
day to die,&rdquo; or even, really, that you can have a &ldquo;good
death&rdquo;. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a thought for another day. The point here is that Warren died
having completed his final album, said goodbye to his family, friends
and fans, and even seen the latest James Bond film. If you&rsquo;ve gotta go,
it&rsquo;s better than most of us can expect. Unlike <a href="http://www.strummersite.com/">Joe
Strummer</a>, for example, who <a href="http://devilgate.livejournal.com/2002/12/23/">died at the
tail end of last year</a>,
and who was taken from us totally by surprise: he wasn&rsquo;t sick, and
no-one expected it; and he had no chance to finish things. Which is how
most people die, of course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eleven o&rsquo;clock, Twelve o&rsquo;clock, One o&rsquo;clock, Two<br>
Me, tired? Well boo hoo!<br>
I&rsquo;m starting to fall in love with you<br>
Let&rsquo;s party for the rest of the night!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like to think though, that, despite all that, Warren went raging
against the dying of the light; and &lsquo;<a href="http://www.poplyrics.net/waiguo/rock/warrenzevon/133.htm">The Rest Of The
Night</a>&rsquo;, from
his last album, is the perfect roar of defiance to hurl at the darkness.
Yet at the same time it shows some of the resignation, or acceptance, we
see on some of the other tracks, such as &lsquo;<a href="http://www.leoslyrics.com/listlyrics.php?hid=9ywHWfdU4T4%3D">Keep Me in Your
Heart</a>&rsquo;.
Many have described the latter track, which closes the album, as the
most affecting song on it; and I can scarcely listen to it without a
lump coming to my throat.</p>
<p>Yet &lsquo;The Rest Of The Night&rsquo; is the song that, for me, captures the
end-times nature of the album more than any other.</p>
<p>As a straightforward party anthem it&rsquo;s right up there with Springsteen&rsquo;s
&lsquo;<a href="http://www.lyricsdomain.com/lyrics/31082/">Mary&rsquo;s Place</a>&rsquo;, from last
year&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/">The Rising</a></em>. (The comparison
is particularly apt, because Springsteen provides guitar and backing
vocal&rsquo;s on <em>The Wind</em>&rsquo;s other rabble-rouser, &lsquo;Disorder In The House&rsquo;.)
But it&rsquo;s in the context of his impending death that &lsquo;The Rest Of The
Night&rsquo; really takes wing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may never get this chance again&rdquo; is the key line here. Of course,
considered rationally, that is true of any of us, any time, about any
experience; Zevon must have felt it very keenly, though, whether or not
he was well enough to party.</p>
<p>Then the line, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting to fall in love with you&rdquo; suggests that,
even as &ldquo;the old whore death&rdquo; was hovering in the background of his
life, Warren was still willing to take a chance on the great
rollercoaster ride that makes life even more worthwhile.</p>
<p>The song has a similar effect on me to the film <em>Dead Poets' Society</em>,
with its advice to &ldquo;seize the day&rdquo;: it makes me want to grab hold of
life with both hands and hang on for the ride. Because we&rsquo;re only on
this Earth for a short time, we don&rsquo;t get a second chance, and (I
believe) there&rsquo;s nothing afterwards. We may <em>not</em> have this chance again
&mdash; whatever it is &mdash; so let&rsquo;s throw ourselves into it now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three o&rsquo;clock, Four o&rsquo;clock, Five o&rsquo;clock, Six<br>
Let&rsquo;s throw it all into the mix<br>
And open up our bag of tricks,<br>
And party for the rest of the night!</p>

<p>I once saw a guy in the bar on the Saturday night at a con, (I think it was that Eastercon in Docklands) sitting on his own, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wearing a walkman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I want to be here, but it&rsquo;s so hard to get in that I might as well make my own entertainment.&rdquo;  I kind of wanted to ask him to join our group, but I didn&rsquo;t, partly because of my own reticence about approaching a stranger (and fear that I&rsquo;d end up having to babysit a weirdo for the rest of the con, if I&rsquo;m honest) and partly because, of course, the other thing his walkman was saying was, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t want to be saying that, so I&rsquo;ve got all the comment options enabled.  And fortunately I know <!-- raw HTML omitted -->swisstone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->zotz<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  So that&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>My reasons for joining the blogging revolution (not that I need to give any) are: ego (I want to be like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Charlie Stross<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cory Doctorow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doc Searls<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and not wanting to miss out on a bandwagon (if I can paraphrase the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (of Barking): &ldquo;So join the struggle while you may/The Revolution is just a text editor away&rdquo;).</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been meaning to set up a personal website for ages anyway.  And one day I still will.  But in the meantime (and after, in all likelihood) I&rsquo;ll publish anything I want here.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

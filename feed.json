God guides them so they vote for who He has chosen, and it has to be unanimous.</p><p>Whether or not that unanimity requirement was ever really true, I can't say. But that's certainly not how it happens in this film. I imagine this tale is closer to the reality, humans being political beings with preferences and schemes. And God not existing, of course. Or, if 'He' does, certainly not taking that kind of hand in human events.</p><p>I enjoyed this story of the events after an unnamed, imaginary pope's death. It's well acted and beautifully shot. It does have one or two moments that tend to the over-theatrical, let's say.</p><p>But I have to wonder why the filmmakers chose to tell it, and why now. It's an adaptation of Robert Harris's novel from 2016, and could ask the same question of him: why that story, why then?</p><p>And I guess you tell the story you want to tell, and why not?

It seemed unthinkable that Americans would elect Trump again.\n\nBut then, it seemed unthinkable that they would elect him [the first time](https://devilgate.org/2017/01/20/trumpeting.html).[^posts]\n\nWe shouldn't be too surprised though. Among the presidents in my lifetime, we've had Nixon, Reagan, Bush, and W Bush. All of them considered to be dangerous warmongering borderline fascists at the time. And/or comical and incompetent choices, to consider Reagan and W Bush, specifically.\n\nYet America elected all of them (notwithstanding that the popular vote nearly always favoured their Democratic opponent).\n\nTrump, of course, rolls the ills of all of them up into one great ugly package, and adds narcissism on top. And the times could hardly be worse for women in America in particular, with reproductive healthcare under attack with the overturning of <cite>Roe v Wade</cite>.\n\nWhat can you do, though? Life goes on. We'll get through it, except for those of us who don't.\n\n[^posts]: For some reason I couldn't find that post when I wrote this, so I said, 'I'd link to my post from back then, but apparently I didn't make one. Only a [couple](https://devilgate.org/2016/09/23/huffington-trump.html) [before](https://devilgate.org/2016/09/30/trumpschulz.html) the election and [this general one in early 2017](https://devilgate.org/2017/01/02/recent-events.html). Sometimes it's all too much to write about.' But I did write about it, and used the same title as on this post! Oh dear.\n",

And two, since read it in my teenage years and never since, I had shamefully never quite read <em>all</em> of it. Because there&rsquo;s that bit in the middle where Winston is reading &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;, as it&rsquo;s called.

It&rsquo;s a bit odd thinking about it now that the ideology is called &lsquo;<em>English</em> Socialism&rsquo; when the geopolitical bloc Airstrip One is part of, Oceania, is clearly dominated by America.

Still, this would be wholly different, not least because of it being on a giant screen.</p><p>Which was true enough. That screen is almost too big, certainly when you're sitting in row G and there's a closeup: Timothée Chalamet's face shouldn't be gigantic! Luckily there weren't too many of those occasions.</p><p>More to the point, this a spectacular movie, in the literal sense: it's all about the spectacle. And there's plenty of that. Battles, explosions, sandworms, duels.</p><p>And it's all a bit… not that good really, I thought. I liked parts of it. But really disliked the overall narrative arc. As I said last time, I remember the book hardly at all. So the transition of Paul Atriedes from teen duke trying to find his way with the Fremen, to world leader and messiah figure challenging the galactic emperor himself? Frankly, I don't buy it, and I didn't like it.</p><p>My favourite moment was Chani (Zendaya) turning away and walking out when everyone else bowed down to him. In fact in acting terms Zendaya is the best thing about this film. She can express so much just with her face, it was incredible.</p><p>Of course that ability might have been exaggerated by her face being the size of a bus, but no one else was doing that.</p><p>The worst thing about it in a ways was that it didn't feel like the end brought us to a conclusion. It felt like the middle volume of a trilogy. And I'm quite sure the original book didn't feel like that. I know there are several sequels, but I don't believe it was written as the start of a series. It was a self-contained work.</p><p>In fact I started the second one, <cite>Dune Messiah</cite> (and yes, that title should have given me some clues to the above complaints) all those years ago, and couldn't get into it. Didn't finish it.</p><p>The odd thing about all this is that it makes me slightly want to go back and read the book (and maybe carry on this time).</p><p>Anyway, there we are. There had do be someone who didn't think it's the best thing since freshly-baked baguette.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "I didn't know I was writing a trilogy, but here we are.\n\nAfter [finding the mysterious pasta shape last weekend](https://devilgate.org/2024/02/24/well-this-is.html), having [learned about it in early 2021](https://devilgate.org/2021/01/04/a-pasta-mystery.html) from [an article by Rachel Handler](https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/12/2020-bucatini-shortage-investigation.html) in <cite>New York Magazine</cite>, we finally tried it last night.\n\nRachel believes bucatini is 'the only noodle worth eating; all other dry pastas might as well be firewood.' And she describes it as:\n\n> spaghetti but thicker and with a hole in it, meaning it absorbs 200 percent more sauce than its thinner, hole-free brethren, due to math. \n\nRereading the article now, I had forgotten that she did a whole investigation about the shortage, writing it as if it were about a grave conspiracy, and hoping she might be called 'the Bernstein of Bucatini'.\n\nSo what of it? \n\nIt was… fine, I guess? Like spaghetti, but thicker.\n\nBut I fear we might not be getting the real thing. From the photograph accompanying the article, the hole through the noodles looks quite substantial. Whereas in the packet we have — the brand being Tesco Finest — the hole is quite narrow. The <cite>New York</cite> photo might be exaggerating the holiness, but I suspect we're being fobbed off over here, with fakeatini.\n\nCertainly there's no way it collected three times the sauce that standard spaghetti does.\n\nOf course, if you go back to my picture from the other day you'll see that the packet describes it as '**Spaghetti**' in big letters, with 'bucatini' underneath, in much smaller type, like a subtitle.\n\nMaybe, rather than a fake, we have a hybrid.\n",

Unusual, but sometimes quite a good way to approach something. I think I had read something to the effect that someone was invited to someone's country home.

But it would have been better — the conversation afterwards in particular — if the the first twenty minutes and the last five were shaved off.</p><p>The first twenty minutes because, we know: Oxford is shit if you have no friends and no money; and it's better if you have both. We don't need it explained in elaborate detail.</p><p>Or maybe that's not so obvious. I have some insider knowledge there.</p><p>But the last five or so minutes. I mean, really? Do you have to explain everything? Spell everything out in minute detail? Confirm that every possible thing that we thought might have happened — but that was, until now, pleasingly ambiguous — had actually happened?</p><p>I feel like the ending was focus-grouped to death; a few people didn't understand, so they dropped in some tiny flashbacks. Yes, he <em>was</em> that manipulative. I had suspected that from about forty minutes in, and my suspicions only increased.

More shows, even, than when we had <cite>Torchwood</cite> and <cite>The Sarah Jane Adventures</cite>.\n\nTrouble is, from my point of view, that I've lost interest in both <cite>Star Wars</cite> and Marvel exactly because there's _so much stuff_. It's all just too much.\n\nSo I hope my favourite programme doesn't go the same way. Or at least, if it does, that the original programme will always remain at the hearts of the franchise, and not depend on any of the expansion packs.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I picked this up because of the title, taken as it obviously is from an early song by <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/categories/the-clash/\">my favourite band</a>. I bought it because it is set in and around the famous anti-Nazi festival in Victoria Park in London. Or at least it starts there.</p>\n<p>Though that&rsquo;s not quite true. It starts even closer to home for me: my kids' primary school is mentioned early on, and many other streets, pubs, takeaways and landmarks that still exist are visited.</p>\n<p>Joe Thomas was born in 1977, so he&rsquo;s doing this from research, not memory, but it captures the area very well, and the time — well, from what I know of those times in London, I think he&rsquo;s done a great job.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not mainly about the music scene, though. Thomas is a crime writer, and this is, kind of, a crime novel. And becomes more so as it goes on, and jumps to 1983. As you might imagine, given the notoriety of Stoke Newington Police Station of the time, it&rsquo;s about bent coppers. And one more-or-less decent cop who is — we think — trying to bring them down.</p>\n<p>I say &lsquo;We think&rsquo;, because it&rsquo;s not finished. It turns out it&rsquo;s the start of a trilogy, with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Red Menace<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->True Blue<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to follow. This one was only published this year, so I guess it&rsquo;ll be a while before we see the followups.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s all pretty good.

				"content_text": "I picked this up because of the title, taken as it obviously is from an early song by [my favourite band](https://devilgate.org/categories/the-clash/). I bought it because it is set in and around the famous anti-Nazi festival in Victoria Park in London. Or at least it starts there.\n\nThough that's not quite true. It starts even closer to home for me: my kids' primary school is mentioned early on, and many other streets, pubs, takeaways and landmarks that still exist are visited.\n\nJoe Thomas was born in 1977, so he's doing this from research, not memory, but it captures the area very well, and the time — well, from what I know of those times in London, I think he's done a great job.\n\nIt's not mainly about the music scene, though. Thomas is a crime writer, and this is, kind of, a crime novel. And becomes more so as it goes on, and jumps to 1983. As you might imagine, given the notoriety of Stoke Newington Police Station of the time, it's about bent coppers. And one more-or-less decent cop who is — we think — trying to bring them down.\n\nI say 'We think', because it's not finished. It turns out it's the start of a trilogy, with <cite>Red Menace</cite> and <cite>True Blue</cite> to follow. This one was only published this year, so I guess it'll be a while before we see the followups.\n\nIt's all pretty good. It uses a slightly odd, cut-up sort of style: half sentences, fragments ending in dashes. But it's very readable. As I say, I was drawn to it by the music and the locations, but I enjoyed spending time with the characters, and the situation is compelling.

([This Wikipedia article suggests it's a mixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_in_the_Bardo).) But I found them much less interesting than the stories of the dead souls. A few would have been fine, for background, but it feels like they make up about half the book.\n\nMore stories about the dead, please.\n",

But I was there on the first weekend of Black Panther, I was at the opening night of the last Star Wars movie… Neither was as busy as this.</p><p>Oppenheimer was incredible.

I had the vague impression, since I knew only that he'd been instrumental in the Manhattan project, that he was more experimenter than theoretician, maybe an engineer, rather than a physicist. But it turns out (assuming the film and the book it's based on are right) that he was very much a theoretical physicist — even theorising about black holes — and very much not an experimentalist.</p><p>Later 'more politician now than scientist', as one of the many other characters says. And those other characters: so many names from the history of physics, many with parts so small you don't even realise they were there till you look at the cast list. Feynman, for example.</p><p>Heisenberg (I didn't know his politics were so uncertain); Bohr. Einstein, obviously, though he wasn't involved in the Manhattan Project.</p><p>Artistic license: how far were they from the trinity bomb, the initial test detonation? The longest distance they mentioned was twenty miles, for the longest-distance observers, and the closest 1000 yards. That must have been the blast radius, though: there's no way anyone was that close!</p><p>But as represented, the time between the light and the sound seemed ridiculously long.

It&rsquo;s taken me till now to finish it.</p>\n<p>In another sense it&rsquo;s taken me a lot longer: I first started reading it in 2004. Back then I was <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/2005/10/20/postexam-comedown.html\">doing an Open University literature course</a>. In one module an extract from <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780140434279\">Daniel Deronda</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> was one of the options for us to write about. I think I must have chosen it, because my tutor sung its praises, saying it was a great one to read over Christmas, &lsquo;curled up next to the fire.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>So I bought it and started it at the time. I can be fairly sure of this, as the bookmarks I found in it, when I picked it up back in May, were a pair of old-school paper train tickets from 2004. Two markers, of course, because this is a classics edition with comprehensive endnotes.</p>\n<p>The main bookmark was around page 200, so I got a decent way into it. Except this is a book of over 800 pages, so actually not that far. I don&rsquo;t know why I stopped. Probably just got distracted by other books and petered out. I started from the beginning again this time, and found I remembered almost nothing of what I read nearly 20 years ago.</p>\n<p>But enough meta story about my history with the book. What of the book itself?</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s really two main interwoven stories. The title character appears briefly, wordlessly, in the first scene, and then is not seen again for the whole of the first book (it was originally published serially, and is internally divided into eight books). First we get the start of the story of Gwendolen Harleth, a young woman of fair but limited means, who might expect to marry well. Until her family falls into poverty.</p>\n<p>Her story at times feels like it&rsquo;s going to be a conventional, Austenesque romance. It is not, of course: it&rsquo;s much more complex than that.</p>\n<p>The other story is about how Daniel Deronda rescues a young Jewish woman from self-inflicted drowning, and finds her a home, and what follows from that.

				"content_text": "I [mentioned in May](https://devilgate.org/2023/05/29/films-books-blogging.html), that I had been reading this. It's taken me till now to finish it.\n\nIn another sense it's taken me a lot longer: I first started reading it in 2004. Back then I was [doing an Open University literature course](https://devilgate.org/2005/10/20/postexam-comedown.html). In one module an extract from <cite>[Daniel Deronda](https://micro.blog/books/9780140434279)</cite> was one of the options for us to write about. I think I must have chosen it, because my tutor sung its praises, saying it was a great one to read over Christmas, 'curled up next to the fire.'\n\nSo I bought it and started it at the time. I can be fairly sure of this, as the bookmarks I found in it, when I picked it up back in May, were a pair of old-school paper train tickets from 2004. Two markers, of course, because this is a classics edition with comprehensive endnotes. \n\nThe main bookmark was around page 200, so I got a decent way into it. Except this is a book of over 800 pages, so actually not that far. I don't know why I stopped. Probably just got distracted by other books and petered out. I started from the beginning again this time, and found I remembered almost nothing of what I read nearly 20 years ago.\n\nBut enough meta story about my history with the book. What of the book itself?\n\nIt's really two main interwoven stories. The title character appears briefly, wordlessly, in the first scene, and then is not seen again for the whole of the first book (it was originally published serially, and is internally divided into eight books). First we get the start of the story of Gwendolen Harleth, a young woman of fair but limited means, who might expect to marry well. Until her family falls into poverty.\n\nHer story at times feels like it's going to be a conventional, Austenesque romance. It is not, of course: it's much more complex than that.\n\nThe other story is about how Daniel Deronda rescues a young Jewish woman from self-inflicted drowning, and finds her a home, and what follows from that. This section is largely about the way Jews were treated at the time (the 1870s), and the idea that they might seek a homeland. The start of Zionism, in effect. Deronda is sympathetic to the plight of the Jews generally, as he is to Mirah, the woman he rescued. But then, he's synmpathetic to just about everyone.\n\nThe darkest part of this story shows us how terrifyingly restricted, locked down, controlled, a married woman could be in those times. the husband in question is not physically violent, he simply controls all aspects of their lives, and hence her life. She has no hope of escape. It's powerfully understated, and all the more chilling for that.\n\nSome sentences are overly long by modern standards, and some of the language is complex or old-fashioned enough to be confusing, but it usually becomes clear with careful reading. And it doesn't detract from the power of the storytelling. \n\n",

They always included the size, in old-fashioned imperial units: one-inch, two-inch. Probably inch-and-a-half.</p>\n<p>In the early days we wore the big ones. My first one was almost certainly a Beatles one, but I don&rsquo;t remember what design it had. I do recall a glittery Thin Lizzy one, when I went through my period of them being one of my faves. Wings, maybe? Probably.</p>\n<p>Anyway, with punk, the badge size that was considered cool, or even acceptable, reduced. Anything bigger than an inch across would lead to mockery, for sure. Although I think Brendan&rsquo;s Stranglers badge, saying &lsquo;Something Better Change&rsquo; (&lsquo;Because I like the song and I like what it says&rsquo;) was of the two-inch persuasion, but that was in the early days.</p>\n<p>Watty&rsquo;s one, the one that I&rsquo;m talking about: that was probably even earlier. It was white, with the outline of what I had to get quite close to realise was a penny farthing bicycle. And a number: 6.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that about, then?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/158671\"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Prisoner<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>! Do you not know about it?&rsquo; Watty wasn&rsquo;t too bad in this way, but the default reaction to someone being ignorant of something you liked was mockery, back then, when we were 13, 14. To be honest, probably for a decade or more after that, too. Instead of the healthier attempt to infect the ignorant one with our own enthusiasm. Or at least inform them about it.</p>\n<p>I learned, though, that it was a weird programme that was on late at night, and anyway it was over now, so even if it hadn&rsquo;t been on at a time that I wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to stay up on a school night, it was finished, so there was no chance I&rsquo;d ever get to see it.</p>\n<p>Pity.</p>\n<p>Of course, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Prisoner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was originally broadcast in 1967-8, so if Watty was watching it ten years later, it does show that repeats were a thing. If only there were a way we could have our own copies of TV programmes. But what a fantastic, farcical idea!</p>\n<p>I know it was the early days, because the name &lsquo;The Prisoner&rsquo; did not immediately make me think of The Clash. The <a href=\"https://song.link/i/688798635\">B-side</a> of &lsquo;<a href=\"https://song.link/i/647246391\">(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais</a>&rsquo; shares a title with Patrick McGoohan&rsquo;s paranoid cold-war ex-spy drama. I don&rsquo;t think it has anything else in common with it, but you can&rsquo;t be sure.</p>\n<p>I finally saw some episodes in the early nineties. I bought some on VHS, along with my friend Johnny, who also hadn&rsquo;t seen it. But that didn&rsquo;t prove very practical, as we live in different cities. And VHS was expensive. Two episodes per tape for, what fifteen quid? So that petered out.</p>\n<p>Much later I got the DVD box set. And it&rsquo;s been one of the things we&rsquo;ve been watching over the last few months. Er, years, maybe. It might have started in lockdown.</p>\n<p>Tonight we finally watched the last two episodes. Which were much better than I had been led to believe.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s kind of amazing, saturated as it is with sixties fears about mind control, brainwashing, hypnotism. Is anything real after the unnamed main character gets gassed in the opening of the first episode (repeated in the opening credits of almost every episode)? Maybe the whole thing is a hallucination induced by the gas, you know?</p>\n<p>There are certainly plenty of actual induced hallucinations or dreamlike states in the series.

They used to advertise them in the back of <cite>Sounds</cite>, <cite>NME</cite>, <cite>Record Mirror</cite> (and I think there was a fourth member of the British weekly music press, but I can't recall it). They always included the size, in old-fashioned imperial units: one-inch, two-inch. Probably inch-and-a-half.\n\nIn the early days we wore the big ones. My first one was almost certainly a Beatles one, but I don't remember what design it had. I do recall a glittery Thin Lizzy one, when I went through my period of them being one of my faves. Wings, maybe? Probably.\n\nAnyway, with punk, the badge size that was considered cool, or even acceptable, reduced. Anything bigger than an inch across would lead to mockery, for sure. Although I think Brendan's Stranglers badge, saying 'Something Better Change' ('Because I like the song and I like what it says') was of the two-inch persuasion, but that was in the early days.\n\nWatty's one, the one that I'm talking about: that was probably even earlier. It was white, with the outline of what I had to get quite close to realise was a penny farthing bicycle. And a number: 6.\n\n'What's that about, then?'\n\n'It's [<cite>The Prisoner</cite>](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/158671)! Do you not know about it?' Watty wasn't too bad in this way, but the default reaction to someone being ignorant of something you liked was mockery, back then, when we were 13, 14. To be honest, probably for a decade or more after that, too. Instead of the healthier attempt to infect the ignorant one with our own enthusiasm. Or at least inform them about it.\n\nI learned, though, that it was a weird programme that was on late at night, and anyway it was over now, so even if it hadn't been on at a time that I wouldn't have been allowed to stay up on a school night, it was finished, so there was no chance I'd ever get to see it.\n\nPity.\n\nOf course, <cite>The Prisoner</cite> was originally broadcast in 1967-8, so if Watty was watching it ten years later, it does show that repeats were a thing. If only there were a way we could have our own copies of TV programmes. But what a fantastic, farcical idea!\n\nI know it was the early days, because the name 'The Prisoner' did not immediately make me think of The Clash. The [B-side](https://song.link/i/688798635) of '[(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais](https://song.link/i/647246391)' shares a title with Patrick McGoohan's paranoid cold-war ex-spy drama. I don't think it has anything else in common with it, but you can't be sure.\n\nI finally saw some episodes in the early nineties. I bought some on VHS, along with my friend Johnny, who also hadn't seen it. But that didn't prove very practical, as we live in different cities. And VHS was expensive. Two episodes per tape for, what fifteen quid? So that petered out.\n\nMuch later I got the DVD box set. And it's been one of the things we've been watching over the last few months. Er, years, maybe. It might have started in lockdown.\n\nTonight we finally watched the last two episodes. Which were much better than I had been led to believe. \n\nIt's kind of amazing, saturated as it is with sixties fears about mind control, brainwashing, hypnotism. Is anything real after the unnamed main character gets gassed in the opening of the first episode (repeated in the opening credits of almost every episode)? Maybe the whole thing is a hallucination induced by the gas, you know? \n\nThere are certainly plenty of actual induced hallucinations or dreamlike states in the series. Which is why you can't trust the increasingly psychedelic ending. \n\nThe whole thing is a mindfuck. I loved it.\n",

I've been busy with other things.\n\n## Other Things\n\n### Writing a Novel\n\nWhat time I had for writing outside of work, I tried to spend mainly on completing my novel. You'll recall that I did a [Creative Writing MA](https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/) in 2020–21. I graduated in May 2022. My [dissertation](https://devilgate.org/2021/09/17/dissertation-submitted.html) was essentially the first 15,000 words of a novel (along with a preface on how it had all come together). I [promised myself](https://devilgate.org/2022/12/17/at-the-start.html) that I'd finish it by the end of the year. I haven't quite achieved that goal, but I expect to in the next couple of weeks.\n\n### New Job\n\nBut to that 'outside of work', above: I started a new job in February. I never quite got round to writing about it here, except on my [`/now` page](https://devilgate.org/now/), which is an infrequently-maintained page that's meant to say what I'm up to at any time. I was and am glad to have it, of course, but it's amazing how much working 9–5:30 again takes away from your ability to do other things.\n\nThe job itself? I was employed as a Java Developer — that's literally in my job title — and I have written precisely zero lines of Java.\n\nInstead, I found myself plunged into the exciting new world of infrastructure as code, or IaC, and the [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) language. I might write more about that at some point, but in short, it seems I work in [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) now, and I'm enjoying it.\n\n#### Digression: On Writing at Work\n\nI've written over 70,000 words of a novel over the past year-and-a-half or so. But since February I've written something like 100,000 words at work. This comes from keeping copious notes on what I've being doing and what I've learned, and so on. I thank [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for making it easy to do so, and for working in a way that matches how I want to work. But I wonder: why didn't I keep notes like this before? I always wrote things down, of course, but not this systematically, this comprehensively.\n\nIt's a mystery.\n\n### Jury Duty\n\nIn May I spent three weeks on a Jury at [Wood Green Crown Court](https://hornseyhistorical.org.uk/wood-green-crown-court-what-was-there-before/). That was an interesting experience. I might write more about it one day.\n\n### Etc\n\nAnd all the other things that make up life.

I enjoy a crime novel from time to time, and this one certainly kept the pages turning. Backstory was filled in very efficiently, without it feeling like infodumping. And reading about the chill autumn in Scotland (with slight detours into France, the north of England, and Ireland) took the edge off some of the Greek heat.\n\nThe title is a little confusing. There is some art involved in the story, but none of it is a still life. There's at least a double meaning to the phrase, of course, and that makes sense in context. But maybe the French term, _nature mort_, is even more applicable. Not least since Karen Pirie works cold cases for the Scottish police force.\n\t\n",

But Robin Sloan, in his newsletter, which isn&rsquo;t really a newsletter, because he just sends a link to a <a href=\"https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lostthread/\">blog post</a> (with a few added words), says this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An industrialist intends to purchase Twitter, Inc. His substantial success launching reusable spaceships does nothing to prepare him for the challenge of building social spaces. The latter calls on every liberal art at once, while the former is just rocket science.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wanted to quote that because I loved &lsquo;just rocket science.&rsquo; The common expression, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not rocket science&rsquo; has always mildly amused me, as a physics graduate. Because rocket science is <em>relatively</em> both simple and easy. It&rsquo;s straightforward Newtonian physics. Mass. Acceleration. Forces. The physics is simple, the sums are easy.</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go anywhere near even Special Relativity (still straightforward, if harder), General Relativity (much more complex), or of course anywhere close to quantum physics (frankly the most complex and confusing thing of all).</p>\n<p>All of which is just to say that physics has more and less difficult areas. Rocket <em>engineering</em>, of course, is quite another matter. There you&rsquo;ve got all sort of complex materials science, chemistry, end even — if crew are involved — biology, sociology, psychology. Those are <em>much</em> harder.</p>\n<p>As far as common similes for the ease of something go, I&rsquo;ve always preferred &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not brain surgery.&rsquo;  If I think about it I&rsquo;m amazed that operating successfully on a living human brain is even possible, and I bow my head to those who can do it. While hoping they&rsquo;ll never have to go near said bowed object, of course.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that would have been that for this post, except that I pasted the above quote from Sloan into a text editor. But it didn&rsquo;t look like it does above. It looked like this:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>An indus-tri-al-ist intends to pur-chase Twit-ter, Inc. His sub-stan-tial suc-cess launch-ing reusable space-ships does noth-ing to pre-pare him for the chal-lenge of build-ing social spaces. The lat-ter calls on every lib-eral art at once, while the for-mer is just rocket science.\n</code></pre><p>Where did all those hyphens come from? They look like they&rsquo;re non-printing characters. Ones that won&rsquo;t show up when a web page is rendered, but are there in the source code. Why? I can only imagine two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a deliberate ploy to make it harder to copy quotes, as I have done above. But Sloan is a pro-web kinda guy, as far as I can tell. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like something he&rsquo;d do.</li>\n<li>A glitch. An artifact of the software he used to create the post. It&rsquo;s most likely that. Weird one, though.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Stranger still is that the character is not even a hyphen. As I discovered when I search-and-replaced it in BBEdit, it actually appears to be this: <code>\\x{AD}</code>.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that is.

				"content_text": "\nI wasn't going to write anything about Elon Musk buying Twitter, because I mostly don't care. But Robin Sloan, in his newsletter, which isn't really a newsletter, because he just sends a link to a [blog post](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lostthread/) (with a few added words), says this:\n\n>An industrialist intends to purchase Twitter, Inc. His substantial success launching reusable spaceships does nothing to prepare him for the challenge of building social spaces. The latter calls on every liberal art at once, while the former is just rocket science.\n\nI wanted to quote that because I loved 'just rocket science.' The common expression, 'It's not rocket science' has always mildly amused me, as a physics graduate. Because rocket science is _relatively_ both simple and easy. It's straightforward Newtonian physics. Mass. Acceleration. Forces. The physics is simple, the sums are easy. \n\nYou don't have to go anywhere near even Special Relativity (still straightforward, if harder), General Relativity (much more complex), or of course anywhere close to quantum physics (frankly the most complex and confusing thing of all).\n\nAll of which is just to say that physics has more and less difficult areas. Rocket _engineering_, of course, is quite another matter. There you've got all sort of complex materials science, chemistry, end even — if crew are involved — biology, sociology, psychology. Those are _much_ harder.\n\nAs far as common similes for the ease of something go, I've always preferred 'It's not brain surgery.'  If I think about it I'm amazed that operating successfully on a living human brain is even possible, and I bow my head to those who can do it. While hoping they'll never have to go near said bowed object, of course.\n\nAnyway, that would have been that for this post, except that I pasted the above quote from Sloan into a text editor. But it didn't look like it does above. It looked like this:\n\n```\nAn indus-tri-al-ist intends to pur-chase Twit-ter, Inc. His sub-stan-tial suc-cess launch-ing reusable space-ships does noth-ing to pre-pare him for the chal-lenge of build-ing social spaces. The lat-ter calls on every lib-eral art at once, while the for-mer is just rocket science.\n```\n\nWhere did all those hyphens come from? They look like they're non-printing characters. Ones that won't show up when a web page is rendered, but are there in the source code. Why? I can only imagine two reasons:\n\n1. a deliberate ploy to make it harder to copy quotes, as I have done above. But Sloan is a pro-web kinda guy, as far as I can tell. It doesn't seem like something he'd do.\n2. A glitch. An artifact of the software he used to create the post. It's most likely that. Weird one, though.\n\nStranger still is that the character is not even a hyphen. As I discovered when I search-and-replaced it in BBEdit, it actually appears to be this: `\\x{AD}`.\n\nI don't even know what that is. Some kind of hexadecimal representation of something. An invisible hyphen, presumably. Which I had to search-and-replace with actual hyphens to make them visible above. Looking at the source code, it's written as the HTML entity `&shy;`, which the DuckDuck tells me is a 'soft hyphen'.\n\nAll very odd.\n\nI have positive feelings about Sloan, except for his closing image. I'll risk another paste:\n\n> - Wishful descriptions of Twitter as \t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1507777261654605828\">“the de facto public town square”</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1518772753460998145\">“the closest thing we have to a global consciousness”</a> sound, to me, like Peter Pan begging the audience to clap and raise a swooning&nbsp;Tinkerbell.\n>\n> - You don’t have to&nbsp;clap.</p>\n\nYeah, but… of _course_ you have to clap. Without wanting to get all metaphysical on you, if you don't clap when Tinkerbell is dying, you've got no soul.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a strange set of opinions popping up on Twitter over the last week or so, essentially blaming the US, the UK, and/or NATO for Putin&rsquo;s illegal and horrifying war on Ukraine. Which on the face of it is bizarre, at best.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible that NATO&rsquo;s expansion over the last couple of decades was unwise. Yet who could blame small countries close to Russia from seeking the protection that membership brings? Putin&rsquo;s belligerence was well known even before the current attack.</p>\n<p>George Monbiot makes the point well in his excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> piece:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a strong argument that Nato should have been <a href=\"https://socialeurope.eu/what-is-nato-for\">disbanded</a> at the end of the cold war. But while Putin’s sense of threat seems to have been heightened by Nato expansion and mission creep, Nato expansion has also been driven in part by Putin’s belligerence. Are we really to believe that Estonia and Latvia joined because they wanted to attack Russia? On the contrary, it’s because they fear attack. While Nato’s growth is likely to have contributed to the crisis, it’s ridiculous to suggest that Russia is not the aggressor.</p>\n<p>&ndash; George Monbiot, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin\">We must confront Russian propaganda – even when it comes from those we respect</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He suggests that Russian propaganda is at least partly to blame. It seems have made inroads on the left. Monbiot mentions the Stop the War Coalition, which normally we would think is an admirable goal and organisation. But their recent <a href=\"https://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/list-of-signatories-stop-the-war-statement-on-the-crisis-over-ukraine/\">letter</a> claims the British government &lsquo;have poured oil on the fire throughout this episode.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m no supporter of Johnson or the Tories, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair. They also say that they &lsquo;do not endorse the nature or conduct of either the Russian or Ukrainian regimes.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the Ukrainians have done except prepare to defend themselves, and then do so.

				"content_text": "I've seen a strange set of opinions popping up on Twitter over the last week or so, essentially blaming the US, the UK, and/or NATO for Putin's illegal and horrifying war on Ukraine. Which on the face of it is bizarre, at best.\n\nIt's possible that NATO's expansion over the last couple of decades was unwise. Yet who could blame small countries close to Russia from seeking the protection that membership brings? Putin's belligerence was well known even before the current attack.\n\nGeorge Monbiot makes the point well in his excellent <cite>Guardian</cite> piece:\n\n> There is a strong argument that Nato should have been [disbanded](https://socialeurope.eu/what-is-nato-for) at the end of the cold war. But while Putin’s sense of threat seems to have been heightened by Nato expansion and mission creep, Nato expansion has also been driven in part by Putin’s belligerence. Are we really to believe that Estonia and Latvia joined because they wanted to attack Russia? On the contrary, it’s because they fear attack. While Nato’s growth is likely to have contributed to the crisis, it’s ridiculous to suggest that Russia is not the aggressor.\n>\n> -- George Monbiot, [We must confront Russian propaganda – even when it comes from those we respect](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin)\n\nHe suggests that Russian propaganda is at least partly to blame. It seems have made inroads on the left. Monbiot mentions the Stop the War Coalition, which normally we would think is an admirable goal and organisation. But their recent [letter](https://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/list-of-signatories-stop-the-war-statement-on-the-crisis-over-ukraine/) claims the British government 'have poured oil on the fire throughout this episode.' I'm no supporter of Johnson or the Tories, but I don't think that's fair. They also say that they 'do not endorse the nature or conduct of either the Russian or Ukrainian regimes.' \n\nI don't know what the Ukrainians have done except prepare to defend themselves, and then do so. I'm as against war as any former CND member from the eighties, but when a country is invaded, it has a right to fight back.\n\nMonbiot says it well:\n\n> True anti-imperialism means opposing not only the west’s imperialism, essential as this is.

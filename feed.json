It wasn't a problem: getting an earworm of a song I like doesn't bother me. But I wondered what was triggering it.\n\nI can often work out why I get a song in my head.

Rails are placed before it and lifted up behind it so they can be laid in front again. The city is winched along on the rails by fits and starts. Why? Why is it in motion, and why do the inhabitants work desperately to keep it so? And why is the fact kept hidden from city dwellers who are not &lsquo;guildsmen&rsquo;?</p>\n<p>The answers, or some of them, are within. Though there is no answer to why &lsquo;guildsmen&rsquo; is the correct word. Women are second-class citizens in the city.

But no. It turned out definitely not.\n\nA young man learns his place in a city — Earth City, as they call it — which is moving. Rails are placed before it and lifted up behind it so they can be laid in front again. The city is winched along on the rails by fits and starts. Why? Why is it in motion, and why do the inhabitants work desperately to keep it so? And why is the fact kept hidden from city dwellers who are not 'guildsmen'?\n\nThe answers, or some of them, are within. Though there is no answer to why 'guildsmen' is the correct word. Women are second-class citizens in the city. And worse outside it, on the whole.\n\nThe people of the city are human, they speak English mostly. They know their ancestors were from Earth planet, as they refer to it. The people in the villages they pass also seem to be human, and they mostly speak Spanish. The sun appears not as a sphere, but as a kind of disk with spikes top and bottom. What can be going on?

It&rsquo;s in perfect working order, except the battery was past its best. &lsquo;Service recommended,&rsquo; it always said when I checked.

Perhaps less inevitably, but unsurprisingly since it&rsquo;s a manufacturing defect, Apple have long since acknowledged the problem and offered a free repair programme. As long as your machine was no more than four years old.</p>\n<p>I discovered these facts back in the summer. Dug out my receipt. I bought the laptop four years and four days ago. Damn!</p>\n<p>At the time I was deep in working towards <a href=\"/blog/2021/09/17/dissertation-submitted/\">my dissertation</a>, so I wasn&rsquo;t going to spend any more time on it. In September, though, I thought it would be worth contacting Apple support and seeing what could be done. I couldn&rsquo;t get a Genius Bar appointment, but I could take it to an Apple Authorised Service Provider called <a href=\"https://mrsystems.co.uk/pages/contact\">MR in Shoreditch</a>. They had a look at it and said, yes it&rsquo;s the delamination thing, you&rsquo;re outside the free programme, we can fix it: 800 quid.\n{.has-dropcap}</p>\n<p>Too much. But! they also said that it would be worth taking it in to Apple. They might, depending on who you saw, do it for free anyway.</p>\n<p>I was slightly sceptical, and we were getting ready for a trip to Scotland at the time, so I left it. Eventually, though, I booked it into the Genius Bar.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re outside the programme, they said. But we&rsquo;ll fix it under consumer law. No charge.</p>\n<p>The Sale of Goods Act (or its successors) for the win again: a laptop screen should last longer than four years.</p>\n<p>During the tests they run, the guy noticed that the battery was poorly, and offered a replacement. £199 seems steep, so I said no thanks.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I got an email to say it was ready to pick up, so I toddled off to Westfield. The staff member who brought it out to me asked me to wait while she checked something. Came back and said, &lsquo;You know how you rejected the battery replacement? Well it seems they did it anyway.

				"content_text": "\nI have a 15-inch MacBook Pro from 2017. It's in perfect working order, except the battery was past its best. 'Service recommended,' it always said when I checked. But it was fine, I could get a couple of hours out of it, and I rarely use the computer away from somewhere I can plug in. Especially this last couple of years.\n{.has-dropcap}\n\nBut the screen had developed a problem. There were marks on it that I couldn't remove. They were kind of hard to photograph, but you can see them here:\n\n<figure>\n  <a class=\"reference\" href=\"/images/2021-11-05/macbook-stains.jpeg\">\n      <img src=\"/images/2021-11-05/macbook-stains.thumbnail.jpeg\" title=\"MacBook screen with delamination marks\" alt=\"MacBook screen with delamination marks\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n  </a>\n  <figcaption>MacBook screen with delamination marks</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI discovered there was a known defect in models of that era called 'screen delamination.' The top layer of the screen's coating was becoming detached from the underlying one.\n\nPeople had solutions, which involved careful cleaning with various solvents or mild abrasives: isopropyl alcohol, or, I don't know, toothpaste, maybe.[^toothpaste] \n\nInevitably, the whole affair has a 'gate' name: [Staingate](https://boncode.hk/hk/blog/staingate/). Perhaps less inevitably, but unsurprisingly since it's a manufacturing defect, Apple have long since acknowledged the problem and offered a free repair programme. As long as your machine was no more than four years old.\n\nI discovered these facts back in the summer. Dug out my receipt. I bought the laptop four years and four days ago. Damn! \n\nAt the time I was deep in working towards [my dissertation](/blog/2021/09/17/dissertation-submitted/), so I wasn't going to spend any more time on it. In September, though, I thought it would be worth contacting Apple support and seeing what could be done. I couldn't get a Genius Bar appointment, but I could take it to an Apple Authorised Service Provider called [MR in Shoreditch](https://mrsystems.co.uk/pages/contact). They had a look at it and said, yes it's the delamination thing, you're outside the free programme, we can fix it: 800 quid. \n{.has-dropcap}\n\nToo much. But! they also said that it would be worth taking it in to Apple. They might, depending on who you saw, do it for free anyway.\n\nI was slightly sceptical, and we were getting ready for a trip to Scotland at the time, so I left it. Eventually, though, I booked it into the Genius Bar.\n\nYou're outside the programme, they said. But we'll fix it under consumer law. No charge. \n\nThe Sale of Goods Act (or its successors) for the win again: a laptop screen should last longer than four years.\n\nDuring the tests they run, the guy noticed that the battery was poorly, and offered a replacement. £199 seems steep, so I said no thanks.\n\nYesterday I got an email to say it was ready to pick up, so I toddled off to Westfield. The staff member who brought it out to me asked me to wait while she checked something. Came back and said, 'You know how you rejected the battery replacement? Well it seems they did it anyway. We won't charge you.'\n{.has-dropcap}\n\nSo that was weird. The work note that came with it said 'Battery won't charge at all,' which was not true when I took it in. But here I am with a good-as-new battery. Well, _actually_ new.\n\nAll of this required what they call a 'Top case replacement.' 'Top case with battery,' in fact, which suggests the battery is in the screen part of the laptop, not the keyboard part, which seems weird.\n\nThe big downside -- but one that had been prepared for -- is that I lost all my stickers. I had heard of this kind of thing happening, so I took photographs.\n\n<figure>\n  <a class=\"reference\" href=\"/images/2021-11-05/macbook-stickers.jpeg\">\n      <img src=\"/images/2021-11-05/macbook-stickers.thumbnail.jpeg\" title=\"The stickers on my MacBook\" alt=\"The stickers on my MacBook\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n  </a>\n  <figcaption>The stickers on my MacBook</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe questions now are how and whether to replace them.\n\n[^toothpaste]: Don't clean your computer screen with toothpaste.\n\n",

They thought they were going to be cancelled, so JMS tried to tie up most of the loose ends in that season. Then season 5 was saved, and ended up being slow and underpowered by comparison.\n\nFor this proposed reboot -- it's TV, so nothing is definite till it's in the can -- he says he will 'not be retelling the same story in the same way because of what Heraclitus said about the river', but that 'this is a reboot from the ground up rather than a continuation'.\n\nIf anyone else was running it, you could count me out. [Straczynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski) _could_ make it great again, but I sort of wonder why he wants to. Not unlike my wondering about why RTD wants to return to <cite>Who</cite>. I suppose we're never entirely satisfied with our creations, so getting the opportunity to go back and rework them can be tempting. But I'm not sure it's always healthy.\n\nStill, we live in hope.\n",

I've enjoyed being a student again, even though this academic year's particular situation has meant that the experience has been distinctly unlike a classic student one. Even, I'm sure, for Birkbeck, 'London's evening university.' \n\nI have, for example, met none of my classmates in person. I've met exactly one member of staff, and that in the park in [Gordon Square](https://london.ac.uk/about-us/history-university-london/gordon-square). I've never been in the department's building. I've been into any Birkbeck building -- the library -- I think three times, maybe four.\n\nOnline classes have been fine, though. I wonder if creative writing, in its common workshopping format, works especially well over Teams or Zoom. Everyone takes turns to comment on the piece that's being discussed, and there's much less scope for interruptions, compared to in person. Of course the downside of that is that there's less scope for conversation, for organic discussion. So we probably lost out in some ways, too. \n\nLess, though, than students on other courses, and especially first year undergraduates. Like my daughter, who has done a year of uni and met practically no one on her course. It's a strange state of affairs, to be sure.\n\nBut we move on. This novel extract isn't going to dissert itself.\n",

In fact, at least from this I&rsquo;d go further: he <em>believed in the existence</em> of such a dimension. He, I learned, was the originator of the term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract\">tesseract</a>, which &ndash; as I&rsquo;m sure you know &ndash; is the four-dimensional equivalent of a cube.</p>\n<p>So much for that. What of the story? It&rsquo;s interesting, a little odd, and slightly experimental, in terms of its telling. It makes use of letters, diagrams, and other documents from Hinton&rsquo;s life.

				"content_text": "\n\nThe author is one of my [MA](link://category/cwma) supervisors, so take that under advisement, I guess.\n\nThis is a historical novel, based on the real life of Charles Howard Hinton, a Victorian mathematician who studied the idea of a fourth spatial dimension. In fact, at least from this I'd go further: he _believed in the existence_ of such a dimension. He, I learned, was the originator of the term [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract), which -- as I'm sure you know -- is the four-dimensional equivalent of a cube.\n\nSo much for that. What of the story? It's interesting, a little odd, and slightly experimental, in terms of its telling. It makes use of letters, diagrams, and other documents from Hinton's life. But a lot of the really interesting bits of Hinton's life -- his bigamous marriage and being convicted for the same, and subsequent departure for, and time in, Japan, for example -- are told largely offscreen. Or second-hand and partially, via some of those letters.\n\nWhich is all fair enough, but I feel that we didn't really get to know Hinton as a person. I could have done with more of that. In fact we get to know some other members of his family slightly better, as the story's focus changes in the second half.\n\nThe book is split into sections called 'Point,' 'Line,' 'Square,' 'Cube,' 'Tesseract,' 'Cube,' 'Square,' 'Line,' 'Point.' Numbered chapters or subsections, 1 to 14, are included across the first 'Line' and 'Square.' But chapter 9 is missing, or skipped. I kept trying to find some mathematical reason for this -- 9 is a square number, of course, but it's not the only square number in the list, and there's nothing special about 9 in the text, that I noticed.

David Allen Green has been writing about this too, and he avers:[^aver]\n\n> In 2016, American voters (via the electoral college) elected Trump for a term of four years, while those in the United Kingdom voted for Brexit with no similar fixed term.\n>\n> One decision was set to be revisited in four years, the other was not.\n>\n> […]\n>\n> There will be no cathartic Biden-like ceremony to bring Brexit to a close.\n>\n> This is because of the nature of the 2016 referendum (which, unlike the election of Trump, was not a decision for a fixed period); and because of the dynamic structure of the new relationship as set out in the trade and cooperation agreement; and because of the unsettled politics both internally in the United Kingdom and of its relationship with the European Union.\n>\n> And so, to a significant (though not a total) extent, the United States was able to bring what it decided in 2016 to a formal and substantial end, the United Kingdom cannot similarly do so.\n>\n> For the United Kingdom, 2016 is here to stay.\n> \n> -- David Allen Green, [The United States had its cathartic post-2016, post-Trump ceremonial moment – but the United Kingdom cannot have a similar post-2016, post-Brexit moment](https://davidallengreen.com/2021/01/the-united-states-had-its-cathartic-post-2016-post-trump-ceremonial-moment-but-the-united-kingdom-cannot-have-a-similar-post-2016-post-brexit-moment/)\n\nHis 'here to stay,' and my 'forever' could be overstating the case. I feel sure that the United Kingdom, in some form, or at least parts of it, will join the European Union again one day. How far away that day is, and what form the accession country or countries of the time will have, we can only learn by living through it. It will be more than another four years, that's for sure.\n\n[^aver]: As he loves to do. It would be hard to find one of his posts without the word 'aver' in it. I think they get inserted by automatic operation of law.\n\n\tHe also loves a long title: 'The United States had its cathartic post-2016, post-Trump ceremonial moment – but the United Kingdom cannot have a similar post-2016, post-Brexit moment'.\n",

But things still look decidedly dodgy here in the UK.\n",

All that warm, damp air that's condensing on our glasses is _also_ the air that might be carrying virus particles.\n\nSo while this solution helps with the steamed-up glasses problem, it also helps to make masks more effective, by ensuring that more of our potentially-poisonous breath goes through the fabric.\n\n## The Solution\n\nIt's quite simple: apply a strip of micropore tape to the section of the mask that goes over the bridge of your nose, and seal it down well.\n\n<figure>\n  <a class=\"reference\" href=\"/images/2020-12-01/mask-and-micropore.jpeg\">\n      <img src=\"/images/2020-12-01/mask-and-micropore.thumbnail.jpeg\" title=\"Mask and Micropore\" alt=\"A COVID-19-type facemask lying on a surface alongside a roll of micropore tape.\" />\n  </a>\n  <figcaption>Mask and Micropore</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nMicropore tape is normally used for fixing dressings on wounds, so it's designed to stick to skin and come off with minimal fuss (though see below).\n\nThe roll we had when I thought of this is quite wide, so I've been folding a piece over and attaching it to the inside of the mask (at [@FranChats](http://twitter.com/FranChats)'s suggestion).\n\n<figure>\n  <a class=\"reference\" href=\"/images/2020-12-01/mask-with-micropore.jpeg\">\n      <img src=\"/images/2020-12-01/mask-with-micropore.thumbnail.jpeg\" title=\"Mask With Micropore\" alt=\"A COVID-19-type facemask with a piece of micropore tape attached.\" />\n  </a>\n  <figcaption>Mask With Micropore</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAs you can see, it's not attached very tidily, but we're not in this for the aesthetics.\n\n<figure>\n  <a class=\"reference\" href=\"/images/2020-12-01/me-with-mask-with-micropor.jpeg\">\n      <img src=\"/images/2020-12-01/me-with-mask-with-micropor.thumbnail.jpeg\" title=\"Martin With Mask With Micropore\" alt=\"A balding man (the author) wearing a COVID-19-type facemask and glasses.\" />\n  </a>\n  <figcaption>Martin With Mask With Micropore</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAnd it's not actually visible when the mask is on.\n\n## The New Problems: Removal, and Sensitivity\n\nTaking the taped mask off is the worst part, in my experience. I've been doing it quickly: take off my glasses (otherwise they might go flying across the room); unhook the ear loops and take a firm grip of them; close my eyes; then tug sharply forward.[^slowly]\n\nIt can make your eyes water, but honestly, for clear vision outside on these cold days, it's worth it.\n\nRemoving it slowly might be better for some people. And the whole thing will not be for some. If you have very sensitive skin, or get a reaction to the adhesive, then this won't be for you. But if you can take it, I highly recommend it.\n\nLastly, my pictures show a reusable mask, but it works for disposables too.\n\n[^slowly]: Though see [my later post](/blog/2020/12/03/144155/). I think I'll be doing it slowly from now on.\n\n",

We got to choose the genres in which we wanted to be workshopped. I chose SF and crime. Even those of us who aren't being workshopped in a given week have our pieces discussed on the class forum.\n\nSo as you can see, there's quite a lot of reading, analysis, and commenting, as well as actual writing.\n\nI'm enjoying it a lot, but if you were to ask me what I've learned, I'm not sure I could specify that yet. However, the practice, the fact of looking at my own writing and that of others, professionally-published and not, in great detail: that alone is bound to improve my writing, I feel.\n\nRight now it's reading week. I don't recall having such a thing back when I was an undergraduate, but maybe we did. They're standard now, just like half-term breaks at school.[^october] So we have no classes, and some extra short stories to read, and time to catch up on the novels. I finished <cite>Wolf Hall</cite> yesterday, so I only have <cite>The Hate U Give</cite> to read for YA. Plenty of time to get some writing done.\n\nOh, and a couple of homework assignments, too. All work is homework, of course.\n\n[^punctuate]: I'm always confused about how you should punctuate that idiom. I'm asking a question: it needs a question mark. But neither of these look right:\n\n\t* How is it going? you ask.\n\t* How is it going, you ask?\n\t\n\tIt should really be:\n\t\n\t* 'How is it going?' you ask.\n\t\n\tBut that makes it too much like I'm writing dialogue in a a second-person narrative, and it doesn't really fit with the overall feel of a blog post.\n\n\tThe way I've written it above has no question mark at all, and that can't be right.\n\n[^what1]: I've yet to learn what 'Contemporary Writing 1' is, or was, or if there ever was one.\n\n[^notagenre]: I'd argue that YA is a target market, not a genre, but never mind.\n\n[^october]: It was during my primary school years that Scotland introduced the week-long half-term break in October. 'The October Week,' as it was called, and it was definitely a new thing at the time. I was aware of it particularly because my Mum was a primary school teacher. I can't find any evidence of it now, because there are so many other pages about half-term holiday dates and history projects for October half term. But if my memory is not totally faulty, that's the truth of it.\n\n",

It sometimes throws up some oddities, like people I&rsquo;ve never heard of just because they&rsquo;re &lsquo;<a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/06/little-feat/\">featured</a>&rsquo; on something I have. But mostly it&rsquo;s pretty good. It&rsquo;s how I know that Bruce Springsteen has a new album coming out in a few days, for example.</p>\n<p>A few years back I heard a track called &lsquo;Bass Down Low,&rsquo; by someone called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev_(singer)\">Dev</a>. I liked it, both musically and lyrically. I mean, it&rsquo;s not <em>profound</em>, but &lsquo;I like my beats fast and my bass down low&rsquo; is a sentiment I can get behind.</p>\n<p>So there was a new track by Dev out today.

				"content_text": "\n\nA few years ago [I wrote about how I was notified about the wrong band called (The) Nails](/blog/2017/07/19/not-the-nails-im-looking-for/). In that case the names were different, though only by the subtle presence or absence of the definite article. Things have got even more confusing recently.\n\nI have an app on my phone called [Music Harbor](https://apps.Apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750) (sic). The idea is, you give it access to your music library, and it notifies you of forthcoming releases by artists you already have tracks by. It sometimes throws up some oddities, like people I've never heard of just because they're '[featured](https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/06/little-feat/)' on something I have. But mostly it's pretty good. It's how I know that Bruce Springsteen has a new album coming out in a few days, for example.\n\nA few years back I heard a track called 'Bass Down Low,' by someone called [Dev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev_(singer)). I liked it, both musically and lyrically. I mean, it's not _profound_, but 'I like my beats fast and my bass down low' is a sentiment I can get behind.\n\nSo there was a new track by Dev out today. However, the guy rapping on '[El Erb](https://music.Apple.com/gb/album/el-erb-single/1536393357)', is _not_, I feel sure, Dev, the female singer & rapper of 'Bass Down Low.'\n\nIt's also a scunner of a name to search for, what with it being an abbreviation for developer, [the TV show](https://devilgate.org/blog/2020/09/03/on-devs/), and Google completely owning the `.dev` top-level domain.\n\nMultiple people with the same name: it's a problem. It's why actors have [Equity names](https://www.equity.org.uk/about/equity-name/), I guess.\n\nStill, there should be no problem with the early nineties [Scottish indiepoppers Bis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bis_(Scottish_band)), right? Who'd have thought they'd be back with a new single, this long after 'The Secret Vampire EP'?\n\nNo-one, it turns out. This Bis is someone else (and his single '[Streets](https://music.Apple.com/gb/album/streets/1536096221?i=1536096222)' is also nothing to do with [The Streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Streets)).[^bis1] It's also hard to search for, not least because it's an abbreviation for several different organisations. I even used to work for a company called BIS.\n\nI don't think the English language is running out of names, but if you're planning on using a short one as your professional persona or brand, you probably want to check out whether or not someone has already used it in your field. Though it's not always that\neasy, as I've noted. \n\nThere's even a music magazine called <cite>[Clash](https://clashmusic.com)</cite>, which has nothing to do with [The Clash](https://www.theclash.com/).\n\nStill, 'Sugar sugar kandy pop/Push it down and pull it up,' as I'm sure we can all agree.\n\n\n[^bis1]: Shit, and I've just found out [he was murdered](https://www.nme.com/news/music/drill-rapper-bis-killed-knife-attack-london-2584781) last year.\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Announcing a big life change: I&rsquo;m going to be starting a masters course in a couple of weeks. An <a href=\"http://www.bbk.ac.uk/study/2020/postgraduate/programmes/TMACWRIT_C\">MA in Creative Writing, at Birkbeck, University of London</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"nine-months-in-slippers\">Nine Months in Slippers</h1>\n<p>&ldquo;How did you get here, Martin?&rdquo; I hear you ask. Let me take you back to November last year. I lost my job. The reasons are obscure and not that interesting, but I had been working at <a href=\"https://www.spika.com\">SPIKA</a> for only six months, and suddenly I was out on the street.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>If that had happened a couple of months sooner, I might have been studying all this time. I had been vaguely musing on the idea of doing a masters in journalism. I love to write, and I sometimes think that I kind of missed a calling.</p>\n<p>I was too late for 2019, all the university terms having already started. So I did a bit of job hunting, but mainly took a break till after Christmas.</p>\n<p>When this year that we had no idea was going to be so terrible started, I started looking for jobs, but I also kept thinking about journalism. I started a distance-learning course. Learned a bit of shorthand, and read up on some of the other aspects of the craft. A journalism MA, starting this year, was still on the table.</p>\n<p>Then Coronavirus arrived.</p>\n<p>To be honest, the lockdown didn&rsquo;t change things that much for me: I was at home all the time anyway. But the jobs market, as well as the rest of the world, was affected. It&rsquo;s easy to work from home in software development, but recruitment was down. I had a few interviews, but no success.</p>\n<p>Then somewhere in there I decided that journalism wasn&rsquo;t for me after all. There are aspects of the profession that didn&rsquo;t appeal to me: newsgathering and all that side of it, essentially. I&rsquo;d like to be a columnist or maybe a feature writer, but not so much a reporter. Perhaps more importantly, it&rsquo;s a terrible time for journalism, with newsrooms laying people off and cutting back.</p>\n<p>I kept looking for jobs back in software development. But after a bit, Frances said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do a masters in your own field?&rdquo; It was a good idea: it would be intellectually stimulating, and possibly improve my employability. I started looking at courses.</p>\n<p>Computer science itself (I&rsquo;ve never formally studied it), or one of the various data science options? Both had their merits. Either would have been interesting and mentally challenging.</p>\n<p>But they didn&rsquo;t <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/e/what-does-marie-kondo-mean-when-she-says-spark-joy/\">spark joy</a>, to use a tidiness-related term that <a href=\"https://www.becomingminimalist.com/does-it-spark-joy-is-the-wrong-decluttering-question/\">seems appropriate</a>. I looked at the course outlines, and they were interesting enough, but I could tell I wouldn&rsquo;t have <em>loved</em> doing them.</p>\n<p>There were other subjects, though, and one kept prodding my mind; one that <em>did</em> offer the prospect of joy, the possibility that I would love it.</p>\n<p>Like I said, I love to write.</p>\n<h1 id=\"choosing\">Choosing</h1>\n<p>Quite a few institutions offer creative writing MAs, in various forms. I applied to all of them. All the ones in London, anyway, and a few others that offer distance learning. Each needed a personal statement and a sample of writing. Every single one had unique requirements of the sample, in terms of word length and type of piece. Royal Holloway, for example (who rejected me), wanted a short story extract and, uniquely, a piece of critical writing. Most just wanted the fiction.</p>\n<p>There were differences in the course titles, too. London Met&rsquo;s was &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.londonmet.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/creative-digital-and-professional-writing---ma/\">Creative, Digital, and Professional Writing</a>.&rsquo; Westminster&rsquo;s was &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.westminster.ac.uk/english-and-creative-writing-courses/2020-21/january/full-time/creative-writing-writing-the-city-ma\">Creative Writing: Writing the City</a>,&rsquo; though they had closed entry for this year.</p>\n<p>City, University of London has several. But the plain &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/creative-writing\">Creative Writing</a>&rsquo; was showing a message to the effect of &lsquo;Applications suspended.&rsquo; I emailed to ask if this meant that they were full for the year, and was told that no, they had suspended entry for 2020 because there wasn&rsquo;t enough interest. So I applied for another one they have, &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/creative-writing-and-publishing\">Creative Writing and Publishing</a>.&rsquo; They got back to me after a few days and said the course was full. Seems to be a slight disconnect there, maybe?</p>\n<p>I got offers from London Met, <a href=\"https://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/creative-writing-distance-learning-ma/\">Kingston</a> (by distance learning), and Birkbeck. Birkbeck were the only ones who interviewed me first (I still haven&rsquo;t heard back from several, and Glasgow&rsquo;s website was too broken to let me apply &ndash; and they didn&rsquo;t reply to my query). And just today, <a href=\"https://www.tees.ac.uk/postgraduate_courses/English_&amp;_Creative_Writing/MA_Creative_Writing_(Online).cfm\">Teeside, another distance learning one</a>, offered me a place. Far, far too late.

				"content_text": "\n\n\n\nAnnouncing a big life change: I'm going to be starting a masters course in a couple of weeks. An [MA in Creative Writing, at Birkbeck, University of London](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/study/2020/postgraduate/programmes/TMACWRIT_C).\n\n# Nine Months in Slippers\n\n\"How did you get here, Martin?\" I hear you ask. Let me take you back to November last year. I lost my job. The reasons are obscure and not that interesting, but I had been working at [SPIKA](https://www.spika.com) for only six months, and suddenly I was out on the street.[^fn1]\n\nIf that had happened a couple of months sooner, I might have been studying all this time. I had been vaguely musing on the idea of doing a masters in journalism. I love to write, and I sometimes think that I kind of missed a calling.\n\nI was too late for 2019, all the university terms having already started. So I did a bit of job hunting, but mainly took a break till after Christmas.\n\nWhen this year that we had no idea was going to be so terrible started, I started looking for jobs, but I also kept thinking about journalism. I started a distance-learning course. Learned a bit of shorthand, and read up on some of the other aspects of the craft. A journalism MA, starting this year, was still on the table.\n\nThen Coronavirus arrived.\n\nTo be honest, the lockdown didn't change things that much for me: I was at home all the time anyway. But the jobs market, as well as the rest of the world, was affected. It's easy to work from home in software development, but recruitment was down. I had a few interviews, but no success.\n\nThen somewhere in there I decided that journalism wasn't for me after all. There are aspects of the profession that didn't appeal to me: newsgathering and all that side of it, essentially. I'd like to be a columnist or maybe a feature writer, but not so much a reporter. Perhaps more importantly, it's a terrible time for journalism, with newsrooms laying people off and cutting back.\n\nI kept looking for jobs back in software development. But after a bit, Frances said, \"Why don't you do a masters in your own field?\" It was a good idea: it would be intellectually stimulating, and possibly improve my employability. I started looking at courses.\n\nComputer science itself (I've never formally studied it), or one of the various data science options? Both had their merits. Either would have been interesting and mentally challenging.\n\n But they didn't [spark joy](https://www.dictionary.com/e/what-does-marie-kondo-mean-when-she-says-spark-joy/), to use a tidiness-related term that [seems appropriate](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/does-it-spark-joy-is-the-wrong-decluttering-question/). I looked at the course outlines, and they were interesting enough, but I could tell I wouldn't have _loved_ doing them. \n\nThere were other subjects, though, and one kept prodding my mind; one that _did_ offer the prospect of joy, the possibility that I would love it.\n\nLike I said, I love to write. \n\n# Choosing\n\nQuite a few institutions offer creative writing MAs, in various forms. I applied to all of them. All the ones in London, anyway, and a few others that offer distance learning. Each needed a personal statement and a sample of writing. Every single one had unique requirements of the sample, in terms of word length and type of piece. Royal Holloway, for example (who rejected me), wanted a short story extract and, uniquely, a piece of critical writing. Most just wanted the fiction.\n\nThere were differences in the course titles, too. London Met's was '[Creative, Digital, and Professional Writing](https://www.londonmet.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/creative-digital-and-professional-writing---ma/).' Westminster's was '[Creative Writing: Writing the City](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/english-and-creative-writing-courses/2020-21/january/full-time/creative-writing-writing-the-city-ma),' though they had closed entry for this year.\n\nCity, University of London has several. But the plain '[Creative Writing](https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/creative-writing)' was showing a message to the effect of 'Applications suspended.' I emailed to ask if this meant that they were full for the year, and was told that no, they had suspended entry for 2020 because there wasn't enough interest. So I applied for another one they have, '[Creative Writing and Publishing](https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/creative-writing-and-publishing).' They got back to me after a few days and said the course was full. Seems to be a slight disconnect there, maybe?\n\nI got offers from London Met, [Kingston](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/creative-writing-distance-learning-ma/) (by distance learning), and Birkbeck. Birkbeck were the only ones who interviewed me first (I still haven't heard back from several, and Glasgow's website was too broken to let me apply -- and they didn't reply to my query). And just today, [Teeside, another distance learning one](https://www.tees.ac.uk/postgraduate_courses/English_&amp;_Creative_Writing/MA_Creative_Writing_(Online).cfm), offered me a place. Far, far too late. I shouldn't criticise, though, since I was very late in applying.\n\nFor a variety of reasons I decided Birkbeck was the best of the offers, not least that I liked [Julia Bell](https://www.juliabell.net), the course leader, who interviewed me from her shed. Birkbeck is 'London's evening university.' It was set up to provide adult education to people who are working. All the classes are in the evenings. \n\n# Why, and Why Now?\n\nThis is probably something I should have done thirty years ago, but we didn't know about masterses back then. Well, I didn't, anyway. And I don't think creative writing masters courses existed at all.[^fn2] Anyway, as the saying more or less has it, the best time was then; the second-best time is now.\n\nWill it help me be a better writer? I damn well hope so. Beyond that, we'll have to wait and see.\n\n# And Beyond…\n\nWhat comes after this? In an ideal world I'll make my living as a writer. I'm well aware how hard that is to achieve, though, so I might end up going back to programming. The best might be some sort of hybrid. We'll see, but I'm not going to worry too much about it for the next year or so.\n\nOne thing I do plan to do is to blog about the course as I do it, so expect to see more here.\n\n[^fn1]: Specifically Victoria Street, Westminster. It was a very convenient office for [popping down to Parliament Square to protest illegal proroguing](/blog/2019/09/04/5832/).\n\n[^fn2]: [A little research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEA_Creative_Writing_Course) tells me the famous UEA one started in 1970, so I'm wrong there.\n\n",

That may have been signalled by the recent decision to cut 180 jobs (or 12% of its UK workforce) as a result of Covid.\n<br />\n...\n<br />\nBut, tellingly, newsstand print sales, at £49.3m, were 50% down compared with 2016. Last year, print accounted for 42% of revenue (£94 million) and an estimated £75 million of production, distribution and marketing costs. So, the printed newspaper may last year have delivered almost £20m of real profit. But now Covid is pushing it into losses from which it may not be able to recover – without dramatic change.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\nInteresting and unsurprising to learn that Saturday is (was?) its biggest day for print sales:\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"The Guardian to end print? - Flashes & Flames\" data-author=\"\" cite=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/?utm_source=Daily+Lab+email+list&utm_campaign=03c6c90989-dailylabemail3&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d68264fd5e-03c6c90989-396542471\">\nLike most UK national newspapers, The Guardian has been highly profitable on Saturdays because of higher prices and sales volumes. Pre-Covid, The Guardian had been selling 100,000 copies at £2.20 on weeekdays. But, on a Saturday, it was selling 246,000 copies at £3.20 – and with more advertising revenue too.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/?utm_source=Daily+Lab+email+list&utm_campaign=03c6c90989-dailylabemail3&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d68264fd5e-03c6c90989-396542471\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/?utm_source=Daily+Lab+email+list&utm_campaign=03c6c90989-dailylabemail3&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d68264fd5e-03c6c90989-396542471</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter [our local newsagent stopped delivering](/blog/2019/09/11/the-end-of-newspaper-delivery/) the Saturday <cite>Guardian</cite>, we went out and bought it most weeks... until Covid and the lockdown.

Much of the experience (especially of the Newhouse family’s Advance newspaper group in the US) seems to show that reducing the daily frequency seldom works: once the daily habit is broken, newspaper buyers quickly seem to stop buying the paper altogether. A consolation print option could be the expansion of the 101-year-old news magazine Guardian Weekly which claims readers in more than 170 countries.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\nI'd guess they'll maybe keep <cite>The Observer</cite> going for a while: Sunday papers have their own distinct identities.\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"The Guardian to end print? - Flashes & Flames\" data-author=\"\" cite=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">\nThe contrast with digital could not be greater. The Guardian has 160 million monthly uniques across the world, some 25% in the UK. More striking, though, are those digital editions in North America and Australia/New Zealand which, respectively, have advertising revenue of £25 million and £11 million. These are now strong operations, evidenced by Australia where The Guardian is the fourth largest online news service with an audience of 11.6 million (more than 50% of the adult population) – ahead of News Corp’s national daily, The Australian.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\nGood to know it's beating Murdoch on his home turf.\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"The Guardian to end print? - Flashes & Flames\" data-author=\"\" cite=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">\nHarvard’s Nieman Journalism Lab describes The Guardian as “a weird newspaper” because: it has nearly two-thirds of its readers coming from outside its own country; started in one city and moved to another; and is owned by a trust that mandates it promotes liberal journalism in Britain and elsewhere.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n\"A weird newspaper\": works for me.\n\n\n\n",

				"content_text": "\n\nThis has been sitting around in my drafts folder for about a month, so it's long past time to get it out there.\n\n[HEY](https://hey.com) (they always capitalise it, which I don't care for) is a new email service from [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com), makers of fine (I’m told) collaboration software for teams. [The video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI) lasts about half an hour, but/and gives you a good overview of what it’s like.\n\nHey was also in the news recently over the way Apple was treating it regarding App Store rules. Apple were clearly in the wrong, and things have been sorted out now.\n\nBut that’s all another story. I want to talk about Hey, and why I think it is bad for users. Even at the same time that it’s probably _good_ for users. A company, a service, can — like a person — contain multitudes.\n\n## The Good\n\nIf you watch that video you’ll see that Hey looks like an unusually interesting and capable email client: good for organising mail, getting the unimportant stuff out of your way until you want to look at it, and making the important things highly visible. It’s both powerful at automatically helping the user, and attractive to look at.\n\n## The Bad\n\nBut it’s built on a proprietary platform. Email’s biggest strength since its invention has been that it was built on open standards. Whether you were using a Unix command-line client at a university in the early days, or Gmail, Outlook, or another IMAP provider today — none of that matters. If you know someone’s email address, you can contact them, and they you. And more importantly for this discussion: if you want to use different email client software, you can. \n\nThat’s because email is built on _[open protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Protocol)_: SMTP, POP, and [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol). Not that you have to understand those -- or even know about them -- to use email, any more than you have to understand an internal combustion engine to drive a car.\n\nMore importantly, if you want to change from one email provider to another, you can do so. This is harder than it should be because the culture of people having their own domain never really caught on. All those `josmith1989@gmail.com` and `hazy_harriet@hotmail.com` type of addresses could, instead, have been `jo@josmith1989.net` and `harri@hazyharriet.org`. \n\nThey still could be, in fact. And when they are, then you can change the underlying email provider without anyone other than yourself having to know or care. To take a not-made-up example, `martin@devilgate.org` used to go by a complex combination of Gmail (for the spam filtering and search) and `5quidhost.co.uk` and its eventual purchaser, TSOHost, because that’s what I used for web hosting, as much as anything else. But a few years ago I switched it to [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/). No-one I correspond with had to know anything about the change.\n\t\nBut Hey’s email service does not use the open protocols — principally IMAP — that makes all that possible.

				"content_text": "\n\nOut to the supermarket today, because we were running low on a few things and our next delivery isn't arriving till Monday. It's the first time I've been out -- except to the back garden -- since the [bike incident](/blog/2020/04/07/the-last-bike-ride/). Admittedly that was only four days ago, but like everything now, it feels a lot longer.\n\nAnd I felt some trepidation about it. The world's a dangerous place: the very _air_ is dangerous, depending on who you get close to. And some you can't avoid, because pavements have a finite width, and some people _still_ walk blithely two-abreast, or on their own but down the middle... honestly, people, keep your distance.\n\nIn keeping with my [recent exhortation](/blog/2020/04/02/wear-a-mask-and-celebrate-your-immune-system/), I wore a mask. Just a bandana, but as I said there, anything is better than nothing. And hey, it reminded me of The Clash in the [\"Bankrobber\" video](https://youtu.be/ttJBdr6eBuo).\n\nSainsbury's was fine.

This is contrary to what we were told initially, but it makes complete sense even without technical analysis. <em>Anything</em> coming between someone else’s droplets and your lungs, or your droplets and someone else’s lungs, is better than <em>nothing</em> coming between them.</p>\n<p>It’s like wearing a cycling helmet: I’ve always thought that something between my head and the ground, should I come off, is better than nothing.</p>\n<p>And there are <a href=\"https://ragmask.com\">designs online for making masks</a> out of any old cloth. I feel <em>#blessed</em> that my daughter has an A-level in textiles and a sewing machine.</p>\n<p>On the question of masks, though, something has been confusing me since this all started. And to an extent, before that, really, when I’d occasionally see people out and about wearing what appeared to be a hospital-style mask. Which is, where did people get such things? How did they come to have what looked like professional medical supplies in their private possession? Aren’t these things <em>controlled</em>?</p>\n<p>Clearly not, for the last one. And I wondered <em>why</em>? Why did people have them? Now, that seems like a foolish question. And it ignores the cultural differences, whereby in parts of Asia it’s considered rude not to wear a mask if you are sick. Makes sense, though I always wonder how horrible it is if you sneeze while wearing one.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-6473-Rorschach\">\n“We’re not trapped in here with the coronavirus.

I don’t understand why, but cultures are different.</p>\n<p>Unlike <cite>Flights</cite>, it’s a complete, single story. It’s also much simpler. The narrator is an interesting character, though her practice of astrology adds nothing to the story and gets in its way to an extent.</p>\n<p>Each chapter has a quote from Blake as an epigraph.

They were yellow and they appeared on the front doors of houses. They said things such as DIPHTHERIA and SCARLET FEVER and WHOOPING COUGH. Milkmen – there were still milkmen in those years, sometimes with horse-drawn wagons – and bread men, ditto, and even icemen, and certainly postmen (and yes, they were all men), had to leave things on the front doorsteps. We kids would stand outside in the snow – for me, it was always winter in cities, as the rest of the time my family was up in the woods – gazing at the mysterious signs and wondering what gruesome things were going on inside the houses. Children were especially susceptible to these diseases, especially diptheria – I had four little cousins who died of it – so once in a while a classmate would disappear, sometimes to return, sometimes not.\n</p></blockquote>\n</body></html>\n",

It looked like this at about noon:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3608-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3608-1-scaled.jpeg\" class=\"aligncenter size-full\" alt=\"IMG 3608\" width=\"1857\" height=\"1392\" title=\"IMG_3608.jpeg\"></a></p>\n<p>The Levis shop was open. I was picking up some jeans that had been in for repair. That’s a good note for when this is all over, incidentally. If your Levis wear into holes or get torn, most of their shops offer a repair service now. They may have done for years; I only learned about it a month or so back. But it means that for significantly less than a new pair of jeans, I have <em>two</em> good-as-new pairs, including the ones which were <em>already</em> my favourites. One antidote to fast fashion.</p>\n<p>There was almost no-one around, and no-one was getting very close to anyone. In Lakeland I was able to get a refill (really, replacement) for one of our SodaStream CO<sub>2</sub> cylinders. But they didn’t have any new ones. It seems unlikely that those have been panic-bought, but <em>I</em> was thinking of getting an extra one in case it becomes hard to get replacements, so others might have been ahead of me.</p>\n<p>In and out within half an hour, and the parking was the least I’ve ever paid at Westfield: £3. I wouldn’t normally drive if I wasn’t buying much, but getting on the Overground would have been the opposite of social distancing.</p>\n<p>Or maybe not, if it had been as empty as the mall.</p>\n<p>But just yesterday I gave my daughter a lift to a friend’s house — same idea, avoid the bus — and up in Stamford Hill at around 4:30pm it was really busy with pedestrians. A lot of cars on the road, too. Maybe that was normal or less than, for that time on a Tuesday, though.</p>\n<p>Dropped into the wee Sainsbury’s on the way back. No fresh fruit or veg at all. Most tinned goods and bread gone — no toilet rolls, obviously — plenty of snacks and crisps, surprisingly. Either panic-buyers prefer healthy options, or Sainsbury’s are quicker at getting unhealthy supplies back.</p>\n<p>I have to confess to feeling a small amount of smugness at having stocked up over the last year or so. Brexit was the initial trigger, but I soon realised that having a supply of non-perishable items is actually pretty useful. If you can afford to buy a bit extra from time to time, and you’ve got the space to store it all, of course.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, meals are going to get dull really fast without a regular supply of fresh things.</p>\n<p>But if that’s the most we have to worry about, we’re doing better than many. I hope you are coping OK, dear reader.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I heard of this book — <a href=\"http://www.hpmor.com\">HPMOR</a>, as it’s known — from my son, a couple of years ago. Didn’t think about it for a while, and then recently I saw a tweet from a friend-of-friends, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ciphergoth\">@ciphergoth</a>:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The correct quote is \"There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/n3qAmdyhV2\">https://t.co/n3qAmdyhV2</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Agxq7FruRk\">pic.twitter.com/Agxq7FruRk</a></p>\n<p>— Paul Crowley (@ciphergoth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ciphergoth/status/1222276296492769280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The fact that it was a quote from Harry Potter, and that I didn’t recognise it — indeed, it didn’t seem like something Harry would say  — intrigued me, so I clicked through.</p>\n<p>And then I shortly found myself downloading the ebook and reading it for the next… actually, month or so.</p>\n<p>Because this book is <em>looooooong</em>! It’s a retelling of just the <em>first</em> Harry Potter book, along with much more, and it’s about half as long as all seven of the JKR originals.</p>\n<p>In fact, it could have done with an editor. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it has some weaknesses.</p>\n<p>First, the strengths, though. Yudkowsky can write a page-turner almost as well as Rowling. What we have here is an alternative universe in which Petunia Evans marries someone else, not Vernon Dursley. They adopt Harry, and bring him up in a loving home. Harry’s adoptive father is a scientist, which is where he learns his rationality. So his first thought when he discovers that magic exists is to try experiments to understand its capabilities and limits. Experimentation soon gets overwhelmed by events, though, as the plot gets going.</p>\n<p>There are other differences from the original, of course, and the end result is very different.</p>\n<p>Part of what Yudkowsky does is takes the literal translation of Voldemort’s name — “flees from death,” essentially — recognises the rationality of that feeling — who wouldn’t prefer going on living, to dying? — and builds from there.</p>\n<p>The major flaws are wordiness and couple of authorial tics that get repetitive and mildly annoying. He has a tendency to refer to people by their role, rather than their name: “The Defence Professor,” rather than “Quirrell,” for example. Which is fine if used sparingly, for variety. But he has people referring to other people like that, when they just wouldn’t.</p>\n<p>There’s also overuse of  scenes that start like, “The boy stood in the forest…” and only slowly revealing <em>which</em> boy. Again, fine occasionally, but he overdoes it.</p>\n<p>And a few Americanisms creep in: like calling the staff of Hogwarts the “faculty.” And anachronisms: nobody apologised for their snarkiness in 1992, since the word hadn’t been coined yet. Well, I could be wrong there: <a href=\"https://www.wordnik.com/words/snarky\">this site says</a> it goes back to 1906 or earlier. No-one in Britain, then.</p>\n<p>But I shouldn’t complain. It’s an astonishingly well-constructed work, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

When I saw the trailer (I think back in December, when we saw Knives Out) I was a bit freaked out by it. What’s this, you’ve got a film about a kid in the Hitler Youth, with Hitler as a character, and they seem to be playing it for comedy? This looks well dodgy.</p><p>My kids knew it was by Taika Waititi , though, and that seemed to make it likely to be OK? I dunno, but eventually I decided to give it a chance.</p><p>And it turns out to be really good. A sweet film in many ways, though with plenty of menace and darkness, as you'd expect from where and when it's set -- which is an unnamed German town or city in the dying days of the Second World War. Waititi himself plays Hitler, who is not in fact the real one, but an imaginary friend that lets Jojo, the ten-year-old title character, talk to someone about the things he can't talk to anyone else about.</p><p>So I enjoyed it, but I can't help asking: why did he choose to make this film? Why that story, why now? It's based on a novel, Caging Skies by Christine Leunens. But Wikipedia's description of it as \"the internationally bestselling Hitler Youth novel\" leaves me none the wiser.</p><p>Not, of course, that there has to be a specific reason for a creator to make something. And it's far from the first comedy about Hitler or the Nazis. But there's just something about the idea of it -- not the actuality -- that leaves me a little uncomfortable, in a way that The Great Dictator or The Producers didn't.</p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/devilgate/film/jojo-rabbit/\">See in Letterboxd</a></p>\n",

				"title": "The Memory Police by Yōko Ogawa (Books 2020, 2)",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Translated by Stephen Snyder. I asked for this for Christmas, because I saw it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/20/the-memory-police-yoko-ogawa-review\">reviewed</a> in <cite>The Guardian</cite> and it sounded interesting. And it is, but I had some problems with it.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the blurb:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <strong>Hat ribbon, bird, rose.</strong><br>\n  <br>\n  To the people on the island, a disappeared thing no longer has any meaning. It can be burned in the garden, thrown in the river or handed over to the Memory Police. Soon enough, the island forgets it ever existed.<br>\n  <br>\n  When a young novelist discovers that her editor is in danger of being taken away by the Memory Police, she desperately wants to save him. For some reason, he doesn’t forget, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to hide his memories. Who knows what will vanish next?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That “[f]or some reason” is where this book doesn’t quite work for me. The setup is fine: a type of item, and the memories, the very <em>idea</em> of that item, disappears. The titular police make sure that all instances of the item — roses, hats, photographs… — are removed. But some people keep their memories and the ideas, and try to keep the things. The Memory Police find them and cart them off.</p>\n<p>The protagonist’s mother was taken in that way when the protagonist was small.<sup id=\"fnref-6249-names\"><a href=\"#fn-6249-names\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Why is it happening? <em>How</em> is it happening? Who are the Memory Police, and what happens to the people they take? Can they be resisted, and how can the islanders get their memories back? These are the sorts of questions you would expect to have answered, were this a science fiction novel. Are the islanders the victims of some sort of mind-control experiment? Are they in a simulation?</p>\n<p>This is not a science fiction novel.</p>\n<p>“For some reason”. Don’t read this expecting to find out what the reason is, or to get answers to any of the other questions.</p>\n<p>All that said, I enjoyed reading it. The sense of danger, of menace, is palpable, but subtle. It’s about people trying to live their lives under these bizarre conditions. It’s just frustrating thinking about it now, about the unanswered questions.</p>\n<p>But maybe I’m reading it wrong. In her essay “<a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2010/01/18/sf-reading-protocols/\">SF reading protocols</a>,” Jo Walton writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  A reviewer wanted to make the zombies in Kelly Link’s “Zombie Contingency Plans” (in the collection <cite><a href=\"http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/titledetail.cfm?titleNumber=1185675\">Magic For Beginners</a>)</cite> into metaphors. They’re not. They’re actual zombies. They may also be metaphors, but their metaphorical function is secondary to the fact that they’re actual zombies that want to eat your brains. Science fiction may be literalization of metaphor, it may be open to metaphorical, symbolic and even allegorical readings, but what’s real within the story is real within the story, or there’s no there there. I had this problem with one of the translators of my novel <cite>Tooth and Claw</cite>—he kept emailing me asking what things represented. I had to keep saying no, the characters really were dragons, and if they represented anything that was secondary to the reality of their dragon nature. He kept on and on, and I kept being polite but in the end I bit his head off—metaphorically, of course.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The essay is largely about how there is a “toolkit” for reading SF — a set of understandings, of tropes — without which some can find the genre  difficult to understand. We learn that toolkit, or build it, from early reading of the genre. But she follows the above quote with this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  When I read literary fiction, I take the story as real on the surface first, and worry about metaphors and representation later, if at all. It’s possible that I may not be getting as much as I can from literary fiction by this method, in the same way that the people who want the zombies and dragons to be metaphorical aren’t getting as much as they could.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe that’s what went wrong for me with <cite>The Memory Police</cite>: Ogawa wrote a metaphorical work — about people trying to live their lives under bizarre conditions, as I wrote above. I read it with the expectation that the bizarre conditions would have an explanation, and they don’t, because they are “only” metaphors.</p>\n<p>For, I would have to suppose, a totalitarian state, where the slightest infraction of arcane and obscure laws leads to being carted away by the secret police.</p>\n<p>We also get sections of the novel the protagonist is writing. It is about a woman who loses her voice, and communicates using a typewriter. Then the typewriter is taken away from her. It works as a metaphor for the situation the protagonist lives in: a metaphor within a metaphor.</p>\n<p>And from the <cite>Guardian</cite> review that started this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  Why this is happening is unknown; the ideology of totalitarian control and cultural isolation is implied, rather than explicitly outlined, and its intersection with the supernatural strengthens the feeling of allegory.\n</blockquote>\n<p>So maybe I should have been warned. Calling it “supernatural” suggests something more in the magic realism vein. That might be a better way to approach it. Magic needs — or at least, generally gets — less of an explanation.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-6249-names\">\nNote the lack of names, too: the editor is given an initial, <em>R</em>, but the only character given an actual name is a dog. <a href=\"#fnref-6249-names\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

We fought, we lost, and now we’ve got to live with the consequences.</p>\n<p>Which won’t really start to take effect until the start of next year, of course, because we’ll be in the transition period until then. Until 2021 we’ll still be able to travel freely; there will be no added tariffs on goods; food standards will still be the high ones we’re used to.</p>\n<p>Ah yes, food standards. Just the other day I had a realisation — no, it was something that I already knew. More a dawning fear of how close a bad thing was. What brought it home was this headline in the <cite>Independent</cite>: “<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-chlorinated-chicken-us-trade-deal-boris-johnson-pompeo-trump-a9310081.html\">Brexit: US insists chlorinated chicken must be on menu in any UK trade agreement</a>.”</p>\n<p>Obviously no-one’s going to force anyone to buy or eat chicken, chlorine-washed or otherwise. But remember <em>why</em> chicken in the US is washed in chlorine, and why importing it into the EU is banned: it’s because the food standards are significantly lower than those in the EU. The chlorine washing is to kill off bacteria and make the meat fit for human consumption.</p>\n<p>So what that headline means is that a US trade deal could depend on the UK lowering its food standards. That’s what Brexit means: our government could choose to lower the standards of hygiene required in food production. Sit with that thought for a while.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of good things to think about on this bleak day. Both of those are also from America, and neither has anything to do with Brexit.

Not all of them. of course, but many. And that includes some of the Christmas carols. A full choir singing ‘Hark the Herald Angels Sing,’ or ‘Oh Come All Ye Faithful’? I’m there.</p>\n<p>The <em>best</em> Christmas songs, though, <em>do</em> belong to the — let’s say — secular side of things. I have a hierarchy of my personal favourites. Things move around a bit, and very occasionally new ones arrive; and you won’t be surprised to learn that ‘Fairytale of New York’ remains unassailable in the top spot.</p>\n<p>One of my other favourites is Greg Lake’s 1975 hit, ‘I Believe in Father Christmas.’ Now, if you haven’t listened to the words too closely — written, I’m surprised to discover, by Peter Sinfield, of whom I had barely heard before researching this — you might think it’s a simple celebration of Christmas, set to a jaunty tune, much like Slade’s ‘Merry Xmas Everybody,’ from a couple of years earlier (and every year since). It’s not, though. It’s much darker and more interesting than that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  They sold me a dream of Christmas<br>\n  They sold me a Silent Night<br>\n  They told me a fairy story<br>\n  Till I believed in the Israelite\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>And that closing couplet:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Hallelujah, Noel, be it Heaven or hell<br>\n  The Christmas we get we deserve\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lake and Sinfield have argued that it’s not anti-religious or atheistic. Well, you can have your interpretation, guys. I know what I think.</p>\n<p>I mainly wrote this because I’ve wanted to use the line I’ve stolen as a title for years. And I’ll leave you with the wishes the song provides:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I wish you a hopeful Christmas<br>\n  I wish you a brave New Year\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think we’re all going to need some hope and some bravery in 2020.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Indeed, it could be said to be true of <em>all</em> literature, maybe all art. Moore’s use is more frequent than most, though: The <cite>Watchmen</cite> characters based on those from old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Comics\">Charlton Comics</a>; <cite>Marvelman</cite>/<cite>Miracleman</cite> a revival of Mick Anglo’s creation; <cite>Promothea</cite> digging into mythology and fiction, as <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/10/promethea-by-alan-moore-jh-williams-iii-mick-gray-todd-klein-books-2018-27/\">I wrote very positively about last year</a>; and so on.</p>\n<p>In the <cite>League</cite> it’s at its most explicit.

Even the subtitle of this one is from Shakespeare.</p>\n<p>There is, as I say, nothing wrong with any of that. It’s like sampling in music: it doesn’t matter that you’re using part of an earlier creation; what matters is what you <em>do</em> with it.</p>\n<p>And what Moore and O’Neil do with everything here is pretty spectacular. I won’t go into any detail, but suffice it to say that pretty much all the threads from the earlier volumes are tied up, and everything is over at the end. <em>Everything</em>.

I remember being at school, at the start of a term, so it must have been January, and Watty saying, “I envy you: you haven’t heard <cite>London Calling</cite> yet.” That idea of how important the first listen is. I’ve said similar things myself over the years, about various things.</p>\n<p>But honestly, I couldn’t tell you anything about my first hearing. I had probably heard the title track — it was a single, after all — and I went and bought the album, most likely at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Menzies\">John Menzies</a> in Dumbarton (though maybe at Hall Audio, the nearby hi-fi shop, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_Group\">Woolies</a>, or Boots, who used to sell records in those days). I do know it cost £3.99, because the band took a reduction in their royalties so it — a double album — could be sold at the same price as a single album. Excellent value, for one of the greatest records ever made.</p>\n<p>Though I paid for it a couple more times over the years. Someone walked off with my copy during a party at my student flat in Edinburgh. I replaced it with a second-hand copy, probably from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Record-Shak/131108243603860\">Record Shak</a> (<em>sic</em>) on Clerk Street.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>One interesting thing about this book that I don’t recall noticing when I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2007/09/20/the-steep-approach-to-garbadale-by-iain-banks-books-2007-4/\">read it twelve years ago</a> is that the story itself <em>is</em> the titular approach. We don’t get to Garbadale House until about two-thirds of the way through, and then the rest of it is set there. With a few flashbacks and <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">-forwards</span> thrown in to both sections.</p>\n<p>Banksie always plays with form and structure, and this is no exception. Not just the aforementioned directional flashes, but use of different viewpoint characters and tenses. Mostly it’s from the viewpoint of Alban McGill, one of the many members of the Wopuld family. Some scenes are from that of a cousin of his. There are even a couple of instances of promiscuous PoV, or “head-hopping,” where we get the thoughts of another character within the same scene.</p>\n<p>Also some parts switch to present-tense, while most if it is past. There doesn’t seem to be any obvious function to those switches: it’s not like the tense reflects the timeline within the story. It seems arbitrary, almost random — though maybe I’m missing something there.</p>\n<p>None of this harms the story, it’s just worth noting. The strangest of these devices is that there are three or four sections in first-person, from the PoV of a minor character. All the rest is third-person. That gives the impression that this character is more significant than he is. The text in those sections is also rendered with spelling mistakes and grocer’s apostrophes, as if it was the direct transcript of what this relatively poorly-educated character has scribbled down.</p>\n<p>What’s the point of all that? I’m not sure. Just writerly games, maybe. I wonder if it suggests that Banks didn’t think the story itself was interesting enough to sustain the narrative, which might be a valid criticism. A well-off family with a secret at its heart has to decide whether to sell its business. The secret comes out, but it doesn’t make much difference. It would be significant to the characters affected, but we hardly see them after the reveal.</p>\n<p>Endearing characters, though, and even on a second read (I didn’t recall the secret), it keeps the pages turning.</p>\n<p>As I said twelve years ago, “In a book like this, the pleasure is in the journey more than the destination.”</p>\n</body></html>\n",

They would say: <strong>‘But it’s on Facebook – how can there be something that isn’t true?’</strong> They think there are gatekeepers but there aren’t.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Emphases mine.

We’ll get a hard Brexit starting in a month and a half (and taking years and years before it “gets done,” of course). We’ll see more privatisation in the NHS. We’ll see more austerity, I don’t doubt, despite the spending pledges that might have been in the Tory manifesto. And we’ll see moves to restrict what parliament and the courts can do to protect ordinary people.</p>\n<p>Our best hope is that Johnson is incompetent, and that’s not something we should have to rely on.</p>\n<p>What is wrong with this country? Why do people continue to vote against not just the interests of the most vulnerable in society, but against their <em>own</em> self interest?</p>\n<p>On Twitter a lot of people are blaming Corbyn, and I think they’re right. I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/12/10/fear-and-loathing-all-over-the-land/\">said just the other day</a> that I didn’t understand the dislike; but a thread by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/RussInCheshire\">@RussInCheshire</a> has helped to clarify my thinking. This regards not so much why people generally dislike him, but why he was ineffectual or worse as a leader. The key points:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  People will say “the media is biased”. Yes. But that’s the environment Labour leaders always operate in. Complaining about it is like trawler captains complaining the sea is wet. Yep. Learn to thrive in those conditions, or get off the boat.</p>\n<p>  People will say “they treated him worse than any previous leader”. They did. Cos he was shit at working the press, had a history of opinions that could be easily made to look awful, was inept on antisemitism, shifty on Brexit and cantankerous on TV.</p>\n<p>  People will say “no way is he racist”. Perhaps. But if people accused me of antisemitism, I’d be able to clearly defend myself, demonstrate my credentials, and put in place a strategy to stop accusations. He couldn’t. If he’s not antisemitic, he’s inept.</p>\n<p>  People will say “voters love him in person”. I’m sure. But we’ve been in the age of broadcasting for 80 years. What the hell use is being warm and cuddly to 600 people in a field, when you come over badly to 60 million people on TV?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The thread <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RussInCheshire/status/1205249028637806592\">starts here</a>, but it might be easier to read <a href=\"https://threader.app/thread/1205249028637806592\">here, as expanded</a> by the <a href=\"https://threader.app\">Threader App</a>.</p>\n<p>I still don’t understand — I never will — people who switch from Labour all the way to Conservative. They just vox-popped someone on the telly who used to vote Labour, but “couldn’t, in conscience,” vote for them with Corbyn as leader. Fair enough. But she voted Tory. Why go all the way over to the party that diametrically opposes the values she claims to support, when there are other progressive parties, that support some of those values. The party she voted for opposes those values.</p>\n<p>Baffling. Utterly baffling.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Or at least, I understand The Fear.</p>\n<p>I understand the fear of Brexit; of giving the Tories control, yet again, of the NHS, and of <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2011/01/05/republicans-good-at-theatre-dreadful-at-governing/\">the economy</a>; and of their plans for <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/tory-manifesto-conservative-boris-johnson-dictator-general-election-brexit-a9216861.html\">changing the constitution</a> in all the wrong ways, since I feel it myself.</p>\n<p>But despite my <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/11/10/ex-corbyn-fan/\">problems</a> with <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/11/11/deeds-not-words/\">Corbyn</a>, I don’t understand the loathing for him. It doesn’t seem to come from dislike of his policies. Some of the people who say they don’t like or don’t trust him seem to be Labour voters, who you’d expect to have similar beliefs. Even if those people have more centrist beliefs, you’d think they’d be close enough to the party’s current policies  not to be put off totally.</p>\n<p>It seems almost to be <em>personal</em>. Do some people dislike him as a person? Strikes me as odd, as he comes across as quite moderate and reasonable to me. To be sure, he can get snappy with interviewers at times, but it’s nothing compared to some people. And at least he doesn’t bluster; doesn’t lie; and always gives the impression that he knows what he’s talking about.</p>\n<p>Yet some people say they don’t trust him. Sometimes those same people say they <em>do</em> trust Johnson, even as they acknowledge he lies. It’s unfathomable.</p>\n<p>On tonight’s <cite>Channel 4 News</cite> they interviewed a guy in Johnson’s constituency who claimed to be a socialist, but who is going to vote for Johnson this time. They didn’t push him for an explanation.</p>\n<p>In the same constituency there was a business owner who had always voted Tory but is <em>not</em> going to this time, because of the way the party has been taken over by the far right. It takes a Tory businessman to recognise what a “socialist” can’t. We are through the looking glass and no mistake.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I’ll be voting Green. I hope everyone reading this will get out and vote on Thursday, for anyone who isn’t the Tories, and to stop Brexit.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I succumbed. As I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/11/14/watchmen-by-alan-moore-dave-gibbons-books-2019-21/\">suggested I might</a>.</p>\n<p>It felt a little grubby, going to the NowTV site and setting up an account. As you know, Sky TV and I have a history. Or maybe an anti-history, insofar as I am anti everything that their former owner stands for. But the key word is “former.” With Comcast now owning it, I can feel a little better about giving them my time and possibly some money.</p>\n<p>Still, though: grubby.</p>\n<p>But what’s worse, as a viewing experience, is that their app is the worst video-playback app I’ve ever used. It’s fine at all the basics; it even has a ten-second jump back and forward feature, which is good. But! It completely fails at subtitles.</p>\n<p>Now,  in this era — this platinum age of television — subtitles are often an essential part of viewing. And that isn’t true just due to my age, because my kids, who are young adults, are at least as likely as us olds to want them on. Mumblecore actors are to blame. Or maybe bad sound on our TV. Or a combination. Doesn’t matter. We watch with subtitles on <em>a lot</em> of the time, and I wanted them on for <cite>Watchmen</cite>.</p>\n<p>But NowTV — in its Mac app, at least — just can’t handle them properly. They either freeze, so you get the same sentence stuck on the screen for five minutes; or they just get out of sync. Sometimes they rush through minutes of text at a time, as if trying to catch up. In the end I turned them off.</p>\n<p>But I watched one episode on my iPad, and the subtitles were fine there. So I guess it is the actual Mac app. The Mac plugged into the telly is an old one. A <em>nine-year-old</em> MacBook Pro, in fact. I’m impressed that it’s still working, though I did <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2016/04/27/i-upgraded-my-macbook/\">upgrade it at one point</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that can’t be the reason it’s bad, because I’ve also tried it on my 2017 MBP, with exactly the same results.</p>\n<p>But what about the programme?</p>\n<p>It’s a sequel to the comic, set around thirty years later. I found the first episode kind of annoying, though I’m not quite sure why. Too much of it set in the past, maybe? But as we’ve got to know the characters and things have moved along, it’s definitely interesting. I’ve watched the first five episodes so far. Up to which point it’s kind of a cop show with an unusual background. Cops go masked so that criminals can’t identify them. Criminals go masked too, of course, specifically in Rorscach-style black and white masks.</p>\n<p>And there’s a mysterious old guy who puts on plays reenacting the origin of <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Osterman\">Doctor Manhattan</a>. You’ll have guesses about who he is, if you know the source material. Well, one guess.</p>\n<p>I like the way they’ve built on the comic, and are weaving the backstory in. Though I think it must be extremely confusing for anyone who hasn’t read the novel, or at least seen the movie.</p>\n<p>My main question (apart from the obvious ones, like what’s going on with Veidt?) is: why is <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Laurie_Juspeczyk\">Laurie</a> using her father’s surname? It doesn’t make sense to me that she’d call herself Blake, instead of Juspeczyck.</p>\n<p>Oh, and whatever happened to <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Dan_Dreiberg\">Dan Dreiberg</a>? I want to see some Nite owl action. Something that looked a lot like the <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Owlship\">Owlship</a> appeared in the first episode, so maybe he’ll turn up. As, I imagine, will Doctor Manhattan.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Plenty of non-Jewish people are put off by it too.</p>\n<p>There are two things I don’t understand.</p>\n<p>If there are antisemites in Labour (which, again, does seem to be the case): why and how? Who are these people that have joined a party of the left, a party that has always been anti-nazi, anti-racist, pro equality and human rights — who join it, and yet stand in direct opposition to its core values? It’s like a climate-change denier joining the Green Party.</p>\n<p>Further, why now? Why has this blown up in the last couple of years? These invasive members presumably haven’t <em>just</em> joined the party. It’s hard to imagine that they joined because of Corbyn being the leader.</p>\n<p>Unless that’s exactly what it is. Maybe Corbyn’s seeming weakness on responding to the problem. and/or a willful misunderstanding of his stance on Palestine and the government of Israel, has attracted such people to the party. In which case — in any case — the obvious thing to do is to find them and eject them; just as they can easily eject members who suggest voting for another party.</p>\n<p>I see that <cite>The Guardian</cite> has published an “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/antisemitism-labour-everything-you-need-to-know\">everything you need to know</a>” guide on the matter.

The fifth volume (or second volume of the second series) was out, but the sixth and final wasn’t.<sup id=\"fnref-5943-whitegold\"><a href=\"#fn-5943-whitegold\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> I waited on tenterhooks.<sup id=\"fnref-5943-tenter\"><a href=\"#fn-5943-tenter\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup> Eventually the hardback came out, but it was much too expensive for a poor student like me. Luckily, not for another poor student on my corridor, who lent it to me.</p>\n<p>I learnt my lesson, back then. More or less: I was reading <cite>Harry Potter</cite> while it was still being written. But this is one of the main reasons why I never started <cite>A Game of Thrones</cite>, for example.</p>\n<p>But here we are. Two-thirds of the way in to a compelling, thrilling story… actually that’s not quite right, what with <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/05/20/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-the-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-books-2018-12/\">the first volume</a> being prequel. More like halfway through a very long story, and all I can say is… not very much without going into massive spoilers.</p>\n<p>I like that Lyra is using Silvertongue as her surname: a name she was given, that she <em>earned</em>. There are aspects of the world, of Lyra’s relationship to it, that are surprising, given what she went through in <cite>His Dark Materials</cite>. But then, it <em>is</em> eight years later, and she has grown up a lot.</p>\n<p>Politics and events in the world of the Magisterium sometimes parallel those in our world.</p>\n<p>It’s a lot darker and more adult-themed than the original trilogy. I don’t know if the whole will end up being as legendary or as moving as the original, of course, but at this point, balanced on the fulcrum of change, I like it almost as much.</p>\n<p>I lied at the the start: you <em>should</em> read this book. But be prepared for the fact that we might have to wait two years for the conclusion.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5943-pinch\">\nAt a pinch, if the author hasn’t finished writing it. <a href=\"#fnref-5943-pinch\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5943-whitegold\">\n<cite>White Gold Wielder</cite> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant#The_Second_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant\">was released in 1983, I see</a>.

Corbyn was, predictably, calmer, more sensible, and less blustering. He needed to answer the “What way would you campaign in a second referendum” question that Johnson kept going back to, but otherwise he handled it pretty well.</p>\n<p>Johnson, of course, is the epitome of bluster, barely gave a straight answer to anything, and went over his allotted time on every question, as well as his opening and closing statements.</p>\n<p>I criticise him for that since he was violating the agreed-upon format. But the time-limited questions may have been the worst part of the event. The purpose is to limit bloviation, I suppose, but it seemed like often the chair was cutting the speaker off while they were still trying to make a point. I saw a tweet while it was going on, to the effect that part of the problem in politics is that everything is reduced to soundbites, with no opportunity to go into details. I’m inclined to agree.</p>\n<p>However, much more interesting, and a bettter format, was the interviews, an hour later, with the leaders of the some of the other parties: Jo Swinson, Nicola Sturgeon, Siân Berry of the Greens, and, unfortunately, Nigel Farage.</p>\n<p>One interviewer, one interviewee at a time, and it was all much more sensible. That is, in part, because of the people involved, of course. The three women were all good, especially Wee Nicola, as we like to call her. But perhaps it wouldn’t have worked so well if Johnson had been in the interviewee’s chair. He’d have been havering and talking over the interviewer, no doubt. Though to be fair, Farage managed not to do that, so who knows.</p>\n<p>But overall, I think that the debate format is not the best way to present your ideas.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Maybe it’s because he’s the only one that gets much screen time where he talks.</p>\n<p>On that note, two points about Mrs Coulter’s daemon, one which struck me on my recent reread, and the other just tonight. We never learn its name. Nearly every other daemon that gets a mention, gets a name. And it never speaks.

The Murdochs no longer own Sky TV, so I can let myself watch it.</p>\n<p>But then we have the other ethical question, about <cite>Watchmen</cite> in particular.

Maybe it’s just be that he expects to get a majority, and thereby make it easier to get the WAB through in a new parliament. But I can’t help thinking that he’s up to something.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Almost exactly a year ago I started reading a novel, then put it on hold. This year I’ve done the same, for different reasons.</p>\n<p>I started <cite>The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet</cite> by Becky Chambers in October of last year. I quickly put it aside as November approached. I realised that it — or at least its start — was much too similar to the <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/31/5196/\">novel that I planned to start for NaNoWriMo</a>.</p>\n<p>I haven’t got back to it yet.</p>\n<p>This year it was the new Philip Pullman, <cite>The Book of Dust vol 2: The Secret Commonwealth</cite></p>\n<p>Now, you’ll recall that I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/05/20/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-the-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-books-2018-12/\">said I might do this</a> after I read the first of the new trilogy. Other things got in the way of that, though.</p>\n<p>So I read a chapter or two of the new one, and realised I needed to refresh my memories. There’s a whole thing that we learn about at once that I don’t remember. Or at least don’t remember how it happened.</p>\n<p>There’s also a TV series coming. I was aware it was in development, but not of how soon it was going to be. Turns out it’ll be on in a week or two.</p>\n<p>So now I’m worried that  watching it is going to be a bit like the recent <cite>Good Omens</cite> series was for me; really well done, I appreciated it… but I had <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/05/21/good-omens-by-terry-pratchett-and-neil-gaiman-books-2019-6/\">re-read the book</a> too soon before watching it, meaning it was all just a bit too recent in my memory for maximum enjoyment. But we’ll cross that ice bridge to another world when we come it it. The trailers look great, anyway.</p>\n<p>The difference with this year’s pause will be that, while I will get back to the Chambers eventually, I’m obviously not in any hurry to do so. Whereas I fully expect to restart <cite>The Secret Commonwealth</cite> as soon as I’ve recovered from the ending of <cite>The Amber Spyglass</cite>. Which I’ll probably be starting quite soon.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I don’t really care for dystopias, <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2015/09/08/station-eleven-by-emily-st-john-mandel-books-2015-8/\">as I’ve said before</a>. Interesting that the book I linked to there had just won the Clarke, and the one we’re discussing was the inaugural winner of that award.</p>\n<p>For the first few chapters I was distracted by wondering how this situation, this state, could have come to be. Strangely what I found difficult to cope with was not the restrictions, the rolling back of rights — they are horrific, but I could and can easily imagine an America (or, hell, maybe even a Britain) that could enact those laws.</p>\n<p>No, what I found hardest to believe in was the dress codes. The way not just the Handmaids, but the marthas (domestic servants), econowives (lower-class, probably infertile women, assigned to lower-class men) and even Wives (the wives of the ruling-class men) all dress in the standard costume of their class.</p>\n<p>Somehow I feel — or at least felt — that it would be harder to get everyone to dress the same way than to obey laws that restrict more important freedoms.</p>\n<p>As the chapters went on, those concerns evaporated. The telling of the backstory through Offred’s reminiscences outlines a convincing route from 80s America to Gilead. Though a lot more could be told: it is only an outline. Still, it’s enough.</p>\n<p>These days, with actual nazis poisoning our political discourse, and attempts to roll back reproductive rights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/06/french-protests-against-ivf-treatment-for-gay-and-single-women\">even in France</a>, it sometimes feels — as Atwood no doubt intended — that Gilead is not so much a fable as a warning.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Don’t read on if you haven’t seen it and care about being spoiled.</p>\n<p>Or maybe “buddy pic,” rather than “love story;” but the relationship between the two leads will be analysed for its homoerotic content, no doubt.</p>\n<p>How it certainly <em>has</em> been described is “a love letter to Hollywood,” and that’s fair enough. What it also is, is a counter-factual, or alternative history. But don’t worry, I’m not going to claim this one for SF.<sup id=\"fnref-5837-sf\"><a href=\"#fn-5837-sf\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The main characters – fading cowboy actor Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his regular stunt double Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt – are invented. But most of the other named characters, and many who are mentioned or appear as extras, are real people. The most significant of these is Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie. And it’s her story that makes this film most interesting, and maybe problematic.</p>\n<p>Because of course she died tragically, murdered by members of Charles Manson’s “Family” cult. And in this version — she doesn’t.</p>\n<p>If you know the history — which of course, many younger people won’t, which makes for different ways of experiencing the film — then you spend half the time expecting the massacre. There are captioned dates, and even though most of us wouldn’t know the date of the murders, there can’t really be any other reason for showing them. And then when it comes, something else happens.</p>\n<p>The violence in that scene is gruesome, over the top, ludicrous — almost hallucinogenic, making me wonder if the tripping Booth<sup id=\"fnref-5837-transgressor\"><a href=\"#fn-5837-transgressor\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> is meant to have hallucinated some or all of it. But there’s no need for there to be so much of it, or for the majority of it to be directed at women. The “Family” did consist largely of women, I guess, but I can’t help but feeling that Tarantino is revelling in it a little too much.</p>\n<p>And on top of all that, as my family agreed after seeing it: there’s no real <em>need</em> for the whole Sharon Tate thread of the story. It would have made a fine tale if were just about the two actors against the backdrop of late-60s Hollywood. I wonder what the point of it was. Did Tarantino feel he could in some way “save” Sharon Tate?</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5837-sf\">\nAlthough that might be an interesting exercise. There isn’t really enough <em>after</em> the big change to make it worthwhile, though. <a href=\"#fnref-5837-sf\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5837-transgressor\">\nThere’s probably no significance to his having the same surname as the killer in David Lynch’s <cite>Blue Velvet</cite>.

I think I saw a tweet, or something, thought it looked interesting, and instantly bought it because it was only a few quid on Kindle. It’s a huge book which tries — successfully, in my mind — to explain how the bulk of David Lynch’s creative works can be considered part of a single story, which Horton refers to as <cite>The Dream</cite>.</p>\n<p>Now obviously <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, <cite>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</cite>, and <cite>Twin Peaks: The Return</cite> are all part of the same story. As are the various spinoff books: Jennifer Lynch’s <cite>The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer</cite>, and Scott Frost’s <cite>The Autobiography of FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes</cite>, from back around the time of the original broadcast; and Mark Frost’s more recent <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/03/the-secret-of-twin-peaks-by-mark-frost-books-2017-1/\">The Secret History of Twin Peaks</a></cite> and <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/02/27/twin-peaks-the-final-dossier-by-mark-frost-books-2018-4/\">Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier</a></cite>, which I’ve written about here.</p>\n<p>But Horton argues that the whole story gets kicked off in <cite>Eraserhead</cite>, and that <cite>Blue Velvet</cite>, <cite>Lost Highway</cite>, <cite>Mulholland Dr</cite> and <cite>Inland Empire</cite> are side stories related to the main branch. The overall story being about an eternal being, The Dreamer, who dreams reality into existence, and also creates another being, known as Jowday, or Judy, who becomes his adversary. BOB, the possessing spirit of the original <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, is a creation of this entity, and the Black and White Lodges are the vanguards in the battle between the two beings.</p>\n<p>Sure, on one level it’s just good vs evil, heaven &amp; hell — “just,” I say, as if that wasn’t enough. But the sheer scope of it is astonishing. The eighteen hours of <cite>The Return</cite> has been hailed as an incredible masterpiece of visual storytelling. But when you include all that I’ve listed above, and three of Lynch’s paintings to boot — it must be one of the greatest — in terms of size, at least — creative works by a single visionary. True, it’s far from being by a single <em>creator</em>, but the vision behind it is solely or primarily Lynch’s, or that of Lynch and Mark Frost.</p>\n<p>And even if the connections to the other films are just in Horton’s head (and, to be fair, those of others whose work he acknowledges): the obviously-connected stuff is still amazing, and the current work, Horton’s book that I’m writing about, is something a of a creative triumph itself.</p>\n<p>One that is slightly marred by its self-published nature and obvious lack of an editor — there are a <em>lot</em> of typos — but a hugely impressive one nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Though obviously it’s only for the very serious <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> fan.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I had vaguely seen references to “ratios,” and was aware it was something to do with engagement on Twitter and elsewhere. But I hadn’t understood what exactly people meant by it. Then last night I saw a tweet in which someone said, “I accept I’ve been ratiod.” (Should the verb form rather be “ratioed”? Hard to say. Neither looks quite right.)</p>\n<p>A search for understanding led me to <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-ratio\">this article on  Know Your Meme</a>.  It tells us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The Ratio refers to an unofficial Twitter law which states that if the amount of replies to a tweet greatly outnumbers the amount of retweets and likes, then the tweet is bad\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>and goes into some detail about the origin of the term.</p>\n<p>It makes me sad to read that. Imagine an interaction system where, if people reply to something you say, that’s bad. Well, it seems we don’t have to imagine it: we can see it right here on the “social” web.</p>\n<p>I like to get replies on Twitter or elsewhere. A reply means, to me, that someone has read what I’ve written, thought about it, and found it worth responding to. I’m aware that I speak from a position of some privilege, in that I’m not in a group that is likely to experience the mass abuse that many do. But something has broken down in our systems of interaction if getting replies mean what you said “is bad.”</p>\n<p>I’m far from the first to have made that observation, of course.</p>\n<p>But consider <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a>, the still-young social network based on blogs that I’ve <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/02/02/success-for-micro-blog/\">written abut before</a>. Micro.blog has replies, but it doesn’t even have the concept of likes or retweets/reblogs. If you read a post and want to say something about it — even just that you like it — you have to reply.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Back when the internet was young — or at least the commercial, available-at-home internet — I sent an email with the  subject line, “Bicycle on the Superhighway”. It was about me having a publicly-accessible email address for the first time since uni (as opposed to one that was only usable within the company where I worked at the time).</p>\n<p>This was back when people — inspired, if I recall correctly, by Al Gore — were calling the net the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_superhighway\">Information Superhighway</a>.”</p>\n<p>This post is not about all that, though; this is about literal cycling on a literal superhighway: specifically London’s “<a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/routes-and-maps/cycle-superhighways\">Cycle Superhighways</a>.”</p>\n<p>Since the building where I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/05/08/new-job-obtained/\">now work</a> has showers, I decided it was time to get back on the bike. And since it’s in Westminster, it turns out there’s a really easy route, that uses CS6 and CS3: down Farringdon Road and west along Embankment, by the river.</p>\n<p>These are fantastic cycling facilities, especially the Embankment one. Properly separated from the motor traffic, plenty of room to move and overtake, great sequencing of traffic lights so you hardly have to stop. It’s hard to fault it. Especially compared to nearly every other pathetic painted cycle lane in the city.</p>\n<p>It gets a bit hairy where it all ends, in Parliament Square: the traffic there is unfeasibly heavy. Who drives near parliament?</p>\n<p>If there’s a downside to it all, it’s this: I suspect that the motorised traffic is busier and faster, exactly because it’s not tempered by having bikes in the mix. I can’t be sure — I’ve never used Embankment before, and it’s years since I used to cycle regularly on Farringdon Road — but it feels to me that there’s a crazy amount of traffic and that it’s going faster than ever.</p>\n<p>The latter can’t really be true — there are still speed limits, and they either won’t have changed or might have dropped to 20 mph in sections. But I still get this sense that, freed from interacting with the fragile two-wheeled minority, the armoured legions behave more like they’re on a motorway.</p>\n<p>Whether that’s the case or not, the number of people cycling — especially in the recent bright spring weather — is huge. The only time I’ve seen more cyclists together was when I did the London to Brighton ride many years ago.</p>\n<p>And also in the mix now are electric scooters and electric skateboards, which makes it all the more interesting. There’s even the odd cycle rickshaw.</p>\n<p>It’ll be interesting to see how the volume changes with the seasons, but you can’t beat it for a way to commute: it’s faster than the tube, it saves you money, and you get some exercise. I recommend it for anyone who’s able.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

In fact I started it sometime last year. But reading the Clash book did make me want to get back to this, and refresh my memories of the early days of punk.</p>\n<p>Reading a history of a time you lived through is interesting. Not that I was involved in the events, but I was distantly aware of at least some of them. In the years the book covers I was between 12 and 15. Or maybe just 14, as it only gets as far as early 79. It’s a short period of time, looking back, and they — the Pistols, and most of the other bands too — were incredibly young. They were just 20 and 21 when they signed their first deal. And their second. And their third.</p>\n<p>At times Savage appears to think that punk was over when the pistols split, if not before. And generally to have quite negative thoughts about it as it developed Though he undercuts that contempt later, in the appendices and in the notes scattered through the huge discography at the end. He acknowledges the influence of punk, though considers it just to be one of a range of genres or forms that influences popular music. Which is fair enough, though there are still, even today, bands that consider themselves to be punk. Whether that’s a good thing or not, I don’t know.</p>\n<p>Something that came out of it that surprised me — though doesn’t, now that I know the facts — is that you can no longer get the film of <cite>The Great Rock ‘n’ Roll Swindle</cite> in any form (though you can still get the soundtrack album). That’s because it was McLaren’s project, it sets him up as hero, and makes Lydon the almost-unseen villain. Lydon hated McLaren by the end, and eventually won control of the Sex Pistols name and assets in a series of court cases. Presumably he controls whether it will ever be released.</p>\n<p>I find this mildly annoying, because I saw it couple of times when I was a student, and enjoyed it, and wouldn’t mind seeing it again. Second-hand DVD copies are available, but they’re mostly pricey and/or being shipped from the States.</p>\n<p>I suppose the more recent, documentary film, <cite>The Filth and the Fury</cite>, might be worth seeing. I see that, like <cite>The Swindle</cite>, it is directed by Julien Temple. Clearly Lydon didn’t mind <em>his</em> work on McLaren’s film.</p>\n<p>What doesn’t come through very much is any sense of Jon Savage himself. What was he doing, and how did he get involved in all this? I gather he wrote a fanzine, <cite>London’s Outrage</cite>, and he became a journalist writing for <cite>Sounds</cite>, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Savage\">his Wikipedia entry</a>. While he has done extensive research, and interviewed many of the participants, some of the story clearly comes from his being there at the time.</p>\n<p>But the only real sense of that we get is that, towards the last third or so of the book, a series of dated, italicised entries appear. They clearly are — or are meant to be — diary entries from the time. Or notes for articles he wrote at the time, perhaps, giving us something of a first-person view of some to the gigs and so on. I would have liked to see more made of these, or more generally about his experience and from his point of view. A book about punk ought to be a bit more gonzo, I think.</p>\n<p>But on the whole it’s a great read.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>You could spend a lot of time wondering what makes Theresa May tick.</p>\n<p>She says she supported remain and voted to stay in the European Union. So her increasing fervour for Brexit has been one of the most confusing factors in British politics over the last two and a half years.</p>\n<p>Taking over the Tory leadership after David Cameron resigned was always going to be a poisoned chalice. No-one would have had a good time in that position, except maybe a genuine hard quitter like Jacob Rees-Mogg. That’s probably why Gove and Johnson pulled out.</p>\n<p>If she truly believed that staying in was best, though, she would not have rushed into triggering Article 50 (nor would she have gone to court to fight for her wish to do so by diktat; luckily National Hero Gina Miller had the nation’s back on that one).</p>\n<p>If she had used more care, collaboration, and consideration, she might have had an easier time when Article 50 finally was triggered and the negotiations started. In fact if she had been more thoughtful in the first place she might even have said something like, “The vote was close; the country is clearly divided. We will discuss the possible ways forward in parliament and with the rest of the EU, and come back to you, the people, for confirmation when we better understand what Brexit means.” <sup id=\"fnref-5415-brexitmeans\"><a href=\"#fn-5415-brexitmeans\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>But no: “Brexit means Brexit”: she knew up front what it meant, and never deviated. Even if the majority of the country had no idea what it would mean.</p>\n<p>She then proceeded as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ignore any idea of cross-party talks and so involving parliament (the UK’s sovereign body) in the negotiations;</li>\n<li>trigger Article 50 as soon as she could;</li>\n<li>negotiate with the EU27 almost in secret;</li>\n<li>have inflexible “red lines” to appease the hard quitters, leaving herself no room for compromise in the negotiations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s a truism, even a cliche, to say that she puts the Tory party before the country. But the only way I can explain such a dramatic change of heart is that her love for the Tory party overruled her knowledge that being in the EU was, is, and will be the best situation for the UK. And that she somehow convinced herself that she could heal her fatally-divided party.</p>\n<p>In fact, the very thing that Cameron was trying to do by calling he referendum in the first place.</p>\n<p>“Tory eurosceptics” used to be a common enough phrase, but it denoted a tiny fringe of the party: a few loons like John Redwood. But in trying to appease them, two Tory leaders and prime ministers have turned them mainstream and brought us to where we are today, on the brink of leaving the EU without any kind of agreement for our future relationship.</p>\n<p>And their party is as divided as ever.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5415-brexitmeans\">\nThat’s fanciful, of course.

The subtitle is “Reagan, Thatcher, and the Last Stand of A Band That Mattered,”<sup id=\"fnref-5409-oxford\"><a href=\"#fn-5409-oxford\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> which captures well its structure. It interleaves the politics of what was happening on both sides of the Atlantic — the miners’ strike, Reagan’s nuclear brinksmanship, the Iran/Contra scandal — with what was happening with the most political of the original punk bands.</p>\n<p>It’s interesting to read a history of a time you lived through and were, however tangentially, involved in. Andersen and Heibutzki more than do justice to their material. The research they must have done is impressive. I know personally that Andersen came to the UK on a research trip, but aside from that they have interviewed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Howard\">three</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Sheppard\">non-original</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_White\">members</a> of The Clash, <a href=\"https://kosmovinyl.com/\">Kosmo Vinyl</a>, and various other people who were involved or just had something useful to say.</p>\n<p>And they must have spent a lot of time listening to concert tapes and studying set lists — which doesn’t sound like a chore to me, it’s fair to say.</p>\n<p>I learned two major things: first, I’d forgotten how good <cite>Cut the Crap</cite> is. I haven’t listened to it in ages, and when I went to do so on Apple Music, I found it isn’t there. Nor is it on Spotify. I have it on vinyl, but I don’t currently have access to a record player.</p>\n<p>Luckily Amazon and CDs both still exist, so I put some more money the way of… <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Rhodes\">Bernie Rhodes</a>, as it turns out.</p>\n<p>That’s the other big thing I found out: how — <em>difficult</em>, let’s say — Rhodes was. Not least since he signed the band — well, Joe and Paul: the others were effectively employees — into a contract that gave him, Rhodes, control over the album, as well as the name “The Clash.”</p>\n<p>But worse was the way he treated the new members while they were with the band. Constantly haranguing them, telling them they weren’t up to scratch, shouting at them… it’s a wonder they stayed. It sounds like an abusive environment.</p>\n<p>Joe could and should have stopped it, but it seems like he was still to some extent in Rhodes’s thrall — Bernie did bring the band together, after all — and possible suffering from depression. Certainly he was drinking heavily, and during that time his dad died and his mum got ill, and he became a father himself. It was a difficult time for him.</p>\n<p>I have more to say about the album, but I think that’s for a separate post. For now, this is a great rock book about a little-discussed time in the history of my favourite band.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5409-oxford\">\nGood to see the proper use of the Oxford comma there. <a href=\"#fnref-5409-oxford\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

Not least for the closing quote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “It’s not that Italian coffee has always been bad,” Campeotto said. “They have been geniuses. The god of coffee is the Italian espresso. The problem is, they have been stuck there. They stopped.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If they had already achieved the “god of coffee” (which I happen to agree with), then why would they do anything <em>other</em> than stop? If you’ve already achieved perfection you have no need to improve. Just make sure you maintain that level.</p>\n<p>I spent twelve months of 1989-90 in Turin. A cappuccino was 1200 lire, or about 60p (around 45-50 US cents, probably). And it was <em>delicious</em>. The best coffee I had, or have, ever tasted.</p>\n<p>The growth of Starbucks and the other chains came after that, and I’ve been looking for coffee as good ever since. I’ve never found it. The closest I ever found in London was Costa in its early days. It has slipped down to the level of Starbucks and Caffè Nero, though.</p>\n<p>Which is not to say that any of those are truly <em>bad</em>: not, at least, compared to what was available before they came on the scene.</p>\n<p>But nothing matches my memory of Torinese cappuccino.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Right, let’s get 2019 off to a start by talking about my favourite TV programme. I haven’t said anything about the recent season of <cite>Doctor Who</cite> here since my <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/07/5050/\">appreciative post</a> at the end of the first episode. Not for any reason other than not getting round to it.</p>\n<p>I absolutely love this iteration of the series. Jodie Whittaker is fantastic as The Doctor, and the supporting cast is brilliant as well. I like the crowded Tardis feel. It does have the limitation that some of the characters don’t get as much time or as many lines as others. That’s been notably true of Yaz — except in the “Demons of the Punjab” episode, of course.</p>\n<p>But there’s plenty of time for her to be developed further, assuming they’re all sticking around. And the focus being more on Ryan and Graham was entirely correct, since if there was an overarching theme to the season, it was grief.</p>\n<p>It’s not perfect. There have been several occasions when I’ve thought that the writing team don’t really understand what a galaxy is, or the scale of it. Lines like “half the people in the galaxy are unemployed,” or “they’ve crossed four galaxies to get here,” just don’t really make a lot of sense. And there have been several episodes where things maybe weren’t as tidily resolved as we’re used to.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s New Year special episode, “Resolution,” was a classic example of the kind of story where the ideas are good, but the whole thing could have been improved if they’d taken the time to come up with slightly better ways to make things happen. Some way of defeating the enemy that didn’t involve the microwave oven, for example. And the whole vacuum/supernova bit at the end was kind of farcical.</p>\n<p>But no matter. This season was all about the character dynamics, and those were great. It’s a strong start for Chris Chibnall as showrunner, and an incredibly strong start for Jodie Whittaker.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Which may be only three or four times. A friend got into Michener when we were teenagers. None of his books much interested me, until I looked at this.</p>\n<p>It’s a tale of hippies and others in 1969. Six young people from various countries meet each other in Torremolinos, and drift around the Iberian Peninsula and parts of Africa. The narrator, seemingly detached third-person at first, turns out to be an older man who knows some of the young people, and arranges business trips so that he can hang out with them from time to time.</p>\n<p>It’s about what was going on in the world — Vietnam, the Arab/Israeli conflict, drugs, music — and about the characters. They aren’t that well developed — indeed, he largely abandons character development after the first six chapters where he introduces each one — but those introductions are enough to see us through.</p>\n<p>Actually, thinking about it now, I wish he had written more about some of them. A sequel would have been in order.</p>\n<p>It’s partly, I suspect, Michener’s own struggle to come to terms with the way society is changing — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Michener\">he was born in 1907</a>, so he’d have been 62 at the time this is set. It was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drifters_(novel)\">published in 71</a>, so maybe a tad older when he wrote it. The narrator, George Fairbanks, is younger than that, I think — probably in his fifties, maybe even forties, but people seemed to become old at a younger age back then.</p>\n<p>Well worth a read.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

He didn’t come over just to interview me, I should stress. It was a research trip, and he visited various places and interviewed lots of people, some of my friends included.</p>\n<p>We’ve exchanged emails a couple of times since then, when he had followup questions, so I kind of expected to hear when the book came out. Coincidentally I was recently thinking about emailing him, to talk about something on the <a href=\"https://joestrummerfoundation.org/joe-strummer-001-archive-release/\"><cite>Joe Strummer 001</cite></a> collection of obscurities that came out a month or two back. Had I done so, I would of course have said, “So when’s the book coming out?”</p>\n<p>But here it is. I am extensively quoted (well, quoted a couple of times) in the section on the <a href=\"https://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_clashs_forgotten_years_1984_1986\">busking tour’s</a> visit to Edinburgh, which was mainly what he wanted me to talk about.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/we-are-the-clash/\">Here’s the publisher’s page</a> on it. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36436604-we-are-the-clash\">Here’s its GoodReads page</a>, and its <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clash-Reagan-Thatcher-Stand-Mattered/dp/1617752932\">Amazon UK</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clash-Reagan-Thatcher-Stand-Mattered/dp/1617752932\">US</a> links.

Sadly, after <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/11/30/a-five-and-four-zeroes/\">last year’s success</a>, this year <a href=\"https://nanowrimo.org/participants/devilgate/novels/delta-blues-beat-poet-of-the-spaceways/stats\">I failed</a>.</p>\n<p>As you’ll have seen if you clicked through to look at my stats, I averaged 595 words per day, for a total of 17,800. It’s not nothing, and it’s still a decent start on the new novel, but it’s nothing like last year.</p>\n<p>Why did I fail? A better question is, why was I successful last year? This year’s result is comparable to other years when I’ve tried it. Last year’s success looks like the aberration.</p>\n<p>The big difference between last year and any other was my commute. I’ve tended always to have a commute of about an hour — except when I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/02/recent-events-2/\">worked at the bank in the City</a>, when it was shorter. Last year I was working in Croydon, which took me an hour and a half or more to get to. The one good point was that, picking up the Overground from Dalston Junction, I nearly always got a seat within a few stops. And on the way back had one from the start (coming from West Croydon, which is the start of the line).</p>\n<p>So I was able to get forty or fifty minutes of concentrated writing time in each direction. Add to that the fact that the office I was in was really horrible, so I didn’t want to spend my lunch hours in it. I mostly went out and wrote in cafes or at <a href=\"https://www.boxpark.co.uk/croydon/\">Boxpark Croydon</a>. The one thing I miss about that job is the the places to eat, especially a little pizza place in Boxpark.</p>\n<p>Whereas now, working at Imperial, I’m back to a one-hour commute, with much less guarantee of a seat. And I really like both job and office, so I’m quite happy to go back there after I’ve got my lunch.</p>\n<p>One other point is that last year I had worked out how I was going to end the novel I had been working on for years, so I was running downhill towards that end. This year, starting a brand-new one — even though I’ve got a plan, it feels much more uphill.</p>\n<p>Still, we press on, writers against procrastination, borne forward ceaselessly into the future.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It is, in case you don’t know, a film from 1980 about and featuring The Clash. It’s kind of a fictionalised documentary, in that the titular character, Ray Gange, is both someone who was a sometime roadie for/hanger-on of The Clash, and playing the part of “Ray Gange.”<sup id=\"fnref-5250-Gange\"><a href=\"#fn-5250-Gange\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The worst part of it is, as I recalled, his “acting.” Well, that’s not quite true. Viewing it <em>as a film</em>, that’s the case. But viewing it as a document of the end of the seventies, the worst part of it is the casual racism. And indeed the organised racism of the National Front rally shown at the start.</p>\n<p>Also bad are the violence from police and bouncers, and the general horribleness of Britain in the seventies. Nothing looks clean, everything looks run-down or broken. It looks, in fact, far worse than I remember it being.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry, by the way, if you don’t remember what it was like, are too young to have experienced it, and/or don’t want to watch the film. It’ll be like that again in a couple of years if things go as we fear.</p>\n<p>The best parts are, of course, the scenes of The Clash live and in the studio. And we won’t get them back after Brexit.</p>\n<p>Also, in looking up the IMDB article, I discover that a) Ray Gange has actually been in a couple of other movies, and b) far more importantly, there is a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081441/\">2016 movie called <cite>London Town</cite></a>, which is a drama about those times.

I’m done with Jeremy Corbyn. <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/interview-with-labour-leader-corbyn-we-can-t-stop-brexit-a-1237594.html\">This interview in <cite>Der Spiegel</cite></a>, in which he says “Brexit can’t be stopped,” is the clincher.</p>\n<p>As always, literally <em>everything else he says</em> is on the good side of politics — the side I tend to agree with, to be less judgmental. But he refuses to resist — even, really, to engage with<sup id=\"fnref-5198-march\"><a href=\"#fn-5198-march\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> — the thing that is the most important political issue and biggest political mistake of our lifetime (setting aside for the moment climate change, which is not just a political issue, and is global in scope, not just European). Look at this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Not just Labour, but the whole country is extremely divided at the moment — not least because of Brexit. If you could stop Brexit, would you?</p>\n<p>  <strong>Corbyn:</strong> We can’t stop it. The referendum took place. Article 50 has been triggered. What we can do is recognize the reasons why people voted Leave.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is that “will of the people” nonsense, the idea that it would be undemocratic to ask again. The will of the people can change, and almost certainly has. And you don’t agree to a deal with going back and checking that it’s still OK. Having a confirmatory referendum would be considerably <em>more</em> democratic than not having one.<sup id=\"fnref-5198-cut\"><a href=\"#fn-5198-cut\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> And we <em>can</em> stop it. Parliament, which is, and always was, sovereign, could revoke Article 50.</p>\n<p>Back to the interview:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I’ve been critical of the competitions policy in Europe and the move towards free market, and obviously critical in the past of their treatment of Greece, although that was mostly the eurozone that did that. My idea is of a social Europe with inclusive societies that work for everyone and not just for a few.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>You don’t build a “social Europe with inclusive societies that work for everyone and not just for a few” by leaving the EU! You build it by staying in, and working to build that society! God, it’s infuriating.</p>\n<p>I voted for him as leader, I respect and believe in most of his policies, but he needs to go. Labour won three general elections under Tony Blair, and was able to do a lot of good. They could have done more, they could have been better, and Blair destroyed his legacy by throwing his lot in with George W Bush and the Iraq War. But those were times when things were improving in the country and we looked to the future with positivity. It can be like that again.</p>\n<p>But it won’t — for decades at least — if we destroy our economy, hobble worker’s rights, and undercut food-safety regulations, by leaving the EU.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5198-march\">\nNote, for example, his complete absence from the country on the <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/22/march-in-october/\">day of the People’s Vote march</a>. <a href=\"#fnref-5198-march\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5198-cut\">\n“Measure twice, cut once,” as the old saying goes.

The main march started on Park Lane, so we were ahead of it, and it wasn’t clear to us whether the head of it had already passed us, or if not, then when it actually reached us. It looked like nothing was moving ahead of us. My assumption was that they hadn’t yet closed all the roads between us and Parliament Square, but there was no way to know for sure. Eventually we started moving.</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2262.jpeg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2262.thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"These noisy bastards were around all day\"></img></a>\n\n<p>The mood was universally peaceful and cheerful. There were hardly any police to be seen.</p>\n<p>I tried to post a couple of photos, but inevitably the network was swamped and nothing would work. I guess even if people weren’t trying to post, just that many phones trying to register with a cell tower would slow things down dramatically.</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2265.jpeg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2265.thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"An idea of the numbers\"></img></a>\n\n<h2>The Rally</h2>\n\n<p>By the time we got to Whitehall Parliament Square was full, and we couldn’t get in. The organisers had set up some big screen-and-speaker systems, so we could hear the speeches (at least when the hovering helicopters weren’t too close).</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2299.jpeg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2299.thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"Wee Nicola on screen\"></img></a>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>There isn’t one, really. Like I say, the Mayhemic leadership of the country won’t pay any attention. But if nothing else it helps to keep our spirits up in these dark days.</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2302.jpeg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2302.thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"rafalgar Square in the aftermath\"></img></a>\n\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I didn’t really know what to expect with this. I knew it was about, or set around, a party — in part because I’ve seen <cite><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274558/\">The Hours</a></cite>.</p>\n<p>But it’s about so much more; and not really about the party very much at all. It’s an intriguing look at the mental lives of a range of people in London on a day in the 1920s. Not a very wide range of people, in that they’re all very much upper-middle to upper class. There are a few people from what would have been called the lower classes, but they’re just passersby, background colour. There is, however, a sympathy towards all people — from at least some of the characters.</p>\n<p>Given the limited range of types of people, we get a remarkably effective insight into their mental lives. And it’s all done with reported thought. There is some actual dialogue, but very little. And we jump around from head to head promiscuously, but incredibly smoothly. There’s usually some handoff: the current viewpoint character sees someone, and then we’re in that person’s head. Or they might just think about someone, and now we hear the other person’s thoughts.</p>\n<p>I guess this, along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce\">Joyce</a>, is one of the originators of the stream of consciousness as a literary device. An  interesting thing to me is how it reminded me of other, later, works; which of course shows its influence. Most noticeable: <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/04/10/the-illuminatus-trilogy-by-robert-shea-and-robert-anton-wilson-books-2018-7/\">Illuminatus</a>!</cite> Now <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson\">Robert Anton Wilson</a> was a Joyce scholar, so he was probably coming more from that direction, but there are definitely some similarities of style, or at least echoes.</p>\n<p>And — also from this year’s rereading — <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/08/01/walking-on-glass-by-iain-banks-books-2018-18/\">Walking On Glass</a></cite>. Especially in the contrast between the thoughts of people who are or are not “sane.”</p>\n<p>It can be surprisingly confusing at times, such as when someone suddenly thinks  of a person or an idea that hasn’t been mentioned before. But that just simulates the way our minds work. Our thoughts jump from topic to topic without an introductory paragraph, after all.</p>\n<p>So it’s psychology, feminism, and a critique of (parts of) the British class system. Oh, and it’s also partly a love-letter to London. I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I don’t know where I learned about this. It’s been sitting on my Kindle for a while. I have a feeling that a friend recommended it on Facebook. It’s subtitled “An Hallucinated Oral History of the Post-Punk Scene in Airdrie, Coatbridge and Environs 1978–1986,” which annoys me, but only because of that “<strong>An</strong> Hallucinated.” Not because it’s a subtitle. I like subtitles.</p>\n<p>And this subtitle describes its book extremely well, especially with respect to that incorrectly-articled vision. It’s the fictionalised biography of a band called Memorial Device. Or at least that’s partly what it is. It verges on magic realism at times. It’s presented as a series of interviews and parts written by other contributors (as opposed to the supposed author, “Ross Raymond”). The actual author does a fine job of presenting those different voices and making them <em>sound</em> different. The whole thing reads like an actual music biography where the author has drawn on the experiences of a range of people as well as their own experience.</p>\n<p>The hallucinatory part comes from the way some of those people speak, or write. They are variously damaged or otherwise otherworldly, and their mental strangeness comes across well — or is it the world that’s strange?</p>\n<p>Airdrie is in the west of Scotland, not far from Glasgow, so it’s very much the same part of the world I grew up in. This feels very realistic: there was a similar swathe of bands inspired by punk and the post-punk/new wave/new romantic scene around Dumbarton and environs. None of the characters were as much larger-than-life as some of the members of Memorial Device — or at least not that I knew — but that’s why this is fictional, I guess.</p>\n<p>Not the best thing I’ve read this, year, but not bad.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Gutenberg is a change to the web-based editor in the WordPress dashboard, not a separate app. I typed up my <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/09/01/chile-trip-part-1-there-and-back/\">previous post</a> in <a href=\"https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/\">MarsEdit</a>, as is my wont, and uploaded it.

				"title": "Chile Trip Part 1: There and Back",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>We’re not long back from a family holiday to Chile. I plan to write several posts about it. I’m going to take a thematic approach, rather than a purely chronological or location-based one. Though some will be that kind, too. There will be pictures, but not so much in this post, as it’s about planes, airports, etc.</p>\n<p>First, then, the whole business of travelling to another continent, and to the southern hemisphere of our amazing planet.</p>\n<h2>Getting There</h2>\n<p>We flew on Latin American Airlines, or LATAM. They were pretty good. I have no complaints. Maybe not as good as British Airways to New York a few years ago, but certainly much better than the budget airlines. The only thing was that we couldn’t get a direct flight. There just don’t seem to be any to Santiago. Though a taxi driver told us towards the end of our stay that BA have one direct flight a week. If so, then either we didn’t find it, it was on an inconvenient day, or it was really expensive. Or any combination of those.</p>\n<p>So we had a multipart flight out: first to São Paulo, then on to Santiago via Rosario. That was just a stop at another airport, without leaving the plane. Though some confusion in the booking system meant that we had different seats for the second part. We were not alone: it was all a bit chaotic, as new people boarded and wanted to sit in already-occupied seats, as people who were staying on didn’t realise they had to move. Still, it got sorted out.</p>\n<p>Also I didn’t realise till later that Rosario is actually in Argentina. It doesn’t count as visiting a country if you stay airside, but still, interesting to have touched down in two more countries than we planned to.</p>\n<p>Above all, it’s a <em>long</em> journey. Around 6000 miles, and about 22 hours, if memory serves.</p>\n<h2>Jet Lag</h2>\n<p>We didn’t suffer too much from jet lag going out. Except… almost every day for the entire three weeks I woke up around 4 in the morning. Usually got back to sleep OK. Our clock-time confusion was confounded after about a week when the clocks in Chile went forward by an hour. It’s the tail end of winter there, so it’s the start of summer time. But it’s earlier than when clocks in Europe change, relatively. Also it was <em>only</em> Chile: in Bolivia and Brazil the time was unchanged.</p>\n<h2>Taxis Home and Abroad</h2>\n<p>While I’m on travel I’ll just touch on taxis. Chilean taxi drivers, in common with those all over Europe, get out of their car and help you load your bags into the boot. This happens everywhere; except Britain. Or at least, except London. When we were getting a cab when we were coming home I was struck by the fact that all these people were struggling into the stupidly-designed-for-luggage black cabs with no help from the driver.</p>\n<p>And then I was ashamed when it was our turn, and the driver <em>did</em> get out and help us. But it’s uncommon.</p>\n<h2>Internal Flights</h2>\n<p>Chile is distinctive on the map for its length. It runs almost the entire length of the continent. So there are some long distances to travel if you want to see much of it. As it is, I couldn’t say that we saw <em>much</em> of it, but we did see some very distinctive areas. Notably the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert\">Atacama Desert</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Lagos_Region\">Lakes region</a>.</p>\n<p>They’re quite far apart, though, so we took some internal flights. All by LATAM (we should have signed up for their frequent-flyer programme), and all fine. Security at the airports was generally less intrusive than it is here. We didn’t have to take iPads out of carry-ons, and I once went through security with my metal water bottle full! Radical.</p>\n<h2>Long(ish) Distance Buses</h2>\n<p>The only other trip we took was from Santiago to Valparaíso, which was by bus (coach). A couple of hours. Very comfortable, if you could avoid hitting your head on the badly-designed overhead screens.</p>\n<h2>Santiago Metro and Valparaíso Light Rail</h2>\n<p>Santiago has a decent Metro system. You get a contactless card like London’s Oyster cards, called <em>Bip!</em>. Which is a great name, in my humble opinion. It also has the advantage over Oyster that you can make multiple journeys simultaneously with one card. So for a family of four, for example, you just put enough money on the card for everyone, and tap in four times.</p>\n<p>I don’t really know why Oyster doesn’t support this. My only guess would be that they thought it would cause too many complaints with people accidentally being charged twice.</p>\n<h2>Return</h2>\n<p>Coming back took even longer: 23 hours in airports and planes, but 27, 28, if you count getting to and from the airports.</p>\n<p>The weird thing here was that we flew from Santiago to Rio de Janeiro; then, after a four or five hour stopover, to São Paulo. An hour and a half there, and finally on to Heathrow. I don’t understand why it was like that, but as I recall it was the only available option when we booked the flights.</p>\n<p>The annoying part was that — seemingly because the Rio – São Paulo bit was a domestic flight — we had to collect our luggage in Rio, and then check it back in. We went landside, got Brazilian entry stamps in our passports, all that.</p>\n<p>We took off for Heathrow at 22:10, which made it 02:10 in the UK. So I wanted to get to sleep, but first I wanted to eat. On these long flights, though, they don’t rush to serve food like they do on a short European flight. So it was, I think, around 4 am before I could close my eyes.</p>\n<p>Adjusting back home wasn’t too bad, though. People always say it’s worse coming east, but, apart from sleeping late on Bank Holiday Monday, I didn’t have too much trouble.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

But when I was about a third through this, I had a dawning realisation: this appeared not to be science fiction.  The Clarke Award being for the best <em>SF</em> novel of the year, of course.</p>\n<p>At that point there were, to my reckoning, two things that don’t quite exist in the real world today: a self-driving car, and a kind of personal health sensor that can tell how much you drank last night, and if you’re pregnant. Neither is key to the plot or anything else, though.</p>\n<p>There was also a hint that global warming has taken a turn for the worse. But it could just be a year with a bad crop, and anyway, that’s hardly fiction, never mind SF.</p>\n<p>But then I hit part two, and it jumped forward 50 years, with corresponding technological advances. Part three takes us forward another fifty or so years.</p>\n<p>So what we have is a series of vignettes about the experiences of several interlinked families, over a hundred or so years. It’s interesting enough, but it’s limited. It’s about families and the future of how humans conceive, bear (or not), and raise children. Which is fine. But there’s very little about what else is going on in the world, in society. Or even much about the societal effects of the technologies we <em>are</em> looking at. Yes, by the end there are reports of a visibly-pregnant woman being abused in public for giving her baby a bad start in life (by not using the artificial uterus technology and associated genetic cleansing). But that’s it.</p>\n<p>It’s interesting enough, as far as it goes, but I’ve got to admit I’m surprised the judges considered it the best SF novel published in Britain in 2017.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>A novel of three parts. Two of them are — probably — tightly linked. By some interpretations, anyway. The third — which is the first as presented — brushes up against one of those two, and is to a small extent influenced by it. But in no way that I can discern is it really linked to the others. Which kind of makes me wonder what it’s for.</p>\n<p>I mean, sure, maybe he just wanted to tell that story, with no more reason than that. That would be fine. But since the three are presented under one common title, I’ve got to assume that they share more than just a passing brush with simultaneous walks and some sugar in a tank.</p>\n<p>The title itself is interesting. The only people who are literally walking on glass at any point are the two exiles from a galactic war in the far future (if that’s really what they are). But glass suggests fragility, slipperiness: maybe everyone is walking on glass, as everything could collapse under them at any moment.</p>\n<p>It also suggests transparency: maybe everyone can be seen at any time. If you walk on a sheet of glass, you can be viewed from below. Which sounds not unlike the crosstime telepathic viewing that people in the castle are apparently doing of people in Earth’s past.</p>\n<p>All of which leads me to the conclusion — which I didn’t actually expect when I started writing this — that my long-preferred interpretation is the correct one: that Quiss and Ajayi really are former warriors who have been banished to the castle as a punishment for misdeeds. The castle has the technology to let people live vicariously in the minds of humans from its past. At one point Quiss probably touches Grout’s mind and partly causes the road accident.</p>\n<p>Is Grout really an exile from the same war, or a similar one? Probably not, but maybe. Maybe someone like Quiss or Aliya touched his mind at some earlier, vulnerable time, and something of their experience passed in to Grout.</p>\n<p>But again, what of Graham’s story, and Sara’s betrayal? What does that have to do with the bigger stories?</p>\n<p>I remain unsure.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

The ones I know I read, but didn’t blog about, are <cite>The Bridge</cite>, <cite>The Crow Road</cite>, <cite>Excession</cite>, <cite>Look To Windward</cite>, and <cite>The State of the Art</cite> — or at least the title story.</p>\n<p>As to why I didn’t blog about them, I guess I just didn’t write about my reading in some years. But it’s oddly lax of me. Blogging about them was kind of the point of the reread, surely — as well as my own enjoyment, of course.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all these posts are now tagged with “<a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/tag/the-great-banksie-reread/\">The Great Banksie Reread</a>“.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Like this function or this expression; or my typical thing, “would this work” or how the fuck was that syntax again?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve sometimes found that they have a downside. When you are looking for code examples, then if a language has a REPL, very often the examples show the use of a feature <em>in</em> the REPL. Which may be fine, but is not so helpful if you’re trying to find out how to construct a class or a function.</p>\n<p>Which point, to be fair, Hjertnes does address:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  In other words, if your language require a lot of “foreplay” to run code, like declaring a namespace and a class etc (I’m looking at you Java and C#) it will probably not be the right thing. But if you can evaluate code without much fuss it is.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Java is supposed to be getting one soon, I believe, if it’s not already in version 9.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

And  “I must convince dad to get a VTR.” Who ever called it a V<em>T</em>R, rather than V<em>C</em>R? Outside of TV companies, at least.</p>\n<p>Still a great, crazy story with an ending that, now, seems less believable than it ever did. Well, the whole setup, really: the idea that you could have a child and not register them, and keep them away from all need for interaction with the authorities. Even if you lived on a private island, that’s hard to imagine nowadays.</p>\n<p>And I had forgotten what a misogynistic character the narrator, Frank, is. Which is, frankly, ironic.</p>\n<p>I recall reading a theory once that Eric, the crazy, dog-burning brother, doesn’t actually exist, that he was all a figment of Frank’s supercharged imagination. I was keeping that at the back of my mind as I read this time, and I don’t think there’s much evidence of it. But I’ll see if I can track down the actual theory.</p>\n<p>Here we go: <a href=\"https://performativeutterance.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/the-weaponry-of-deceit/\">“The Weaponry of Deceit: Speculations on Reality in <cite>The Wasp Factory</cite>” by Kev McVeigh</a>. Originally published in the BSFA’s <cite>Vector</cite> magazine.</p>\n<p>Reading it again now, McVeigh has a point: Eric can be seen as a metaphor for Frank’s masculinity. But I prefer to take it at face value: sometimes a crazy family is just a crazy family.</p>\n<p>The difficulty in searching for anything to do with this novel nowadays is that it’s on the English Literature curricula of both the English A-Levels and the Scottish Highers. So there are lots (and lots and lots) of sites offering analyses of it for students to <strike>plagiarise</strike> learn from. As well as all the Goodreads entries and blog posts you would expect.</p>\n<p>And, <em>oops</em>! I’ve just added to the pile.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I was a little late. I went straight to Oxford Circus. I came out of the tube station and just stood and watched the people walking down Regent Street. It was amazing, and seemed endless. Then I saw these two with great signs:</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1911.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1911.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protestors with signs: 'If Adolph (sic) Hitler flew in today... They'd send a limousine anyway'; and 'Bloody Trump, combing over hair, taking our tax money.'\"></img></a>\n\n<p>A Clash quote and a bad pun? Count me in.</p>\n\n<p>I walked down the pavement alongside the march for a bit, taking more photos.</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1915.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1915.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protestors, London, July 2018\"></img></a>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1921.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1921.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protestors, London, July 2018\"></img></a>\n\n<p>Before long we got to Trafalgar Square.</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1927.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1927.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protestors in Trafalgar Square, London, July 2018\"></img></a>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1949.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1949.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protestors in Trafalgar Square, London, July 2018\"></img></a>\n\n<p>There were many speakers and a few musicians. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_McCluskey\">Len McCluskey</a> told us that the police had estimated the crowd was over 250,000, which was surprising, since they tend to underestimate. Anyway, if so, it was the biggest since the Iraq war demo. More amusingly, we were a bigger crowd than at Trump’s inauguration.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I looked around and it didn’t feel that crowded. I’ve seen the O2 full, and I would guess that there were a similar 20,000 in the square.</p>\n\n<p>But it turned out when I left that there were many, many people in the streets around the square. I guess they didn’t want to push forward because the square looked full. I’m quite glad about that.</p>\n\n<p>The atmosphere was fantastic all day. The police presence was pleasingly low (or at least low-key), despite the stories of leave being cancelled and people drafted in from all over the country.</p>\n\n<p>Did it do any good? Probably not, in the sense that it won’t have any direct effect on Trump. But it made a \nlot of people feel good, and it showed the world that we care.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>This is not a book about an imaginary rock musician: it’s a book about guilt.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is about an imaginary rock musician too, but reading it now, for the third or perhaps fourth time, it’s striking to me how totally it’s about guilt. And not very subtly, either. It’s right there at the start of chapter 2:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Guilt. The big G, the Catholic faith’s greatest gift to humankind and its subspecies, psychiatrists . . . well, I guess that’s putting it a little too harshly; I’ve met a lot of Jews and they seem to have just as hard a time of it as we do, and they’ve been around longer\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I had forgotten that the character of Daniel Weir (or “Weird”) was brought up as a Catholic. I don’t think any of Banksie’s other characters were. The man himself wasn’t. Not that it makes a lot of difference: his (and our) Scottishness has a lot more impact on his character — and his characters — than any religion his parents may have had.</p>\n<p>As always, I had forgotten some key parts, but I remembered more of this than of most. It’s still great.</p>\n<p>And I realise that these notes are becoming more about me, and what I remember, than about the books. But that’s fine. It’s my blog, after all, and as much as anything these <em>are</em> for me. They’re just out there in public in case anyone else is interested.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you haven’t read any Banks, then this would be a damn fine place to start. Though it’s interesting to note that — set as it is in the 70s and early 80s — it’s so dated that it feels almost like a period piece. One example: one of the members of the band buys an IBM mainframe and transfers recording-studio tapes to it, so he can play any track at the touch of a button. Something we can do from our pocket computers today.</p>\n<p>But there was one point that I thought seemed anachronistic. Maybe not, but aluminium takeaway cartons? Chinese &amp; curries? In 1973? Hmmm. I mean, it is in the foaming metropolis of Paisley, not Balloch. And even we had a Chinese by 1980, 81, or so. Still, I wonder when those things started to become commonplace.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I think I’ve read it twice before, but (and you won’t be surprised here if you’ve been following along) I don’t remember much about it.</p>\n<p>I didn’t recall, for example, that Sharrow, the protagonist, was a noble; or that it’s set as we approach the decamillenium on and around what I at first assumed to be an Earth colony, although one that is long detached from Earth. And it’s in a similar state to the last one I read, <cite>Feersum Endjinn</cite>, in that we’re in a decadent stage, where technology was more advanced in the past, but things have been lost or forgotten.</p>\n<p>The most notable example of that, of course, is the Lazy Gun, the big maguffin at the heart of the story. I had thought it was semi-mystical, or at least alien in origin. But now I think maybe not, it’s just from the more advanced past.</p>\n<p>Turns out it’s not anything to do with Earth, of course. Golter is a planet round an extra-galactic star. The million-light-year distance to any other star seems to be the “dark background” of the title. Though I still don’t really get why it’s called that.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I still loved it. And strangely the ending felt less bleak than I had remembered. Though it’s still pretty dark. And it turns out he <a href=\"http://www.rulit.me/books/against-a-dark-background-epilogue-read-290563-1.html\">published an epilogue online</a>.

But this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In the pre-git era, you updated your software annually and sent customers floppy disks. But if you’re running a big software platform, you might update your servers constantly—many times a day or every 20 minutes.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>is a bit over the top. There were a lot of changes between sending out floppies and continuous deployment.</p>\n<p>I question his (lack of) capitalisation. The command is <code>git</code>, all lower case. But if you’re talking about the application, you should spell it “Git”, with the capital. I think so, anyway. You would write about “CVS”, even though the command was (is) <code>cvs</code>; and “Subversion,” with the command <code>svn</code>. But at least it’s not as annoying as people who write it in all-caps.</p>\n<p>Lastly, when he says, “Computers are mercurial,” I’m assuming he’s wryly referencing what was once <a href=\"https://www.mercurial-scm.org\">Git’s major rival</a> in the distributed version-control space.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Email apps, especially ones that offer advanced services like “send later,” may be storing our usernames and passwords on their servers.</p>\n<p>To be clear what that means: if you use Gmail, for example, you put your Google username and password into the app when you set it up. You expect the app to store them securely on your device. But some apps may also be storing that username and password — your keys to all the Google services in this example — on computers owned by the company that makes the app. Computers over which neither you nor Google has any control.</p>\n<p>I’m not suggesting that the company I talk about below, or any other, is doing anything nefarious. They <em>need</em> to be able to log in to your mail server in order to send your mail later. But I hadn’t realised until now what that means, and I’m guessing neither will a lot of people.  And to my mind they don’t make what they’re doing clear enough.</p>\n<p>Worst of all, having passwords stored on unknown servers — at the very least, that’s worrying.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/connected/194\">episode194</a> of the <cite>Connected</cite> podcast, <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/people/mykehurley\">Myke Hurley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/people/federicoviticci\">Federico Viticci</a> were reviewing the latest version of the iOS (and Mac) app <a href=\"https://sparkmailapp.com\">Spark</a>. It’s a fine email app, which I was using on my iPhone and iPad. So I was alarmed when they mentioned in passing that mail handled by the app is routed through <a href=\"https://readdle.com\">Readdle’s</a> servers. That didn’t seem likely at first. Spark is an email <em>client</em>. You tell it what servers handle your mail, and it connects to them to receive and send. The servers belonging to the company that makes the app have no business getting involved in that.</p>\n<p>I did some digging. Whether or not <a href=\"https://mykewasright.com\">Myke was right</a>™ about mail going through their servers, the reality turned out to be much worse.</p>\n<h2>Digging</h2>\n<p>I tweeted at the Spark account. Here’s what happened:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SparkMailApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SparkMailApp</a> Hi, I was listening to a podcast today on which it was suggested that if I use Spark, then my email is routed through your servers.

Without such access, our Product won’t be able to provide you with the necessary communication experience. In order for you to take full advantage of additional App and Service features, such as “send later”, “sync between devices” and where allowed by Apple – “push notifications” we use Spark Services. Without using these services, none of the features mentioned above will function.\n</blockquote>\n<p>The wording “Spark requires your credentials to log into your mail system in order to receive, search, compose and send email messages” suggests that Spark the <em>app</em> needs to log into your server, which it does. But nothing about that says that your credentials will be stored on their servers.</p>\n<p>Further down, in point 4, “How Long Personal Data is Stored For,” in a table that includes “Type of information,” we see (emphasis mine) :</p>\n<blockquote>\n  Email address, email content for Spark Services, <strong>mail server credentials</strong>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So there it is. They do store your username and password on their servers, and they do tell you; though only if you read well into the kind of document that notoriously goes unread.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>For features like “send later” they need to store the fact that you want to send an email at a specific time, and log in to your server in order to send it. And to be fair, I’m sure they can’t be alone in keeping that kind of data. Lots of clients offer “send later” and similar services, and all of them will have to log in to your mail server to work. So they have to store your credentials on <em>their</em> servers to do it.</p>\n<p>And consider, if you use Gmail, that means your username and password not just for Gmail, but for <em>all</em> Google’s services, are now stored on somebody else’s servers. Their security might be great, but how do we know?</p>\n<p>The more I think about this, the more concerned I become. Passwords should only be stored in one place: a secure, trusted password manager. But above all, these services need to be much clearer about the fact that they’re storing our passwords.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

The loopers do their killing and body-disposal in the past, but by the time Bruce Willis comes into it, everyone involved is in the same time, 2044, the past of the movie.</p>\n<p>Also I thought I had heard that it wasn’t well thought of, but <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/looper/\">Rotten Tomatoes has it at 82% from audiences and 93% from critics</a>. That’s pretty good, isn’t it?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarysue.com/looper-review/\">This review at The Mary Sue</a> is  good on the weak points. Some interesting discussion in the comments, too.</p>\n<p>The future was unconvincing — people still driving petrol-burning cars in 2044 and 2074? And the status of women was terrible. You can be a sex worker or a farming mom in future America. I mean, OK, we didn’t see the rest of society, but it’s not great. And a major Bechdel fail. Oh yes, and: the currency is silver? Actual, metallic silver? Time travel has really messed things up.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed it on the whole, though, and the ending is great. We could have done without the voiceover, but maybe Rian Johnson, the director, has  plans to release a cut without it in one possible future. Now where have I come across that idea before?</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"title": "Top-Ten Album Lists",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Two album-related memes have been doing the rounds on Facebook lately. Both involve posting cover images of ten favourite albums across ten days. One involves doing so without any comment, but the more interesting one to me involves the poster writing about their thoughts on each album. I was nominated by my friend <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006622569425\">Peter</a> to join in with the long-form version.</p>\n<p>I’m all about owning my own content, as you know, and not having it locked away in Facebook’s walled garden. So my plan is to write about ten albums, but to do so here, on my blog. Links to the posts will automatically be crossposted to Facebook anyway.</p>\n<p>I started compiling a list of possibles, and thinking about starting to write posts. First I decided to restrict it one per artist. Otherwise I could just pick five by The Beatles and five by The Clash.</p>\n<p>But then I played some albums, and thought some more.</p>\n<p>See, I knew right up front that it was going to be almost entirely a white-guy fest. I wanted to approach it honestly, and not try to appear to be anything I’m not, so that’s how it would have to be. It would be reflecting my life as a music fan. As it stands the long list has one woman and no non-white people.</p>\n<p>But as I played those albums — albums I love — and as I thought about them, I realised two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I know these albums too well. I’m not <em>bored</em> of them, but they can drift past without me really being aware of them, through overfamiliarity.</li>\n<li>This won’t be very interesting, and certainly won’t have any surprises for anyone who knows me.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So I’ve come to a decision, I think: I’m going to do it slightly differently. I’m going to write about ten albums that I like <em>now</em>. Ones that I’ve discovered in the last few years, maybe, or that I’ve known for a while but have listened to a lot more in recent years.</p>\n<p>I’m not entirely sure what that list is going to look like. I only have two, maybe three definites on it at the moment, and it’s going to take a while to construct it. But I think it could be a much more interesting list — certainly for me — when it’s done.</p>\n<p>And I’ll do a post with a rundown of what the original list <em>would</em> have been, just for completeness.</p>\n<p>So watch out for those in the next few days.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>This is a great story about how some people have to fix things in the aftermath of something they did that may change the world fundamentally, if not destroy it. With that description it sounds very similar to Ellis’s earlier webcomic (with Paul Duffield), <a href=\"http://www.freakangels.com\">Freak Angels</a>.</p>\n<p>Which is a fair enough assessment, though the triggering event in this case is a combination of AI, the internet, and old magic; as opposed to the psychic powers in the older work. Ellis has deeply embedded the “start late” advice often given to aspiring authors. Both of the works under discussion, and some of his others, start long after the events that set their plots in motion.</p>\n<p>It can be a very effective device. We get to know characters who already know each other, and the past events are revealed gradually, through conversation and flashbacks. And the fact that the protagonists don’t at first fully understand what they did means that we learn along with them.</p>\n<p>This is great, but the only frustrating thing is that these three volumes — comprising fifteen issues of the comic — are to date all that there is. I don’t know if they plan to continue it, but the last issue came out in November, and the story is far from over. Googling has not so far revealed the answer to this.</p>\n<p>Recommended, though.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"title": "Tab Convert",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>That’s <strong>con</strong>vert, with the stress on the first syllable. The noun, in other words. As in, “I am a tab convert.” A convert, that is, to using tabs for indentation of source code, instead of spaces.</p>\n<h2>A Background of Spaces</h2>\n<p>From the earliest time that I learned about the tabs vs spaces debate, I’ve been a spaces guy. This is at least partly because of the influence of my then-colleague <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/author/benjamin-geer\">Benjamin Geer</a>. He has gone on to other, no doubt better, things, but he was probably the best programmer I’ve ever worked with. He introduced me to the idea that you should always use four spaces for indentation. The reason being that if you use tabs, people can have their editor’s tab size set to all sorts of different values, and it leads to source files not looking as you expect them to.</p>\n<p>Whereas spaces are spaces: you can’t go wrong with a space (or four).</p>\n<p>I’ve changed, though. I have become a convert, in my job, and maybe philosophically, to tabs.</p>\n<h2>Stack Overflow Survey</h2>\n<p>About a year ago there was a <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017\">survey of developers on Stack Overflow</a>. Among many questions, they asked about whether people used spaces or tabs. The <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/\">detail that got most attention</a> was that developers who use spaces were paid more on average than those who use tabs. I strongly suspect that correlation is not causation in this case, but it seemed noteworthy at the time.</p>\n<p>More interesting to me was the fact that <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#work-tabs-or-spaces\">more people used tabs</a>, at 42.9% against 37.8%. I was surprised: I thought spaces had won years ago. Though I often wondered (<a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/04/28/3353/\">sometimes publicly</a>, and I’m surprised to see that was only last year) why the default setting for Eclipse was tabs.</p>\n<p>Maybe that default, and others like it, is part of the reason for the statistics. Most people don’t change defaults. On the other hand, surely developers are the kind of people who are <em>most likely</em> to change defaults?</p>\n<p>Anyway, after the survey came out there were various posts about it, notably <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/15/spaces-vs-tabs\">John Gruber</a>, who said he was “a devout user of tabs”. OK, he’s not a developer these days, but there were others who are who said similar things. The one that struck me was one that I can’t locate now that said “tabs are semantic.” In other words, pressing the tab key means “indent here.” Four spaces means… four spaces? Could be an indentation, could be something else.</p>\n<h2>Everything Changes Imperially</h2>\n<p>So I was primed for the idea of switching to tabs, even though I still used spaces in <a href=\"http://tinlion.software/products/pertwee/\">my own projects</a>. And then I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/03/03/imperial-adventures/\">started my new job at Imperial College</a>. When I first started looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility\">the code</a>, I quickly realised that it was indented with tabs throughout. I checked with my co-worker who is the main contributor. He didn’t mind, but they had always used tabs.</p>\n<p>Obviously I didn’t want to introduce a mixture. That’s what <em>really</em> messes up the display of code in different editors. You have to be consistent within a project. So if I were to change the project to spaces I would have to change every file. That was an unnecessary step; and per the above, I was primed to use tabs. They’re semantic, after all.</p>\n<p>I switched my IDE to indent using tabs, with the tab-stop value set to 4. And so we proceed, tabbing away merrily.</p>\n<p>So far I prefer it this way.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Seriously, during the first part it felt like it was targeted right at me.</p>\n<p>I am, as you probably know, a <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2015/01/05/the-illuminatus-trilogy-by-robert-shea-and-robert-anton-wilson-books-2014-17/\">fan and repeat reader of <cite>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</cite></a>. As clearly are Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, or the KLF, as they used to be known. This book is — what, a spoof of, a homage to? — <cite>Illuminatus</cite>. Explicitly modelled on it, referring back to it constantly.</p>\n<p>Plus there are lots of Beatles references, and I’ve been into them for even longer. Then among the characters are Alan Moore, who (in this corner of the multiverse) is a member — along with Cauty and Drummond — of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Noise_Terror\">Extreme Noise Terror</a>. Our world’s version of that band did collaborate with the KLF, but as far as I can tell they had no connection with Moore.</p>\n<p>So don’t expect to get too much accurate information about popular culture out of this. Plenty of references, though. Other characters include Michelle O’Bama, M’Lady Gaga, Yoko Ono (two versions), Lady Penelope, and her chauffeur/hitman Aloysius Parker.</p>\n<p>It’s a lot of fun. The downside is that it’s not very well written, at least as far as the dialogue is concerned. Most notable is the complete absence of contractions. Which is fine for an odd thing, or maybe to give one character a particular voice, but when no-one uses them, it all gets a little strange.</p>\n<p>The story is fun, though, and I finished it and immediately started rereading <cite>Illuminatus</cite> yet again, so there’s that.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Just over a month ago I posted a <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/02/01/4158/\">brief note</a> about job news, saying that more details would be forthcoming. I was, as I said then, just waiting for some paperwork.</p>\n<p>It took longer than I expected to get that paperwork sorted out, but I received and returned the contract yesterday afternoon. On Monday I start work at the <a href=\"http://www.sahsu.org\">Small Area Health Statistics Unit</a> (SAHSU), part of the School of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College.</p>\n<p>That’s quite a mouthful, but in short I’ll be working on programming something called the <a href=\"https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility\">The Rapid Inquiry Facility</a> (RIF), which is an open-source tool for studying health statistics.</p>\n<p>I’m neither a medical researcher nor a statistician, but I am a programmer (or a software engineer, if you want to be fancy). Our job is to understand the needs of someone — usually referred to as “the business,” but I’m guessing that will be different in my new job — and translate those needs into actions in software. That basic definition doesn’t change according to the problem domain. Whether it’s sending payments from one bank to another, checking a person’s right to work on a government database, or doing something with statistical data about health issues, the programmer’s job is to understand what the user needs and make things happen on a screen.</p>\n<p>The big difference for me, I think, will be that in this new role I’ll have the chance to contribute to doing something good in the world. As I said at my interview, I’ve mainly worked in financial software, and while, sure, people need banks, it wasn’t the most socially-usefully thing. The last half-year working at the Home Office had some value, but I was a tiny cog in a huge machine.</p>\n<p>At Imperial I’ll be able to feel that I’m actually contributing something useful to society, as well as doing what should be really interesting work.</p>\n<p>Oh, and: I’ll be back in Paddington, which I know from my Misys days, and it’s a much shorter commute than to Croydon.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"title": "I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead: The Dirty Life and Times of Warren Zevon by Crystal Zevon (Books 2018, 2) 📚🎵",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>You know how they say you shouldn’t meet your heroes? Well it turns out that sometimes that includes not meeting them between the pages of a book. I’m not sure I’d  call Warren Zevon a hero, but he’s definitely a hugely respected and much missed singer and songwriter.</p>\n<p>I knew of the tales of wild and crazy behaviour, though I hadn’t actually read any of them — except inasmuch as they come out in the songs. And anyway, those tales are a dime a dozen in rock’n'roll. A lot of this biography, though, is concerned with the people he hurt.</p>\n<p>Which is fine, not least since the author — his wife and the mother of one of his children — is a major one of those people. Most of his bad behaviour happened while he was an alcoholic — or while he was drinking, I suppose I should say, since the standard twelve-step narrative is that you never stop being one. Alcoholics Anonymous helped him to stop, though he eventually stopped going to meetings. He didn’t drink for seventeen years, and the opening chapter tells us that when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer he had a scotch. Who could blame him for stepping off he wagon at a time like that?</p>\n<p>So he comes across as a far from pleasant character. But my disappointment with the book is more about the complete focus on the man and his relationships, almost to the exclusion of the music.</p>\n<p>“The man and his relationships” sounds like an important set of themes to address in a biography. But in the case of a creative person — or really any person worthy of a biography — a key part of the story of their life is their <em>works</em>. If it’s a writer you’ll expect to read about their books; a politician, their victories and defeats; a general their battles. And of course, a musician, their music. It would be strange to read a biography of Beethoven or the Beatles that told of their personal lives but largely elided the music.</p>\n<p>Which may be the key: this isn’t a <em>biography</em>, as such. It makes no attempt to be comprehensive, and there’s no real narrative. Although there are plenty of reminiscences from Crystal, the vast bulk of the book is reminiscences from people in Zevon’s life, directly quoted and preceded with their names; almost like a play script. Presumably Crystal interviewed them all, but she herself comes across as just one of the interviewees.</p>\n<p>There are quotes from Zevon’s diaries, but he either wrote them in a very fragmented, abbreviated way, or they have been heavily edited. An example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Jan. 12, 1975<br>\n    … Took Jordan, visited Father at the steam baths. He gave me a handsome Seiko watch and $135 … quarreling with Crystal … T-Bone came over for spaghetti and I quaffed vodka martinis all night. T-Bone trounced me soundly at chess which surprised and aggravated me, but pleased me, too, by mellowing my lonely-giant-of-the-intellect trip … Made love.<br>\n  <br>\n  Jan. 15, 1975<br>\n    … Snorted coke which kept Crystal awake all night … she’s thinking of pregnancy and worried about chemicals in her body …\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>(All ellipses in original.)</p>\n<p>After he gets sober the diary entries become more frequent, which is good. But as a fan of his music, I would have liked to read a lot more about it: its creation, how it was accepted or not at the time, stories of gigs and recording studios, and all that. Unfortunately Crystal wasn’t really involved in that part of his life, and the interviewees who were — like Jorge Calderón or Jackson Brown — either weren’t asked to talk about it, or weren’t quoted doing so.</p>\n<p>So not quite the music biography I’d have liked, but not without interest.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

That is both true, and very remiss of me. Trouble is it’s now been quite a while since I saw them both.</p>\n<p>Still, I should be able to gather together a few memory cells.</p>\n<h2><cite>The Last Jedi</cite></h2>\n<p>I went on opening night, as <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/12/14/4017/\">I microblogged</a>.

There are some points that could have been done differently, or left out, or speeded up; and it had the weird effect towards the end of there being a series of times when I thought it was finished, and it still wasn’t. But all in all a fine work. Not as good as <cite>The Force Awakens</cite>, maybe. But that’s partly because that one raised our expectations so high.</p>\n<h2>‘Twice Upon A Time’</h2>\n<p>Peter Capaldi’s last episode. It was damn fine, loads of fun.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>The worst thing about this book is that it tells you, two or three chapters from the end, that it’s only the first half of the story. Now, I knew there are two other books in the series, but I expected the first book to be at least capable of standing alone. Turns out it isn’t: the ending leaves us hanging right after the big reveal.</p>\n<p>The other worst thing about this book is that I’m not really that compelled to read on. I mean, I probably will, but it’s not like when I read <cite><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion\">Hyperion</a></cite>, say, and had to scurry around the city trying to find a copy of the second volume.<sup id=\"fnref-6028-Hyperion\"><a href=\"#fn-6028-Hyperion\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>After all the fuss <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/26/publishers-and-sinners/\">about it not being published in the UK, and me not being able to get it</a>, I had high expectations. Probably too high, as it turns out.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong: it’s by no means a bad book, and it’s astonishingly accomplished for a first novel. I did enjoy reading it. Its true weakest point— ignore all that complaining above — is that it can be a little bit hard to understand the world she creates. Not impossible, though, and Palmer does go to some efforts to explain it with minimal infodumping. Or at least with infodumping disguised as a conversation with the reader, which works quite well.</p>\n<p>It’s about four hundred years in the future, and since the Church War some two hundred or so earlier, the world no longer exists as countries in the way that we know them. Instead people are members of one of seven “hives,” which they can choose to align themselves with at majority. Or not: some people are hiveless by choice.</p>\n<p>Countries mean less at least in part because of super-fast international transport by “cars,” which I think are probably suborbital rockets or similar. Though they may have a more advanced propulsion system. The most confusing thing is probably that the leaders of the seven hives are characters and each of them has several names. For any given one of them, each of the others might know them by a different nickname, and the narrator uses these interchangeably. It gets hard to keep track of who’s who.</p>\n<p>Global warming appears to have been conquered, or ameliorated to the point where it’s not a major concern. In fact it seems to be very close to a post-scarcity society. People only work at things they want to, and seem to be able to live OK without having to work.</p>\n<p>Apart from “Servicers,” that is. Our narrator, Mycroft Canner, is one of these. People convicted of sufficiently serious crimes can end up as one of these. They are essentially public slaves. They are required to work for seemingly anyone who asks them, and are paid in food and board — and occasionally other treats such as cinema tickets. But they have no other way to get these things.</p>\n<p>I found it quite a disturbing an idea; though it would almost certainly be better than being in prison; and at least they don’t have the death penalty.</p>\n<p>That’s not the most disturbing thing in the book. But I’ll say no more about that.</p>\n<p>As I write about it, my estimation of it is going up. Isn’t that strange? If I write enough about it I’ll probably stop to download <cite>Seven Surrenders</cite>, the next volume.</p>\n<p>Oh, yes, as I said, it says it’s “the first half” of Canner’s story; but there are two more volumes. Are they both short, or is the third one more standalone? There’s only one way to find out.</p>\n<p>But I have a stack of other things to read first. Also I realise I have no idea what the title has to do with the story. 📖</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-6028-Hyperion\">\nIf memory serves: it was a long time ago, and it may not have happened exactly like that. <a href=\"#fnref-6028-Hyperion\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

I was on the other side of the punk/metal wars, of course, and screechy vocals always put me off.</p>\n<p>I completely understand the spirit of that piece, though, and feel the same way about The Clash, the Velvet Underground, probably others.

I don’t know, maybe not; but this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  But we thought we were gonna live forever. The music too.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>is not how things were for me, for us. We didn’t think we’d live beyond the eighties.

He’s a decade older than me, but that still means he experienced the cold war.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s not generation, but location. I lived a few miles from the Faslane naval base, where the Polaris submarines were based (and where the Trident ones are still).

Which makes me surprised to read these stories about it not doing very well on opening weekend. And weirdly, from the <em>balcony</em>. I don’t know when I was last in a cinema with a balcony. I mean, the Rio, obviously, though probably not since <cite>Harry Potter 8</cite>; but I hadn’t been in the balcony before, and I don’t think I even realised that it had one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22310528_695400790653923_2498351281467612320_n.jpg\"></p>\n<p>But to the film of the moment. I tried to lower my expectations, I really did. But I’d read that <cite>Guardian</cite> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/blade-runner-2049-review-ryan-gosling-harrison-ford-denis-villeneuve\">review</a>, which was so unbelievably glowing. I listened to Mitch Benn <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_T9DqwB3e0\">hoping they wouldn’t fuck it up</a> and believed that they hadn’t.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_T9DqwB3e0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>But…</p>\n<p>OK, they <em>haven’t</em> fucked it up. But I’m going to have to break ranks with all the legions of newspaper reviewers who love it to death &amp; back (honestly, I can hardly find a bad, or even a mixed, review), and nearly everyone else.</p>\n<p>Because I didn’t enjoy it all that much. I spent a lot of the time (of which there is a <em>lot</em>) saying, “What the fuck is going on here? Why did they do that?” The former is fine, as long as it becomes clear over time, which it generally did. The latter less so: understanding characters’ motivations is fundamental to understanding and enjoying a work of fiction.</p>\n<p>But much worse than those: I spent some of the time bored.</p>\n<p>The main reason for that is that it’s paced like an 80s movie. Which is to say, much more slowly than we are used to today.</p>\n<p>I should have expected that, I suppose. The original <cite>Blade Runner</cite> moves slowly even by 80s standards. That’s part of its visual and storytelling style. So it’s reasonable that a sequel, even one thirty years later, should follow suit. But they could have picked the pace up <em>a bit</em>.</p>\n<p>The reviews all describe it as “thought-provoking” or similar, and it’s true that the questions of what it means to be human or to be artificial are in there. But to my mind there’s not enough of that. Which in a way is linked to another problem: world-building.</p>\n<p><aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-right\">\n        <p>It’s paced like an 80s movie</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside></p>\n<p>As before the world is very visually striking. What we have is the world of <cite>Blade Runner</cite> with thirty years of technological advancements. Like the film, the pace of advancement has been slow, but I suppose that’s not surprising, given how damaged the world is.</p>\n<p>But slowly or quickly, technology advances in parallel with a conversation <em>about</em> that technology. What’s missing here is any in-world debate about the legal and ethical status of replicants. Certainly there’s a nod to the idea that the casual use of “skin-job” is insulting and shouldn’t be used. But it never seemed that insulting anyway — indeed I think it’s only the voiceover version of the original that tells us it <em>is</em> an insult. Deckard likens it to the n-word. (He does so <em>using</em> that word, which, rightly, would not happen today.)</p>\n<p>In a more realistic world there would be a debate about replicants. There would be rights groups campaigning against using them as slaves, and even for them to be given full citizenship status. And from others there would be discrimination against them, abuse of them. That could all be going on in the background of this society — and the debate is not what the film is <em>about</em> — but I think a small acknowledgement that the debate existed would at least hint at a richer society.</p>\n<p><aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-left\">\n        <p>Technology advances in parallel with a conversation <em>about</em> that <br />technology.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside></p>\n\n<p>That all applies to the original too, of  course, but now it’s much more common for the replicants to be living among humans on Earth, so the conversation would be that much more active.</p>\n<p>And speaking of that commonality of the replicants on Earth, one question you might ask is, are there any humans actually left on Earth? Because only two characters appear to be unambiguously human.</p>\n<p>One is K’s boss in the LAPD, Lt Joshi, who could unknowingly be a replicant, though nothing suggests that. The other, Ana Stelline, who creates the memories that are implanted in replicants. She lives in isolation because of sensitivity to the environment, and the implication is that only a human can provide the memories. But since not all of the memories are actually hers, all that needs is gift for imaginative imagery. And, now that we know that replicants are fully-biological beings who can reproduce (whether only with each other or also with humans is unknown), then anything is possible.</p>\n<p>The situation appears to be that anyone with the money and without any disqualifying problem has left Earth. “A new life awaits you in the offworld colonies,” after all. I always suspected that the colonies would consist of grinding hardship based on subsistence farming, but I suppose the idea is you have replicant slaves to do the work.</p>\n<p>\n<aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-right\">\n        <p>There are no robots in these <br /> films.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside>\n</p>\n<p>The Earth that we see is incredibly empty. The original’s LA streets were packed with people, but now it seems sparsely populated at best. Empty highways — because of course nobody’s driving cars anymore. But the air is empty too. Mostly there’s only ever one car flying at a time. All those giant buildings might be filled with people, but you don’t get any sense of them being there.</p>\n<p>San Diego is a literal dump, and Las Vegas a nuclear wasteland. Apart from the still-standing casino hotel, of course. A million bottles of whisky and you choose Johnnie Walker Black Label? Come <em>on</em>. (That brand is owned by Diageo, though, which is the first of the big neon advertising signs you see.)</p>\n<p>I don’t know, I wonder if it was just my expectation of something more striking, more startling. Don’t get me wrong: I didn’t hate it, or even dislike it. I was just disappointed by it. Yet I think I want to see it again.</p>\n<p>I loved the music, by the way, though it was perhaps a bit overwhelming in places.</p>\n<p>\n<aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-left\">\n        <p>I think I want to see it again.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside>\n</p>\n<p>And as a last thought: I still see people talking about the replicants being ‘robots’ or ‘androids.’ If it wasn’t clear from the first film, where they bled what seemed to be blood, it is powerfully obvious now: there are no robots in these films. The replicants are fully biological. They are probably more like clones, genetically engineered for enhanced strength and stamina.</p>\n<p>The original book had androids (the clue was in the title); but not these films.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I skimmed part of it, but got annoyed when it seemed to be about rich Silicon Valley entrepreneurs deciding to go “off-grid.” That’s all very well for them, but most of us have to make a living.</p>\n<p>More pertinently, since the main target for the attack was Facebook, it annoyed me because I use Facebook to keep in touch with people that I might otherwise not. For that, it can be very good.</p>\n<p>And yet… it struck a chord with, me to some degree. I realised that Facebook has increasingly become more of a time sink than a pleasure. Not that I spend vast amounts of time on it each day, but when I do open it up, I often end up spending longer than I’d have wanted to. And not reading updates from friends and family, but following links to articles and quizzes and nonsense, most of which I wish I hadn’t bothered with.</p>\n<p>By comparison, a similar length of time spent in my feed reader lets me read blog pieces by people I actively want to hear from, and which I’m generally glad I’ve read.</p>\n<p>But they mostly aren’t friends and family.</p>\n<p>And then there’s the fact that the Facebook algorithm is tuned to show me what <em>it</em> thinks I should see, not what <em>I</em> want to see. What I want to see is all the updates from my friends, in reverse-chronological order. And that’s all. But there’s no guarantee that it will show me everything everyone posts, and the order is close to random at times.</p>\n<p>One way to work round this is to visit people’s individual Facebook pages. You could see all your the posts by all your friends by going to each of their profiles in turn. But that would mean you’d have to keep track of all that: remember who you visited and when, and somehow manage the list of people.</p>\n<p>Keeping track of things is what computers are good at. The software should be doing that for us.</p>\n<p>So I’m thinking that what I want is an app that will do that for me: that will keep a list of my Facebook friends, and show me all their posts (which of course is what Facebook used to do).</p>\n<p>As far as I know, no such app exists. This seems strange and unlikely, but I don’t think Facebook make a public API available for third-party clients, so such an app would have to work by scraping the web pages, which is neither good practice nor much fun.</p>\n<p>Of course, what this means is effectively turning Facebook back into a set of RSS feeds — or now, <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/07/24/some-open-source-software-for-your-delectation/\">especially as I have some experience with them</a>, a set of <a href=\"https://jsonfeed.org/\">JSON Feed feeds</a>. Which would then be usable in all sorts of other places.</p>\n<p>Web scraping may be bad and painful; still, I think I want to write this thing. Watch this space.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

There didn’t seem to be much that was optional about it.</p>\n<p>The Kickstarter connection, though: you’ll be familiar with the idea of ‘stretch goals.’ If not, the idea is that the basic target is to make X amount of money, but if we make X + 10%, or whatever, we’ll be able to do these other things. Develop additional features, make the item in more colours, or whatever. My guess is that the term originally comes from sports.</p>\n<p>So this email included in the subject the phrase ‘stretch targets.’ Meaning we want you to do more this week/month/whatever, than we originally planned. It was clearly written by someone who thinks that the way to develop software faster is to work your staff to the bone. When in fact that’s much more likely to result in people taking shortcuts and making mistakes.</p>\n<p>In this team they’re <em>already</em> working weekends, and now they’re being ‘stretched’ even more. It bodes ill. But perhaps co-opting the language of positive things for something so negative is worse.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><h2>Past</h2>\n<p>I can remember when I first saw <cite>Star Trek</cite>.</p>\n<p>That’s not so unusual, but if my memory is right — and I’ve just more or less confirmed that it is — then when I first saw it was the absolute first time anyone <em>could</em> see it, in this country, at least.</p>\n<p>Here’s the memory (and it’s tied up, as many good things are, with <cite>Doctor Who</cite>).</p>\n<p>It’s 1969. It’s the summer holidays, and we’re in a holiday home with a TV. That in itself makes me doubt the memory, because back then holiday houses just didn’t have TVs. A lot of houses in general didn’t. But this memory has always told me that we were on a family holiday. And it’s Saturday, late afternoon. I’m settling down at the TV, and somebody says — I think it’s my sister — ‘Martin, <cite>Doctor Who</cite> finished, remember?’ Because it was <cite>Doctor Who</cite> time.</p>\n<p>And I said, ‘But this is <em>like</em> <cite>Doctor Who</cite>!’</p>\n<p>And as the new programme started someone else — my Dad, I think — said, with a tone of surprise, ‘He knows all about it!’ And then the <cite>Enterprise</cite> swooshed towards me out of the screen.</p>\n<p>I’ve long wondered how true this memory was. It was 1969; I’d have been five. But I just <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/BBC\">checked</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Initially, the BBC was the first-run broadcaster of Star Trek (12 July 1969-15 December 1971).<br>\n  …<br>\n  The series was shown in four seasons, the first on Saturday evenings at 5:15 pm (in the time slot usually taken by Doctor Who).\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which exactly matches my memory: summer, Saturday, <cite>Doctor Who</cite> slot. And the calendar confirms that the 12th of July 1969 was a Saturday.</p>\n<p>I wouldn’t be five for another month plus. Not a bad bit of early-memory retention. I wouldn’t have remembered it at all, if it wasn’t for one thing: trauma caused by fear that my parents would turn the TV off just as this exciting new programme was starting burned it into my brain.</p>\n<p>My Dad always liked <cite>Star Trek</cite> too, so I guess I was partly responsible for that.</p>\n<h2>Present</h2>\n<p>Yesterday I watched the first two episodes of <cite>Star Trek: Discovery</cite>, which are on Netflix (in the UK and Europe, at least; in the US they’re on CBS’s own new streaming service). And I really enjoyed it. I wouldn’t say it felt like being that nearly-five-year-old again, but it did feel like they’re trying something new and potentially very exciting.</p>\n<p>Today I was looking at <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5171438/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">its entry on IMDB</a>. It turns out there are user-written reviews there, which I don’t think I’d been aware of before.</p>\n<p>Sadly they are almost universally negative. ‘It’s not <cite>Star Trek</cite>,’ is a common theme. But there’s a strong whiff of racism and misogyny coming through. Two non-white women as leads means ‘social justice warriors’ are running the show, it seems. Well from what I’ve read of Gene Roddenbery, I think he’d have been happy to be called a social justice warrior. <cite>Star Trek</cite> was <em>always</em> about diversity and tolerance.</p>\n<h2>Future</h2>\n<p>I don’t know how many episodes of this new series they have lined up, but I know I’m looking forward to watching them. So is my inner five-year-old. So would my Dad have been. And so would Gene.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>If you work with plain text, as I prefer to, then you probably try out different text editors from time to time (or, you know, constantly). I recently tried out a nice one called <a href=\"http://www.bear-writer.com\">Bear</a>. It’s an attractive environment to write in, syncs well between Mac, iPhone, and iPad, has good previewing and exporting features, as well as a host of different themes to suit your preferences. All in all, it’s got a lot going for it. I used it exclusively for a while, and paid the first month of its subscription.</p>\n<p>But I’m dropping it.</p>\n<p>The reason why is simple: although it’s all about plain text notes, it doesn’t store your notes as plain text <em>files</em>. Instead, it keeps them all in some kind of database and syncs that via iCloud.</p>\n<p>Using iCloud for syncing isn’t a problem, but locking my notes away in a form that’s not accessible to any other text editor definitely is.</p>\n<p>Its export features are good, so it’s not that your notes are locked away irretrievably. But while you’re using Bear, you can only edit your notes — or view them, for that matter — <em>in</em> Bear. And that’s just not how I want to work.</p>\n<p>It’s kind of antithetical to whole plain-text ethos, to my mind. You should be able to switch text editors without having to even think about it. Just open the file in the new editor and get on with it.</p>\n<p>Next I tried the unimaginatively-named <a href=\"https://www.notebooksapp.com\">Notebooks</a>. A similar setup with the syncing, but you can point it at a directory of files on the filesystem. It has its own strangenesses, though, in that it wants to keep tight control of the directory structure, and when you look at the directory in Finder or another text editor, you find it has been polluted with <code>plist</code> files, one for each plain-text file.</p>\n<p>So I dumped that one, too.</p>\n<p>And right now I’m trying <a href=\"https://ulyssesapp.com\">Ulysses</a>, which is very much of the moment, because it has just switched to subscription-based pricing, and caused much furore in doing so. I happen to also be trying out the <a href=\"https://setapp.com\">SetApp</a> service, which is interesting in itself, and which includes Ulysses as one of the apps it makes available.</p>\n<p>It’s fine, but is also prone to dropping the odd <code>plist</code> file in my folder, I see.</p>\n<p>In the end I’ll probably stick with <a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\">nvAlt</a> for short-form notes on the Mac, using a folder synced via Dropbox, and <a href=\"http://omz-software.com/editorial/\">Editorial</a> on iOS. Not forgetting <a href=\"https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/\">Drafts</a> on iOS, of course, but you only type things there to export them somewhere else, really. And then <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html\">BBEdit</a> or <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a> for longer pieces.</p>\n<p>Those last two might become the subject of another piece, about how I don’t get what’s so great about BBEdit.  But that’s for another time.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Because with the Tories we’ll only get a disastrously hard crash out.</p>\n<p>Vote to stop the Tories and save the NHS.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>And now, a table of contents.

Labour looked weak. She thought she could get a hugely increased majority for relatively little effort. So despite her repeated promises that should would not, she called a general election.</p>\n<p>Now, however, it might have backfired on her. The polls have shifted (though we know we can’t trust polls). Quite dramatically by some measures. It’s looking like she might end up with a <em>reduced</em> majority. Or even — dare we hope? — a radical change. A Labour majority seems implausible, but a hung parliament? That’s beginning to look a lot like a real possibility.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-fixed-term-parliaments-act\">The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act</h3>\n<p>But what of the act that was supposed to remove prime-ministerial whim from the choice of election date? It turns out it wasn’t worth the paper it was printed on. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011\">Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011</a> contains a clause that allows the current government to call an election if it has the support of the house.</p>\n<p>Not, I note, with a simple majority. Obviously that would be ridiculous for anything really important. No, a two-thirds majority is needed.</p>\n<p>And was easily obtained, owing to the failure of the opposition to oppose; and now May wants to repeal it anyway. But more on both of those later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brexit\">Brexit</h2>\n<p>When the election was called, my <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/04/18/scattered-thoughts-on-the-general-election/\">initial reaction</a> was that it would be all about Brexit. Nothing else loomed so large. And that was why I had concerns about Labour, because Jeremy Corbyn seemed committed to carrying on the madness that the referendum started.</p>\n<p>I wrote then:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n[P]eople will be torn between voting on the normal things they care about: health, security, homes, welfare, the economy… — and the big thing of our time: Brexit.<br>\n…<br>\nI can’t in conscience vote for a Labour party that won’t clearly place itself against Brexit. I just can’t. This means I have to leave the party, I guess. Corbyn called today for “A Brexit that works for all.” No, no, no.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I didn’t leave the party, and though there’s still some truth in that, things have changed. I’m not entirely sure when, or how; but somewhere along the line — the publication of the manifestos was certainly part of it — the normal things began to matter again. They never stopped mattering, of course, but they came back into focus.</p>\n<p>One of the normal things in particular: the NHS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"saving-the-nhs\">Saving the NHS</h2>\n<p>The Tories — modern Tories, at least — have never really supported it. They have always pushed privatisation of it, or as much of it as possible. Though to be fair, the last Labour government at fault there too, with their public-private partnerships.</p>\n<p>Tories, of course, have pushed for privatisation in everything, not just the NHS, at least since Thatcher. But even Thatcher kept her hands off the NHS. Not so this lot. Thatcher didn’t leave much to privatise, so their eyes are firmly on the last great publicly owned body.</p>\n<p>I fear that if May’s lot get back in, especially with an increased majority, we could see the beginning of the end of free universal healthcare in the UK. We are in that much danger.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thoughts-on-corbyn-past-present\">Thoughts on Corbyn, past &amp; present</h2>\n<p>I voted for Corbyn as leader twice. I had my doubts, but he always seemed to be on the right side; and as well, there was no good alternative (not the second time, anyway).</p>\n<h3 id=\"around-the-referendum\">Around the Referendum</h3>\n<p>Then I felt totally let down by Brexit &amp; after. To be fair, his “trigger Article 50 now” comments were slightly misinterpreted, but expressing himself like that just added to the idea that he couldn’t handle himself with the media.</p>\n<p>And that was certainly true in the first several months. It was like he — the party as a whole — had no media management at all.</p>\n<p>And at no time did he resist Brexit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"post-referendum\">Post Referendum</h3>\n<p>Then there was a series of mistakes, or bad decisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The three-line whip on the first Article 50 vote.</li>\n<li>Not resisting the invocation of Article 50 at all, even when criticising it.</li>\n<li>Waving through the vote to have the election. Because even if he didn’t want to stop it, how much better would it have been to make the Tories call a vote of no confidence? If only for the <em>schadenfreude</em>.</li>\n<li>Then he chose not to join the debate because May wasn’t involved? That’s what we call missing an open goal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-big-improvement\">The Big Improvement</h3>\n<p>Things have — and he has — got so much better since then. Somewhere along the line he started to come across as the dignified, statesmanlike man of principle that we knew he was. What changed? Was it better media management, or did the media actually start to give him some proper time?</p>\n<p>I don’t know, but the result is that the polls have turned round dramatically, giving rise to a measure of that most terrifying of things: <em>hope</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"manifesto-destiny\">Manifesto Destiny</h3>\n<p>Everything in the Labour manifesto is better for the country than everything in the Tory one. It’s as simple as that. “For the many, not the few” is the tag line they’ve been using, and it’s great. Simple, to the point, meaningful. And accurate.</p>\n<p>Not to mention costed. No “magic money tree” here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"back-to-brexit\">Back to Brexit</h3>\n<p>Although they haven’t said so, I could see a Labour government offering a second referendum. At least you can imagine them being more open to considering the possibility. Especially, of course, if they were in coalition.</p>\n<p>Now that takes us to the next question: if it’s a hung parliament, can we trust the LibDems not to back the Tories again?</p>\n<p>I mean, surely, this time… But that’s what we thought he last time, and look where that got us. So it’s a worry. But the LibDems are likely to get some of their old seats back, and Labour almost certainly can’t get a majority with the way things have changed in Scotland, so a coalition is our best hope.</p>\n<h2 id=\"may-madness\">May Madness</h2>\n<p>Now let’s turn our attention to our gloryless leader.</p>\n<p>Theresa May has presented an increasingly bizarre face to the world over the last few weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Her “Me, me, me” approach to presenting Tory policy (“If I lose six seats…” you only get one); that’s not how politics in the UK works.</li>\n<li>She wants to reverse the country’s stumbling steps toward better voting systems, such as the proportional system for the London Mayor.</li>\n<li>Politicising the terrorist attacks:\n<ul>\n<li>first troops on the streets, <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/05/27/losing-the-war-on-terror/\">as I discussed</a>;</li>\n<li>and now she wants to tear up human rights legislation. Next it’ll be internment, I shouldn’t wonder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She was seemingly scared to debate the other party leaders on TV. Debates may not be quite standard in British elections yet, but that is the way the world was moving.</li>\n<li>Oh, and along with voting reversals, she wants to <em>repeal</em> the fixed-term parliaments act, for what little use it was.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, it seems like she just wants to go backwards to an imagined Little-England past.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It won’t surprise you in the slightest to hear that I’m strongly advocating voting <em>against</em> the Tories, in whatever way you can have the most effect. I will be voting Labour, of course, but then I live in one of the safest Labour seats in the country, so that doesn’t have a lot of effect.</p>\n<p>However, I’ll also be joining other Labour members from Hackney tomorrow in heading over to Westminster North, which is a Labour marginal. I’ll be helping to get out the vote there.</p>\n<p>To you I say, please vote. Vote to stop the Tory mayhem. Vote to save the NHS.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

And I didn’t realise they were a two-parter.</p>\n<p>Except (spoilers) — oh, they’re not. They’re the first two of an <em>n</em>-parter, where <em>n</em> equals… who knows? At least three, and I’m sort of guessing from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_10)\">titles and directors</a> that it might be four.</p>\n<p>Anyway, in them we have one really good episode, one not so good.</p>\n<p>Episode 6, “Extremis,” was really very good indeed.

It’s one of those ones where a little bit more care, a few easily-insertable words, and it would all have held together much better.

Now they’re becoming alarmingly commonplace. I saw two outside Liverpool Street Station yesterday; armed, like the two above, not just with pistols, but with big, two handed things that most people would call “machine guns.” This increasing militarisation of the police was taken a step further this week when the Maybot ordered actual troops onto the streets. And I read that armoured vehicles were going to be deployed at the FA Cup final.</p>\n<p>Armed police on a beach: why?

Worry and low-grade fear aren’t terror, but they’re on the same axis. Overreacting like this is playing into the terrorists’ hands.

Oddly, they don’t explain why. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/25/bbc-store-closing-november/\">This Engadget article</a> says it’s because “people prefer streaming.”</p>\n<p>At least, that’s what the headline says. The article actually says the decision comes “following poor sales and tough competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Video.”</p>\n<p>Which is plausible enough, I suppose. Though I doubt that most people could explain the difference between a streaming service and one in which you have to download the file first. And in any case, Netflix and I think Amazon also allow you to download now.</p>\n<p>In fact my guess would be more that people prefer subscriptions. Amazon and Netflix are compelling because once your monthly fee is paid you can always watch anything they have. With the Store you had to buy specific titles, and there’s always that hesitation about paying before you watch something.</p>\n<p>I only ever used it to watch a couple of episodes of something I had left too late to see on iPlayer. specifically, one episode of <cite>Undercover</cite>. Apparently I spent £1.89, and I’ll be getting a £2.50 Amazon voucher to make up for it. Whee, an investment.</p>\n<p>So I guess I was part of the poor sales.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there is the opinion of some — and it would be of many in Britain, I imagine — that BBC programmes should just be available. We shouldn’t have to pay for them again. “We’re not just listeners and viewers, it belongs to us,” as a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q2iZuU5WM\">great man once sang</a>.</p>\n<p>Maybe that’s the solution to the arguments over funding: treat the licence fee as a subscription charge. Increase it, make it optional, but include access to the BBC’s entire back catalogue.</p>\n<p>But the Engadget article goes on to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  If the rumours are true, BritBox — <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/07/bbc-itv-britbox-streaming-service-launch/\">the BBC- and ITV-owned streaming service that launched in the US earlier this year</a> — could be expanded to host more of the BBC’s back catalogue and eventually launch in the UK.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>BBC <em>and</em> ITV? Together? Well I never.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Back in Balloch in 1981, 82 or so we use to play a Pac-Man clone called Spout Rolla. But there are no references to it on the internet, as far as I can tell. So this is my story about it.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time a gang of kids — thinking they were adults, but not really — used to go to the pub, and play a game.</p>\n<p>The pub was actually the bar of a place called <a href=\"http://www.duckbay.co.uk\">Duck Bay Marina</a>. I see from that link that they now call it “Duck Bay Hotel.” Either way, it was a couple of miles outside Balloch, on the west bank of Loch Lomond.</p>\n<p>Why did we go there, when there were pubs in the town? Two reasons, I suspect. One, some of us had driving licences and the chance to use our parents’ cars, so why not? (I wasn’t yet one of them at that point.) And two, it had video games in the foyer.</p>\n<p>That had a dual advantage. We could play the games, and those of us who, let’s say, weren’t quite strictly within the parameters of the legal drinking age, could stay out of sight of the staff.</p>\n<p>So: usually two machines, as I recall, plus maybe a fruit machine or two. I first played Frogger there. It was the era when arcade games had started to extend beyond shooting things in space to other tests of skill, like crossing rivers on logs.</p>\n<p>Spout Rolla was in a similar vein. But it was a clear derivative of — let’s be honest, rip-off of — Pac-Man. I’m not sure I’d actually played Pac-Man at that point, but I must have been aware of it.</p>\n<p>The idea was you guided a paint brush moving around a watery maze, painting the maze behind it. Fish would come out and try to catch your brush. If you painted all the maze you got a new screen (which I think might just have been the same maze in different colours, maybe speeded up a bit).</p>\n<p>Instead of the power-pills of Pac-Man, there was one part of the maze that had a paint roller in it. If you approached the roller from the right direction, it went with you and you accelerated just for that section. Then you could turn back and roll over the fish that were following you, for extra points. And that was it.</p>\n<p>Simpler times, simpler pleasures, I guess. It never made much sense, but we liked it.</p>\n<p>Thing is, everything’s on the net today, right? Well, apparently not. When I googled it today, I found two surprising thing. First, that there are no references to “Spout Rolla game” to be found, with or without quotes round the first two words. Second, that <a href=\"https://mapcarta.com/17620080\">Spout Rolla is a place in Scotland</a>, namely a waterfall in Perth and Kinross.<sup id=\"fnref-3345-waterfall\"><a href=\"#fn-3345-waterfall\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Could this possibly be that most unlikely of things (at least before Rockstar Games): a Scottish game?</p>\n<p>My son suggested that there would be people my age trying to remember what the game was called. So I tried googling for a description of it: <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pac-man+clone+fish+paint+roller&amp;t=ipad&amp;ia=videos\">pac-man clone fish paint roller</a>. That search has selected videos, which I didn’t. But I did find a possible explanation.</p>\n<p>It seems there was a game called <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/arcade_crush\">Crush Roller, also known as Make Trax</a>, and the one I remember could be a rebadged version of that. Plus you can play it at that link. As with many games of the time, it’s not as satisfying playing them with arrow keys as it was with a joystick.</p>\n<p>So, no, it’s not Scottish, but it could possibly have been rebadged for the Scottish market. Or maybe just that one in Duck Bay, who knows.</p>\n<p>The only thing is that, seeing that version, I had forgotten about there being <em>two</em> rollers. I was fairly sure there was only one, but playing it felt familiar, so I guess Crush Roller/Make Trax is it.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-3345-waterfall\">\nInitially the only <a href=\"https://sv.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spout_Rolla\">Wikipedia page for it</a> I could find was in Swedish. But latterly (2019-12-08), I find it’s better known as “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sput_Rolla\">Sput Rolla</a>.” According to the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_waterfalls_of_Scotland\">List of waterfalls of Scotland</a>” article, “‘Spout’ is another common word found throughout England and Scotland for particular types of fall though it is usually replaced by ‘sput’ in the formerly Gaelic-speaking parts of the latter.” <a href=\"#fnref-3345-waterfall\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

And at Easter, which still feels like the right time of the year.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/11/28/raven-and-what/\">as you’ll know</a>, I thought last season was the best season of New Who. I may have been being a tad hyperbolic there… but not entirely.</p>\n<p>And now we’ve got “The Pilot,” the first episode of the new season. Introducing <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4929530/\">Pearl Mackie</a> as Bill Potts. Among other things, I’ve got to say that this would be a great jumping-on point; a fine episode for someone new to the series to start.</p>\n<p>The story was good, not great; there were unnecessary Daleks, but if that means they’re going to otherwise be given a rest for this season, I won’t complain; and we’ve got the mysterious vault that The Doctor and Nardole are investigating. I suspect it might be most of the season before we find out what’s going on with that.</p>\n<p>Nice references to the past with the pictures of River and Susan; and the people who were fighting the Daleks were <a href=\"tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Dalek-Movellan_War\">Movellans</a>, apparently. I learned this on Jason Snell’s <a href=\"https://www.theincomparable.com/teevee/doctorwho/\">Doctor Who Flashcast</a> podcast. I knew I recognised them, so I thought they must be <a href=\"http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Thal\">Thals</a>, and that we were right back at the start of it all. It’s a very long time since I saw either.</p>\n<p>So, The Doctor has been lecturing at Bristol University for maybe fifty years? Intriguing. And the mini-trailer that we got as well as the usual “Next time…” is even more so. Both Missy and John Simm (presumably as The Master). The start of The Doctor’s regeneration sequence. We know he’s going to regenerate, but not, presumably till the last episode.</p>\n<p>Though on that point, Capaldi said on <cite>The Graham Norton Show</cite> that he had already filmed his part of the regeneration scene, and the only thing they still had to film was the Christmas special. Not surprisingly he wouldn’t give an explanation of that paradox.</p>\n<p>I have a theory, or suggestion for how things might develop. They won’t do this, and they shouldn’t; but bear with me.</p>\n<p>In a reversal of the now-common trope of The Doctor’s companion falling for him, The Doctor falls for Bill. She, of course, is not interested. So The Doctor regenerates into a female form.</p>\n<p>That would be to put Bill’s sexuality too much to the fore, and of course be wildly unlike The Doctor. But it amused me to consider for a few minutes.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

That implies a path laid out for us, an unshakeable future that is planned and unchangeable. And it is entitled.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That is a perfectly normal use of the modern sense of the word “entitled,” and it still slightly bothers me, as it has lo! these several years.</p>\n<p>Because what it really means is that the person isn’t actually entitled to the thing in question. The older sense of “entitle” is to have the right to something — literally to have the <em>title</em>.</p>\n<p>The modern meaning — the “He’s so entitled” formulation — really means “He’s behaving as if he were entitled to…”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/entitle\">Dictionary.com gives the definition of <em>entitle</em></a> as:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  to give (a person or thing) a title, right, or claim to something; furnish with grounds for laying claim\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Merriam-Webster is similar;</p>\n<blockquote>\n  1:  to give a title to :  designate<br>\n  2:  to furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming something this ticket entitles the bearer to free admission\n</blockquote>\n<p>And neither has the modern meaning at all.</p>\n<p>But I’m slightly horrified to find that the built-in dictionary in MacOS <em>only</em> has the modern meaning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  adjective<br>\n  believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment: kids who feel so entitled and think the world will revolve around them\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s interesting, though, that its definition of <em>entitle</em> is similar to the two web-based ones. And <a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/entitled\">Cambridge</a> has <a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/entitle\">both</a>. It seems the difference is whether you use the verb or the adjective. The latter is the only one with the modern meaning.</p>\n<p>Language changes, and that’s fine. But I wish that people who use it in the modern fashion understood what it is they’re saying, and what it can sound like they’re saying.

In spaaaaaace. But he has a shameful secret that should be neither in highly advanced future society. On the other hand, a highly advanced future society shouldn’t have a nobility. I guess societies can go back as well as forward.</p>\n<h2>“Taking Flight,” by Una McCormack</h2>\n<p>Another rich person mooches around with no real aim in life, this time in a society that has genetically engineered slaves.</p>\n<h2>“Presence,” by Helen Oyeyemi</h2>\n<p>This is the most disjointed, disconnected of the stories. A heterosexual married couple avoid communicating with each other because she’s convinced he’s about to leave her. Until they do, and it turns out instead that he wants to postpone their holiday so they can try out some sort of therapy for grieving people that he has developed. They do, and things get strange. There’s potential here, but all the initial setup about them not communicating is just ignored after they get to the point, so it could have mostly been left out. It really feels like it wants to be two or more different stories.</p>\n<h2>“The Apologists,” by Tade Thompson</h2>\n<p>A super-advanced alien race have accidentally killed all by five people of the human race. The five are put to work helping the aliens reconstruct a simulacrum of Earth, while a daily apology is blasted at them out of a sound system (hence the title). They seem surprisingly untraumatised by this situation.</p>\n<h2>“The Arrival of Missives” (Extract), by Aliya Whiteley</h2>\n<p>Not sure why this is an extract. Probably the original work is too long to fit in the booklet. A during the First World War a sixteen-year-old girl is in love with her teacher. She decides she has to let him know. The extract ends just when something out of the ordinary is revealed.</p>\n<h2>Thoughts and Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Well, I haven’t made them sound very good, have I? I did actually enjoy reading them all, but reduced to capsule summaries, they aren’t going to win any awards. Oh, wait…</p>\n<p>I’ve no idea which one I’ll vote for.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

She dangled there all night, and in the morning, when they came to cut the body down, she was still alive.’ Webster became known as Half-Hanged Mary.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>But I can’t help thinking, if there’s anything to the story, wouldn’t they have taken her survival as <em>further evidence</em> of her witchy nature, and made sure they killed her next time? As it is, it sounds like she lived on.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

At some point in the evening I realised I wasn’t going to write a post, so I just said, “Fine: that’s allowed.”</p>\n<p>Today I started by going for a swim. After my <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/21/recent-events/\">new regime of exercise last summer</a>, I got out of the habit once I <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/02/recent-events-2/\">started a new contract</a>. So it was good to get back to it. (Which is not to say I haven’t swum or gone to the gym in all that time, but it’s been a few weeks at the moment.)</p>\n<p>After that I took a <a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com\">HackerRank test</a> for a new job opportunity. It’s a site that does programming tests. This one was, I suspect, a disaster. I hate doing that kind of thing: you’ve got a timer running, and the problem you’re trying to solve is unlike anything you’d have to do professionally… Anyway, suffice to say, it didn’t go terribly well.</p>\n<p>This evening was all about falling asleep in front of the telly. We tried to watch <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2920540/?ref_=nv_sr_1\"><cite>20,000 Days On Earth</cite></a>, the film about Nick Cave from a few years back. I got it a few Christmases or birthdays ago, but hadn’t got round to watching it till now. I enjoyed what I saw of it, but there was definite falling asleep on the sofa and missing chunks. Oh well, it’s a DVD: we can always go back.</p>\n<p>Oh yes: there was also a trip to Westfield, the time-void where hours go to die.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Yesterday a member posted a link to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39444025?SThisFB\">BBC story about the sexuality</a> of the new companion in <cite>Doctor Who</cite>. “Doctor Who gets first openly gay companion,” it says. Nice to know, but no big deal in 2017, right?</p>\n<p>Wrong, sadly. I woke to 81 comments on the FB post. That’s a huge number by the normal standards of the group. It’s not very chatty. It turned out that a raving homophobe had stormed into the group and started to shout about the corruption of youth and I don’t know what all. The comments were a combination of his, and of calmer and more tolerant heads both calling him out and trying to debate rationally with him. To no avail.</p>\n<p>I had no choice — nor any desire — but to kick him out the group and block him. I wrote <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/BritishScienceFictionAssociation/permalink/10154445193132045/\">the following</a>, and I thought I should preserve it here;</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I’ve just had to eject a member from the group for making offensive remarks to other members. And worse, making remarks offensive to other members.</p>\n<p>  Specifically he was being offensive to all our LGBT members, and everyone who supports them, or who just supports humanity and common decency.<br>\n  Oh, wait, that’s <strong>all</strong> the other members, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>  Folks, I don’t need to tell you this, but it’s 2017. You can no longer argue that characters in popular TV programmes should not reflect the whole range of people in society. Nor can you make the argument that a character’s sexuality should have no place in <cite>Doctor Who</cite>, when it plainly has had a place at least since 2005.</p>\n<p>  Or don’t these people remember Rose being in love with The Doctor? Martha pining over him? Hell, go back further: Jo went off and married a male ecologist. And I’m sure at least a couple of other female companions went off with guys.</p>\n<p>  <strong>Flaunting</strong> their heterosexuality.</p>\n<p>  We won’t get any of that with Bill, at least.</p>\n<p>  Unless the next Doctor is a woman.\n</p></blockquote>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Borrowing that title from (what used to be) a regular section in Dave Langford’s <cite><a href=\"http://news.ansible.uk\">Ansible</a></cite> newsletter.</p>\n<p>The publishing sin in question, though, is quite astonishingly egregious, if the story is true. And I have no reason to doubt it.</p>\n<p>There’s a book called <cite><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/too-like-the-lightning-ada-palmer/1122537906?ean=9780765378002\">Too Like the Lightning</a></cite>, by Ada Palmer. I read a review of it a year or so back and thought it sounded really interesting. But I didn’t get round to trying to get it at the time.</p>\n<p>Something reminded me of it recently, and I tracked it down, at least to the publisher’s site that I linked to there. But I wanted to buy a copy on Kindle, and Amazon had no sign of it. This is relatively rare nowadays. Especially in SF, surely.</p>\n<p>I tried again a couple of times, but to no avail. There are a few chapters available on the Tor website; and they were one of the first major publishers to really push ebooks without DRM, so you’d expect something there, but no.</p>\n<p>I think you can get a Nook copy at the site above, but Nook? I mean, come on.</p>\n<p>Anyway, eventually I duckducked in the modern style, which is to say I just typed the question: “why is ‘too like the lightning’ not available on kindle”.</p>\n<p>I was led to a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5wwmo9/ada_palmer_ama_author_of_too_like_the_lightning/?st=j0pneb2r&amp;sh=d911c934\">Reddit AMA with the author</a>, wherein she said this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  That [making the book available on the UK Kindle store] can only happen if a UK publisher decides to publish it. Unfortunately <strong>UK publishers rarely publish female SF authors; a lot of them feel strongly that only male SF authors are likely to sell</strong>. If you want it to come out in the UK Kindle store, the best option is to write a quick e-mail to a couple of your favorite UK SP publishers to tell them you’re eager for these books — hearing from readers makes a big difference when publishers are considering picking up an author for localization.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Emphasis mine. If this is true — and again, I have no reason to doubt her word — I am beyond horrified that such an attitude can be prevalent at UK publishers. In 2017.</p>\n<p>Obviously what I want to do now is to buy a physical copy, here in the UK. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Lightning-Terra-Ignota-Assistant-Professor-History-Palmer/0765378019/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490566148&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=too+like+the+lightning\">It’s listed on Amazon UK</a>, but it’s not clear whether it’s an import from the US, or what. (Also very strange is the author’s credit in that entry: “Assistant Professor of History Ada Palmer.” It even makes it into the URL.)</p>\n<p>As well as blatant sexism, this is an example of the ridiculous regionalism that publishers still try to force onto the internet age. Also film and TV companies. Luckily Apple stopped the music business doing that.</p>\n<p>Bits don’t see borders. And neither should we. But that’s very much another conversation.</p>\n<p>Actually, you know what I’m going to do? I’m going to see if I can order it from <a href=\"http://pagesofhackney.co.uk\">my local bookshop</a>. Support your local, as well as fight sexism in a small way.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Today’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/22/how-the-new-electronics-ban-serves-the-trump-agenda/?utm_term=.0ee6e06efb73\">Washington Post WorldView</a> newsletter throws more light, a lot of shade, and a lot more confusion onto the <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/21/stupid-fawning-lapdog-government-apes-the-us-again/\">ban I linked to last night</a>, on taking laptops and tablets in hand luggage from certain airports.</p>\n<p>First, I didn’t realise that the list of affected airports is different between the UK and the US. Second, for the US, it is just a small set of airports, not all airports in the affected countries. The UK takes the broader approach — but for a different set of countries.</p>\n<p>The most interesting point to my mind is that this may all be Trump trying to help American businesses:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/us-unveils-new-restrictions-on-travelers-from-eight-muslim-majority-countries/2017/03/21/d4efd080-0dcb-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html?utm_term=.f8fd93ddc28d\">pressed by reporters</a>, officials in both countries said the measures were not a response to a specific threat, but rather the result of intelligence assessments that concluded groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda are seeking new methods to sow terror in the skies, possibly through hidden bombs in electronic equipment.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>And later:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Farrell and Newman suggested Tuesday’s order is an example of the Trump administration “weaponizing interdependence” — using its leverage in a world where American airports are key “nodes” in global air travel to weaken competitors. My colleague Max Bearak <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/21/what-is-the-logic-behind-trumps-new-electronics-ban-people-are-stumped/?utm_term=.41d88b6c74d5\">detailed how this could be a part of Trump’s wider protectionist agenda</a>. In February, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-08/u-s-airline-chiefs-set-to-talk-jobs-traffic-control-with-trump\">met with executives of U.S. airlines</a> and pledged that he would help them compete against foreign carriers that receive subsidies from their home governments.</p>\n<p>  “A lot of that competition is subsidized by governments, big league,” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/21/what-is-the-logic-behind-trumps-new-electronics-ban-people-are-stumped/?utm_term=.41d88b6c74d5\">said</a> Trump at that meeting. “I’ve heard that complaint from different people in this room. Probably about one hour after I got elected, I was inundated with calls from your industry and many other industries, because it’s a very unfair situation.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So unfair. But if that’s what’s behind it, what the hell does our glorious leader get out of going along with a slightly modified version of it? It’s certainly not to protect British airlines, as they (unlike American airlines) are affected by the ban. Maybe my “lapdog” dig was exactly right. For years Tony Blair was referred too as George W Bush’s poodle. Maybe Theresa May is adopting the same role for Trump. Which is a horrifying thought.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/us-unveils-new-restrictions-on-travelers-from-eight-muslim-majority-countries/2017/03/21/d4efd080-0dcb-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html?utm_term=.0c6ec86f35ee&amp;wpisrc=nl_todayworld&amp;wpmm=1\">Another WaPo article</a> contradicts all that, though, suggesting that the whole thing might be based on some credible concerns:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  The U.S. restrictions were prompted by a growing concern within the government that terrorists who have long sought to develop hard-to-detect bombs hidden inside electronic devices may have put renewed effort into that work, according to people familiar with the matter\n</blockquote>\n<p>But it asks the question and fails to get a satisfactory answer, “Why not ban all electronics on flights, then?”</p>\n<blockquote>\n  People familiar with the discussions said the restrictions were designed to defeat the particular type of threat that is of greatest concern: the possibility that terrorists could smuggle explosives inside electronics and manually detonate them once on a plane.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if that makes sense (after all, its not like a computer in the hold is (or could hide) some kind of timing device): why just from a strange subset of airports, even in the countries of concern?</p>\n<p>And if it’s all based on a real threat, why the US/UK difference?</p>\n<p>They also raise the real concern that journalists, activists, and just ordinary citizens, will be separated from their personal information, leaving it under the control of unknown people.</p>\n<p>Buckle up, folks, this ride is only going to get stranger and more unpleasant.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

But I was just having another go, and I noticed that the version on the website is 1.0 (BETA 6.1), while I had BETA 4. A quick download and we’re up and running: it works!\n\nNow I just have to keep my MacBook running at all times. Oh well.\n\n[^recall]: I know, you probably won’t.\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Couple of thoughts about the news, tonight. First of all, CNN <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/13/politics/sean-spicer-donald-trump-wiretapping/index.html?utm_campaign=digest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=app\">reports</a> on Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s “counselor,” and her strange thoughts about microwaves:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other,” Conway said, before suggesting that surveillance could take place through phones, TVs or “microwaves that turn into cameras.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I want one of these magic microwaves. I mean, think about it: you can reheat your leftovers, then take a photograph of them and post it to Instagram. All from the same device.</p>\n<p>More sanely (at least slightly) they seem to be backing off from the nonsensical wiretapping accusations. According to Sean Spicer, the Whitehouse press secretary:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “The President used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So that’s OK, then.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"edition.cnn.com/2017/03/05/opinions/trump-tweets-fun-over-obeidallah-opinion/index.html?iid=ob_lockedrail_bottomlist\">another article</a> they treat it all more seriously, pointing out that doing down your predecessors is a tactic of dictators everywhere:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n  They, too, use the apparatus of government to support their whims. And worse, they also seek to punish their predecessors in office and political opponents — as we have seen in countries from Iran to Zambia to, of course, Russia.\n</p>\n<p>  How long until we hear Trump surrogates suggest that Obama might be guilty of a crime?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Closer to home, the UK government’s Mayhem programme involved them <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39262081?utm_campaign=digest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=app\">forcing through the Brexit bill</a>, so we’re teetering along the slippery slope, getting ready to run towards the cliff of deadly metaphors.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Corbyn has things in hand, though. He tweeted:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Deeply disappointing that govt denied the people, through Parliament, Brexit oversight &amp; refused to guarantee the rights of EU nationals</p>\n<p>— Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/841389075710017537\">March 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We will continue to demand that the stress they, and Brits in the EU, are being put under is ended, and they are given the right to remain</p>\n<p>— Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/841389122874933248\">March 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Labour at every stage will challenge govt plans for a bargain basement Brexit with our alternative that puts jobs &amp; living standards first</p>\n<p>— Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/841389197005053953\">March 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>This is the same Jeremy Corbyn who, just a few weeks ago, put a three-line whip in place to make his MPs vote in favour of the initial version of the bill — which is identical to the version that has now been passed, since the Lords’ amendments were all rolled back.</p>\n<p>I voted for him as leader, twice, but I regret it now, I’ve got to say. He’s a decent guy, and I agree with him on many — even most — issues. But on this, the most important thing facing our country today, leading to potentially the biggest disaster since the Second World War, he’s been completely useless. Worse: complicit.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Shhh: a secret gig!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Or something very like that. It was on the Friday night at the Mean Fiddler. Which I don’t think I had ever been to at that time, and which was a bastard long way from Tooting. But I wasn’t going to miss the chance to see SLF in a small club.</p>\n<p>What I mainly remember was that the Academy gig the next night was a bit of a letdown after the intensity of seeing them at the Mean Fiddler.</p>\n<p>But anyway, the point of all of this is that as far as I remember things, this all was — or was billed as — their farewell tour. That’s why the t-shirt (which I still have) says “Game Over.”</p>\n<p>Now obviously they’re around again, and I’ve seen them since, and bought albums they’ve released since. But my memory says they broke up in 87 (or it could have been 88, but I think not (though actually March 88 if <a href=\"http://www.setlist.fm/setlists/stiff-little-fingers-7bd6b20c.html?page=32\">this setlist site</a> is to be believed)), and then reformed later. But Wikipedia and <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/stiff-little-fingers-mn0000937098/biography\">All Music</a> both say I’m wrong.</p>\n<p>I don’t know. Who would <em>you</em> trust?</p>\n<p>Actually probably not me. I’m becoming more convinced as I look at that setlist site, that I must have seen them several times at the Academy, after moving to London in 87, and the supposed farewell tour must have been later. In which case the Mean Fiddler was a bastard long way from Walthamstow, but that’s still true.</p>\n<p>The second odd experience was that I clicked onto the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stiff_Little_Fingers\">Wikipedia talk page</a> to see whether the history was disputed at all. It isn’t, but around five sections in there’s a section entitled “the?”, in which someone asks whether they were ever referred to as “the Stiff Little Fingers.”</p>\n<p>And back in 2007 some guy called “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Devilgate\">Devilgate</a>” answered firmly in the negative.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

In fact, having written that, I just have: <a href=\"/categories/language\">language</a> (hopefully that link will work once I publish this).</p>\n<p>Today I want to talk about the word “pivot.” As you know, pivot has come, over the last few years, to mean change direction, especially in a political context. A recent example from the <cite>New Yorker</cite>: <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dont-be-fooled-donald-trump-didnt-pivot\">Don’t Be Fooled. Donald Trump Didn’t Pivot</a>.</p>\n<p>It sort of makes sense, but like many knew usages, I can’t help but wonder <em>why</em> it has come into this use.</p>\n<p>And for this one I also can’t help but wonder to what extent <cite>Friends</cite> is responsible.</p>\n<p>You’ll know the episode I’m thinking of, if you’ve seen it: Ross is moving in to a new apartment, and being too cheap to pay the delivery charge, ropes Rachel in to help him move a sofa. Inevitably they get stuck on the stairs, and he keeps shouting at her, “Pivot! Pivot!” to try to get her to turn the sofa in an unspecified direction.</p>\n<p>Of course, he might have been using it quite precisely: the sofa probably needed to rotate about a fixed point, which is what “pivot” originally meant.</p>\n<p>What it has come to mean, in politics, is a change of direction less than a U-turn (or flip-flop); but still quite a substantial one. I suppose it has a sense of turning without moving forward at the same time. Though I may be overthinking it there. It’s quite descriptive, but it seems like it has becoming ubiquitous incredibly quickly; and is already practically a cliche.</p>\n<p>Of course that’s just my view of the <a href=\"/blog/2017/02/08/optics/\">optics</a> of the thing.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Though I notice the article is two years old. It just came to my attention via <strike>Facebook</strike> one of Twitter’s occasional emails.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  David Tredinnick said astrology, along with complementary medicine, could take pressure off NHS doctors, but acknowledged that any attempt to spend taxpayers’ money on consulting the stars would cause “a huge row”.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Getting his defence in early, he goes on to say that his likely critics (he names Brian Cox specifically):</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “… are also ignorant, because they never study the subject and just say that it is all to do with what appears in the newspapers, which it is not, and they are deeply prejudiced, and racially prejudiced, which is troubling.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nice tactic: he knows he’s talking bullshit, so accuses people of racism. Last time I checked, astrology wasn’t a race.</p>\n<p>Nor was stupidity.</p>\n<p>And in the unlikely event that anyone reading this thinks I’m just being reflexively mean and as bad as the critics he fears, here’s a considered scientific opinion. The only possible known way the positions of the planets and stars at our birth could affect us is by gravity. And while gravity does travel all through the universe, it is very, very weak — the weakest of the fundamental forces. Just look at how hard it was to measure gravitational waves. We were only able to do that in the last year, and it took colliding black holes to make enough of a splash for us to measure.</p>\n<p>Is it possible that heavenly bodies affect us in some other, as yet unknown way? Yes. And here’s what science says about that: show us how, and we’ll study it. Demonstrate the mechanism by which this influence happens, and we’ll write down the equations that govern it and learn all about it. We’ll have to throw out all existing models of physics, but if you bring the evidence, that’s what we’ll do.</p>\n<p>That’s science.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>More trouble with the home network today. We had a smart electricity meter installed a few days ago. Though without the “smart” part, because they couldn’t get a good enough signal down in our basement. You’d think they’d have considered that possibility in designing them, since that’s the kind of place where a lot of people’s meters are. Anyway, I think it was interfering with our powerline connection.</p>\n<p>We have a BT HomeHub as our main router and connection out to the fibre. But the wifi was a bit crap up at the top of house. So about a year back I got a couple of powerline connectors and used them to extend the 5GHz network upstairs, using another router that we had accidentally acquired as the other access point.</p>\n<p>It worked fine, until just the other day. The first symptom was that the Sonos app couldn’t connect to the speaker. I did some diagnosis, and everything was just weird. We could mostly connect to the outside world without any trouble, but I couldn’t connect to the HomeHub’s web interface by name. Nor, I think, by IP address. And then in one of my experiments I tried a slightly different IP address (one that shouldn’t have existed on our network), and I found myself at… a Sky box.</p>\n<p>Now you know my dislike for that bunch. There’s no way I’d let their networking hardware on my LAN, any more than I’d subscribe to their channels. and in any case, just, what?</p>\n<p>I wondered if our network could somehow have got crossed with one of the neighbours’. But it seemed so improbable. The neighbouring network would need to be using the same <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-service-set-identifier-816547\">SSID</a>, at the very least.</p>\n<p>As you’d imagine, I started taking components out to try to isolate the problem. With just the BT HomeHub in place, things were back to normal. But as soon as I began adding parts, everything went weird.</p>\n<p>Eventually I concluded — guessed, really — that the smart meter might be using powerline itself. We’re supposed to get a screen-based device for monitoring usage, and maybe that communicates with the meter over powerline. And the meter could have an embedded sky router? That seems unlikely, but maybe Sky have the contract to do the phoning home for EDF.</p>\n<p>Anyway, since the root of the problem seemed to be at least partly to do with IP address conflicts, I decided to factory-reset everything and rebuild with a different IP address range (I’ve never used <code>172.16.0.0</code> before). Along with a new wifi SSID and password.</p>\n<p>And so far so good. But I’m having trouble getting the second router to route properly via the first, so upstairs is going to be problematic till I can solve that.</p>\n<p>All this is doing, of course, is making me wish that we could get <a href=\"https://eero.com\">Eeros</a> in the UK. A self-configuring mesh network is exactly what we need, and not all this jerry-rigged nonsense.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It must know what it actually is.<br>\n  [...]<br>\n  only the court to which we all subscribe can give an answer: the European Court in Luxembourg.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>He/she (I’m guessing “he,” from the writing style) says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  But a case which—along with Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley, Steven Agnew, a Green member of the Northern Irish Assembly and Keith Taylor, a Green MEP—I am bringing in the Dublin High Court seeks to give us the power to travel back if we need it.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>And he explains that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  We access it via a national court. And it can’t be one of ours. One of the complaints in the Dublin case is that the other 27 have breached the Treaty by excluding us from Council meetings before we’ve notified under Article 50. And that complaint can only be made by a court in one of those 27. The Irish court is the natural choice\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which all seems fair. The idea seems to be that the European Court of Justice could rule definitively that we could revoke our triggering of Article 50 at the end of the two-year negotiating period. And if the deal is bad, or especially if there isn’t one, parliament is likely to call another referendum in those circumstances, wherein we’ll know exactly what we’re voting for, and get it right this time.</p>\n<p>A small hope, like I say. And it doesn’t protect us from the damage that’s being inflicted in the meantime.</p>\n<p>But a small hope is better than none at all.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

At which time I was going to be traveling to King’s Cross to get a train to Edinburgh, which is a wee bit inconvenient.</p>\n<p>As it happened by just after ten I was <em>at</em> KX, and buying my lunch for the journey. But of course at that time I had forgotten about the tickets. By the time I remembered it was 12:44. The Palladium only holds just over 2000, so there wasn’t much hope.</p>\n<p>But I wasn’t helped by Ticketmaster’s ludicrous captcha overkill. Seemed like every time I moved from one page to another I had to click an “I am not a robot” checkbox and then select all the pictures containing street signs, or pickup trucks, or storefronts, from an array of tiny shitty pictures. Pickup trucks and storefronts? We barely have the former in this country, and we don’t use the latter term. And sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s in the pictures. I was doing this on a phone, after all.</p>\n<p>I wonder how serious their problem with automated ticket-buying bots is. I guess it must be an issue, given that the whole business of an inflated resale markets and touts at venues still exists.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all gone in London, but you may have a chance elsewhere.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I’m far from alone in that attitude, of course. But this means, most notably, that I would never get Sky TV. That has only ever mildly bothered me on the odd occasion when they’re showing a film I’d like to see that isn’t available elsewhere.</p>\n<p>But things have taken a turn for the worse lately, and it’s largely the fault of an American TV company that I generally heartily approve of: HBO.</p>\n<p>Actually the rot probably started to set in when Sky got the rights for <cite>Mad Men</cite> Season 5, after the first four had been on BBC 2. I’ve still never got round to seeing the later seasons.</p>\n<p>But the problem with HBO shows is that Sky has the exclusive UK right for something like five years. And that means I haven’t been able to see <cite>Westworld</cite>. Which is a shame, because everyone was talking about it a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>More worryingly by a long way for me, though, is that the new series of <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, which is not being made by HBO, but something called Showtime.

I wouldn’t be surprised if it didn’t, though.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, in doing some research when writing this, I discovered that <cite>Westworld</cite> is available to download via iTunes, so maybe the same will be true for <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>.</p>\n<p>Either way, it’s going to cost.

I didn’t go to see them back then, so last night I put that right. I had never even heard of this place before, but apparently <a href=\"http://www.229thevenue.com/about-229/\">it’s been around since the sixties</a>.

Check them out if you can.</p>\n<p>And then we had the support band that I knew about in advance: Spizz Energi, who are a similar vintage to The Rezillos, and with similar SF-related sensibilities — at least as far as a couple of songs go. But on the night — and after the Tuts — they were actually quite dull.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4966.png\" alt=\"Spizz Energi at 229\" title=\"Still not the Rezillos.\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></p>\n<p>But the Rezillos killed it. They were utterly fantastic. Eugene was playing guitar for the first song or two, which surprised me, but he soon put that away and just sang, along with Fay, of course.</p>\n<p>My only slight regrets were that we didn’t get “Thunderbirds Are Go” or “Teenbeat.” But all the other top hits were there.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4972.png\" alt=\"IMG 4972\" title=\"Finally, the Rezillos.\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></p>\n<p>I realised as I was there that I only ever Instagram from gigs these days.

Disappointingly she was trotting out the line that, irrespective of what they believe, MPs are now tied down by the “democratic will of the people.”\n\nThat is utter nonsense.\n\n## Did the Referendum Give a Democratic Mandate?\n\nThe referendum, as <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/06/25/sixty-three-percent/\">I have said before</a>, did not provide a sufficient majority to change the country’s constitution. In fact, it did not provide a majority at all: thirty-seven percent of the electorate voted to leave. That is under <em>no</em> circumstances a democratic mandate.\n\n## Do MPs Have to Abide by the Referendum’s Result?\n\nThe referendum was advisory, not binding. That was very clear in the act of parliament that enabled it, though it wasn’t mentioned at all in the discussions running up to the event itself. The MPs were asleep at the wheel when the bill went through parliament: if they had given it the thought it deserved, they would have made its advisory nature explicit in the wording of the question; and more importantly, they would have set a proper threshold for it to take effect. A two-thirds majority is common in cases like this.[^inattentive]\n\nMPs make up the house of commons, half of parliament, the sovereign body in the UK. Their role is to scrutinise legislation and to vote on it in accordance with what they understand to be the best interests of the country.\n\nNo-one can say that Brexit would be in the best interests of the country. (Well, OK, they can say it; but they are demonstrably wrong.) MPs not only <em>can</em> vote against the triggering of Article 50: doing so is their <em>duty</em>.\n\n## Why Have Most MPs Switched to Being in Favour of Brexit?\n\nOr at least that’s the way it seems.\n\nI honestly don’t know. I  have my theory, though. They are running scared of the tabloid newspapers. And maybe, as one of my friends suggested on Facebook the other day, literally scared for their lives if they were to resist the Brexit onslaught. Remembering the tragedy of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36555996\">Jo Cox</a>, of course.\n\nIf the latter is really why they are doing it, then the terrorists have won. And even if it’s only fear of the tabloids, then the tabloid terrorists have won. If I were inclined that way I would call the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> and <cite>Sun</cite> traitors to their country for trying to ruin the British economy and damage British society, by forcing us out of the EU and assaulting the European Convention on Human Rights (which, if it needs to be said again and again, was written by Britons and is nothing to do with the EU).\n\n## What’s to be done?\n\nBuggered if I know. If our democratically elected representatives won’t do what they’re elected for and act in the best interests of the country, then I can only conclude that we’re fucked.\n\n[^inattentive]: And to be fair, we, the public, and the media, were equally inattentive to what the bill actually said.\n",

But yes, you read that right: I interrupted reading a Banksie. Now even though it’s a reread, that’s not something that happens normally.</p>\n<p>But then this is not a normal Banksie. My memory of it was that although I hadn’t loved it, it was good enough. But all I remembered from it was two scenes, and the overall background.</p>\n<p>I’ve got to say now, I’m afraid, that it’s down there with <cite>Canal Dreams</cite> as my least favourite. In fact when I reread <cite>Canal Dreams</cite> at some point in the past, I found it was better than I had remembered. This, though: this was worse than I remembered.</p>\n<p>I mean, it’s not <em>terrible</em>. If it were written by someone else, it would probably be fine. But no more than that, I’d imagine: no more than <em>fine</em>.</p>\n<p>What’s wrong with it? Well, it’s just not compelling in the way I expect Banks’s books to be. There are no  characters to speak of, except for the narrator, who is not especially endearing. That shouldn’t matter, but he’s not particularly anything else, either. His attitude to the war-torn environment in which he finds himself is essentially that it is inconveniencing him (and, to be fair, depriving him of his ancestral home).</p>\n<p>But the guy owns a castle. I mean, how sympathetic is he going to be?</p>\n<p>I don’t know, I think the main problem is just that it’s so bloody <em>bleak</em>. I was convinced that it must have been written while he was getting divorced, or otherwise going through a dark period in his life, but <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Banks\">the Wikipedia article</a> doesn’t suggest anything of the sort.</p>\n<p>Anyway, there we go. Another reread. But not one that I can imagine coming back to again. And there are plenty others still to come.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

As a Labour Party member, and one who voted for Jeremy Corbyn as leader twice, I’m very disappointed by the recent reports that he is planning to require MPs to vote in favour of triggering Article 50.</p>\n<p>I know it would be unpopular with certain tabloid papers if parliament were to prevent Brexit. But in truth I think it would be popular in the country. It seems highly likely to me that if there were a second referendum now, the majority would vote in favour of staying in the EU.</p>\n<p>That may be wishful thinking, but I don’t believe so: people have both realised they were lied to, and seen something of what Brexit will mean to the economy, to jobs, and to British society.</p>\n<p>And in any case, parliament is sovereign, and the majority in the referendum was far too small to justify what is, in effect, a constitutional change. Surely an MP’s duty is to vote in the way that is best for the country, and it is clear that leaving the EU would not be in the UK’s best interests.</p>\n<p>I urge you to resist the tyranny of the right-wing press, and go with the majority of Hackney North and Stoke Newington voters, and please: vote against triggering Article 50.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>Martin McCallion</p></blockquote>\n<p>That ought to do it, eh?</p>\n</body></html>\n",

He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president.<br>\n  …<br>\n  He has poisoned our water forever. Nixon will be remembered as a classic case of a smart man shitting in his own nest. But he also shit in our nests, and that was the crime that history will burn on his memory like a brand. By disgracing and degrading the Presidency of the United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>They were a crooked bunch, though, the Republicans back then. This on Spiro Agnew:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  He was a flat-out, knee-crawling thug with the morals of a weasel on speed. But he was Nixon’s vice president for five years, and he only resigned when he was caught red-handed taking cash bribes across his desk in the White House.\n</p></blockquote>\n\nWhich is not exactly accurate according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon\">Wikipedia article</a>, but it’s not too far off.\n\nThe quote Gruber draws our attention to is this:\n<blockquote>\n  Some people will say that words like scum and rotten are wrong for Objective Journalism — which is true, but they miss the point. It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place. He looked so good on paper that you could almost vote for him sight unseen. He seemed so all-American, so much like Horatio Alger, that he was able to slip through the cracks of Objective Journalism. You had to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly, and the shock of recognition was often painful.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhich reminds me of something I’ve been thinking about for a long time. Which is that I don’t think I <em>want</em> journalism to be objective. At least not in the area of political commentary. News is different, of course. But to me the best journalistic writing comes about when the writer’s personality comes through. When their unique voice can be heard in every paragraph. HST was of course the exemplar of that, but you don’t have to be as extreme as him to write things that have some heart and soul about them, that do more than just recite the facts.\n\nIndeed, that journalistic objectivity is part of the problem.

As well as the many integrations and efficient handling of archiving and deleting emails, I like it because it is one of the only apps that lets you order mail in the One True Way.</p>\n<p>Which in case you’re wondering is oldest at the top. Newest at the top is fine for blogs and similar news-based things, but it’s not right for anything else. Call me old-fashioned, but that was the default in Eudora and probably in Mutt and Elm and all those too, and it was and remains the best way.</p>\n<p>Even Outlook lets you order it oldest-first. Though disturbingly few people take advantage of it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that’s not the point. The point is that today Dispatch let me down. I was typing a reply on my iPad this morning. The reply composition window looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_5a7.jpeg\" alt=\"Fullsizeoutput 5a7\" title=\"fullsizeoutput_5a7.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:20px\"></p>\n<p>I did <em>something</em> — I’m not sure what — that made the composition window slide off to the right. Part of it was still visible, so I tried tapping on it. And it disappeared.</p>\n<p>There was no prompt, and nothing in my drafts folder. All that I had typed was gone, like tears in rain.</p>\n<p>I’ve just been trying to reproduce it, and I can, up to a point: if you slide the compose window to the right it goes off out of the way, like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_5ab.jpeg\" alt=\"Fullsizeoutput 5ab\" title=\"fullsizeoutput_5ab.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:20px\"></p>\n<p>Which is actually quite useful, because it makes the compose window non-modal and lets you interact with your other messages. But somehow something can go wrong, even though I can’t make it happen now.</p>\n<p>Not the end of the world. I retyped the mail. But that’s not good enough, Dispatch.

I’m not sure about the title, but it’s a good piece, by Paul Mason (in fact, looking at the URL I suspect that wasn’t the original title).</p>\n<p>He starts by talking about <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com\">SoundCloud</a>, which is, for me at least, one of those sites that you would never think of going to; you just follow a link to something on it. Mind you, increasingly many sites are like that, and have been since perhaps the early days of blogging. Anyway, Mason says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The Berlin-based music service started as a super-cool platform for people who made music and wanted to share it. Last week, its owners admitted it was losing a million dollars a week, and could run out of cash before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>  …</p>\n<p>  The whole future of the little orange cloud now rests on whether it can get people to subscribe – for money.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which is interesting, and it’s one of those things that the net is a better place for it existing, and I’d be sad to see go away — but I can’t imagine ever subscribing to it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In the same week, another achingly cool online publisher, this time of blogs, Medium, also hit trouble.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>“Achingly cool”? Medium? I’m not convinced (disclaimer: for what it’s worth, my posts are automatically crossposted to Medium, among other places).</p>\n<p>He goes on to talk about how none of the social media sites is profitable, except of course for Facebook. He refers to</p>\n<blockquote>\n  the ailing internet platforms – not just Soundcloud and Medium but Ello, a wannabe rival to Facebook, and Tumblr\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tumblr is ailing? that seems surprising, considering how popular it is. But who knows (it’s also one of the other places I mentioned above). He goes on to exhort us to return to these sites, dust off our old user IDs and so on, and enjoy them again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  It will feel a bit like time travel – back to the period around 2010-12, when social media was associated with postmodernity, self-produced music and revolt, not fake news, white supremacy and rule by old men. But usage alone will not save the collaborative tools. We need new, cooperative ownership models. If basic word processors are effectively now shipped free with every device, so too could be a nonprofit music-sharing service, a free blogging platform and a place to keep in contact with our friends, without intrusive data-farming and a deluge of ads.\n</blockquote>\n<p>As to that, a free blogging platform — while not “shipped”, is easily available: <a href=\"https://wordpress.com\">Wordpress</a>. And there are others, of course. But it links back to what I was <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/07/independent-microblogging/\">saying the other day</a>: you’ve got to own your own content if you want it to be safe from services disappearing.</p>\n<p>As to that “railways” reference in the title, here’s how he finishes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  Medium, Soundcloud and ultimately Twitter are – like the railways – worth saving even if they cannot be run at a profit. 2017 can and should be a year in which the users of platforms reclaim these freedoms not as privileges but as rights.\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve got a lot of time for that view, actually, but those sites are mostly set up on a capitalist model (even if they have a community spirit), and I can’t see that changing any time soon.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I’ve <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/25/self-hosting/\">posted briefly about this before</a> (though that was Google, rather than Twitter). Sure, Twitter isn’t likely to go bust and delete everyone’s tweets without any warning.

So all you should have to do is type (Debian-based example):</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install PACKAGE-NAME\n</code></pre>\n<p>and away you go. Right?</p>\n<p>Well, usually. But today, not for me.</p>\n<p>I have a NAS box from Western Digital, which is really a little Linux server with a biggish disk drive. Some time ago I replaced the shipped distro with a newer one, but it was so long ago, and it’s been so quiet and reliable that I can’t remember what version, exactly.</p>\n<p>So first, there seems to be no way to interrogate it to see what distro it is. I mean, there <em>must</em> be, and <a href=\"https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/find-linux-distribution-name-version-number/\">this page</a> lists several ways, but none of them work on this box. I mean, <code>uname</code> shows me the kernel version and all that, but not the distro.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all that doesn’t really matter. I was only doing it to install <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node</a>, and I was only wanting to install Node so that I could run <a href=\"https://github.com/stephen/airsonos\">AirSonos</a>. We got a <a href=\"http://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/play1.html\">Sonos Play:1</a> for the kitchen recently, and it’s great, but the one weakness is that it doesn’t support playing from an arbitrary source one your phone, such as, say, your podcast app of choice (<a href=\"https://overcast.fm\">Overcast</a>, obvs).</p>\n<p>AirSonos is supposed to effectively turn the Sonos into an AirPlay speaker, so you can easily send audio to it from iOS devices. And you want it to be running on a server, so it’s available all the time.</p>\n<p>But it turns out that Node does not want to install on my NAS. Either by <code>apt-get</code>, as above, or by downloading the binary and unpacking it. (That installs it, obviously, but it won’t run.)</p>\n<p>I’m going to try running <a href=\"http://sonoair.mihosoft.eu\">SonoAir</a> on my MacBook. That’s a wrapper round AirSonos, and obviously it’ll only work (assuming it does at all) when my MacBook is awake. But life’s too short.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

This book is presented as a mysterious dossier which has been given to an FBI agent to analyse. It consists of a series of extracts from government and newspaper reports, and comments by someone who signs themselves “The Archivist.” These are further annotated by the FBI agent.</p>\n<p>The subject matter is mysteries: the many UFO reports, going back to Roswell and before; the mysterious goings on around Twin Peaks itself; stories of the Illuminati and the masons, and so on. Some of the quoted reports are, I assume, real. Many are part of the <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> universe.

Celebrity deaths? 2016 is well behind us — though regarding Trump and Brexit, the worst is still ahead.</p>\n<p>But anyway, I haven’t said anything about my <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/05/18/relaunch/\">work status</a> since <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/21/recent-events/\">back in the summer</a>. So I should bring things up to date.</p>\n<p>I had a few interviews, but no serious interest. Then July was ending, and I was beginning to think that soon we’d be going on holiday, and once we got back it would be nearly September. That was longer than I fancied going without having something lined up.</p>\n<p>And then I got a call from a recruiter telling me there was a bank in the City looking for someone with my exact skill set for a six-month contract. It was supporting — and to some extent building on — the products that I used to make at Misys. That wasn’t quite what I had seen myself doing. I was looking for something that was more of a change, more of a challenge.</p>\n<p>But I went in to talk to them and it all sounded pretty good. A significant number of the people who work there are ex-Misys, and I know them, so it would make for a relatively smooth transition.</p>\n<p>But a contract. I hadn’t really intended to go down that route. Still, the idea of being a freelancer appealed. I’d like to have a go at indie development one of these days, and the two can be complementary. We’ll see where that goes. But I decided to go for it. Set up the limited company (more on that in a later post), discussed the contract (including while I was on holiday) and started at the end of August.</p>\n<p>And it’s… OK. The people are good, the location is great. But the work is not that interesting, and the internal politics are… interesting.</p>\n<p>And there’s the pressure of knowing that you’re dealing (sometimes) with a live system. With real people’s actual money. Having only worked for a software company before, that feels unexpectedly high-pressure.</p>\n<p>All things considered, when my contract is up for renewal at the end of February, I don’t think I’ll be renewing it (even assuming they offer it to me, which they probably will). So I’ll be looking for another position shortly. Maybe contract, maybe permanent again. It depends what comes up.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I thought it was now long gone, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BookshopGlasgow\">apparently not</a>. I was there, probably with my Mum — no, undoubtedly, as I didn’t go to Glasgow on my own till I was about sixteen — I’m guessing in about January, to spend Christmas money (often given in the form of <a href=\"http://www.nationalbooktokens.com\">Book Tokens</a> in those days, of course).</p>\n<p>I bought a stack of books. I don’t now recall what any of them were, but they were almost certainly mostly or entirely SF.</p>\n<p>As was the freebie that I got by accident. If memory serves I paid at the checkout and gathered up my books, or more likely the assistant put them in a bag for me, and then when I got on to the train back to Balloch, I took them out to have a look.</p>\n<p>And found I had more than I’d bargained for. Worse, more than I’d paid for. There was an extra book in my bag. One that I had never seen before, that I hadn’t chosen. One with an interesting title.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?1763\"><cite>Again, Dangerous Visions, Book 2</cite></a>, edited by Harlan Ellison.</p>\n<p>My immediate feeling was guilt. I had, effectively, stolen a book. I was a good Catholic boy, and would never have stolen anything.</p>\n<p>Then surprise: how had it got there? Presumably the assistant had mixed it up with the purchases of the person before me. There was probably someone sitting on a train right at that moment, realising that one of their books was missing. Poor them.</p>\n<p>Poor them, but lucky me. I don’t think I told my Mum it had happened. Or if I did, she must have said not to worry, it was too late to do anything; and that doesn’t sound like her. One way or another, we made no attempt to return it.</p>\n<p>But I think among the confusion and excitement of it all, I must have been slightly annoyed that it was the second volume: not much use without that first. And that “Again”: did that mean that the whole thing was some kind of follow-on?</p>\n<p>Obviously I know now that it did. When I went to university a few years later and met a community of fans, when they mentioned the famous <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Visions\"><cite>Dangerous Visions</cite></a> (non-) trilogy, I had some idea of what they were talking about.</p>\n<p>I’d like to say that it was some kind of formative experience. That reading those legendary short stories changed my approach to the genre, or my understanding of fiction, or what have you. But I can’t really say that it did.</p>\n<p>I eventually read the stories. Not having the earlier volumes of an anthology doesn’t cause any problem. Though I think I took the original, <cite>Dangerous Visions</cite> out of the library. Some of them were great, but I don’t recall finding any of them particularly memorable (though you never know: some things burrow deep). But one of the titles stuck with me, and is why I started writing this today.</p>\n<p>That was “A Mouse in the Walls of the Global Village,” by Dean Koontz. Though I couldn’t have told you who it was by, and I’m quite surprised to find that it’s Koontz, who I think of as a horror author.</p>\n<p>It came to mind because of something my beloved was saying about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/26/george-osborne-yuval-noah-harari-conversation?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">this interview between George Osborne and Yuval Noah Harari</a>. She mentioned the “global village” idea, and my mind jumped back to the story and the cascade of memories that go with that book. I downloaded the Kindle version of the book (and the first one) and started writing this.</p>\n<p>As I recall, that global village involved telepathy, and is very much not the one we are living in. But that doesn’t matter. It’s time to reacquaint myself with some old New Wave SF.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

That is, not every bookshop put it in the right section. After all, what is the right section? History? Sociology?

It was published in 1994 and consists of interviews with a selection of the women who were relatively newly on the scene, or were established but getting some more visibility, around that time. It was the time of Riot Grrrl, among other movements.</p>\n<p>So among the interviewees are Courtney Love, Huggy Bear, Liz Phair, Tanya Donnelly, Kristin Hersh, Kim Gordon… even Bjork. But there’s someone missing from the book. Nearly all of the interviewees, when talking about their influences or other women who were doing something interesting at the time, mention PJ Harvey. And she is not interviewed. Which is a shame. I would have loved to have read her thoughts on making music back then (or now, for that matter). And I’m sure Amy Raphael would have loved to interview her, so I’m guessing she didn’t want to do it.</p>\n<p>But aside from that, it’s an interesting work. Very much a document of its time, though no doubt the problems and challenges that these women faced have not changed that much. A similar book today, though, would have a very different complement of interviewees; and indeed would need a different subtitle: women musicians are much more prominent in pop and R&amp;B today, from Beyoncé on down. But maybe not so much in rock, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>Well worth a read, though.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"title": "Some Thoughts On Software Development",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Before the job interview that I <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/19/2461/\">mentioned the other day</a>, the company asked me to answer some questions in writing. I didn’t get the job, but I was pleased with my written answers (and they presumably helped me to get the interview, at least). So I thought I’d reuse them as a blog post. None of this should be surprising for anyone who knows anything about the software development field, but it’s interesting to reflect on how things have changed across my career.</p>\n<h3>What are some of the fundamental changes in your approach to software development you have adopted in the last few years?</h3>\n<p>There are two main changes that are fundamental and independent of languages and deployment environments: agile techniques and test-driven development (TDD).</p>\n<h4>Agile</h4>\n<p>Moving from waterfall to agile development was probably the most significant change to development practices in the industry. We always knew that breaking work down into smaller units led to better estimating, more modular code, and just better software. The genius of agile was to extend that understanding to the period of time spent on a block of work. A two-week sprint, with its work being specifically estimated, planned and developed, is just infinitely more manageable than a project phase lasting months.</p>\n<p>Add to that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>self-organising teams which include someone from the customer or end user — or at least someone whose role is to represent the user;</li>\n<li>accepting that change will happen, and embracing it;</li>\n<li>and the discipline of saying that some features <em>won’t</em> be developed;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and we have a recipe for success.</p>\n<h4>TDD</h4>\n<p>Good developers always understood that testing was essential, and did it. But they used to follow a written test plan, or just have an idea of what needed to be tested and work to that. Testing was manual, hard to repeat, and error-prone.</p>\n<p>TDD brought automation. So instead of writing a document listing the required tests, we can write code. That inherently makes the tests rerunnable, so regressions get caught before they become a problem.</p>\n<p>But almost more important than that is the idea of writing the tests first. In an ideal world you write a comprehensive set of tests, write functional code until all the tests pass, and you’re done. It may not always work out exactly like that — in particular, adding tests to a mature codebase can be problematic — but writing tests first encourages us to write code that is easy to test, which tends to lead to better-designed, more modular code.</p>\n<p>An added bonus is that the tests can help to document the code, by showing our expectations. And of course they make refactoring easy and safe, as long as they are in place before you start.</p>\n<h3>If you were to start your last project over again, what would you do differently?</h3>\n<p>The project I’m thinking of involved rewriting the product’s GUI into a modern, responsive, browser-independent form, using HTML 5 and Twitter Bootstrap.</p>\n<p>The existing version was an old frames-based web app that only worked fully in Internet Explorer, and had to be tweaked when each new version of that browser came out. We had long wanted to modernise it, but there were always other demands on development time.</p>\n<p>Eventually I got a chance to try a proof of concept for the change. The application uses JSPs and Struts action classes, and the brief was to continue using these as much as possible. I decided to start with one of the main display pages, the one that users spend most of their time in. The idea was to give a quick demonstration of what was possible; and it did, to a point. But what I hadn’t realised was that frames are not part of HTML 5. There are ways to keep using them, but it’s not easy, and not good practice.</p>\n<p>So while the new look and feel of a single page was clear, it was far from clear how the various pages would interact, how they would be brought together to form the whole UI,  without frames.</p>\n<p>If I were to start the project again now, my first step would be to work out how to link the pages together into a single interface, in the absence of frames. Most likely I would use one or other of the forms of JSP includes.</p>\n<p>However, if there was the budget to do a more complete rewrite — by which I mean one that did not necessarily seek to use the existing JSPs — I would probably make much greater use of JavaScript and Ajax, and use the action classes just to provide data to the Ajax calls.</p>\n<h3>What is your approach to testing, and how would you test your application?</h3>\n<p>I would use a mixture of automated unit testing using JUnit, automated GUI testing, and actual user testing, if at all possible.</p>\n<p>This fits well with what I was saying above. There are, broadly, three levels of testing: unit, integration, and system. Though writing automated unit tests is a development activity, rather than a testing one. Certainly we wouldn’t expect dedicated QA testers to work at the unit-test level.</p>\n<p>So let’s assume that we have satisfactory unit-test coverage and we are interested in testing the application as a whole. Automation is obviously key here, as well, both because it allows us to easily repeat the tests regularly — for every checkin, in an ideal world (and see below); and because it removes the need for testers to manually step through a written script, which is boring and error-prone.</p>\n<p>I have used Selenium for automated GUI testing, with some success. It takes a significant amount of development work, because it’s doing a significant thing, but the effort should pay off.</p>\n<p>However, even after all that, there is still no alternative to having someone sit down and actually <em>use</em> the application. Automated testing might pick up outright errors in how the user interaction works. But it won’t catch fine details like misaligned elements, typos in onscreen text, or just generally how it feels to use the application.</p>\n<h3>What are the benefits of Continuous Integration?</h3>\n<p>Continuous Integration takes us beyond the traditional daily build. It does more than just building, and does it more frequently than just daily.</p>\n<p>At the simplest level it ensures that, for every commit, an incremental build of the complete product is made, and all the unit tests are run. In the most advanced case, as well as building and testing, the product can be deployed to test servers and integration tests such as the automated GUI tests mentioned above can be run. Realistically those tend to take longer, so it’s unlikely that you would do them for <em>every</em> commit, but they can certainly be run multiple times daily.</p>\n<p>So we get the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>frequent builds catch problems in code integration;</li>\n<li>unit tests are run frequently, catching any regressions;</li>\n<li>integration tests are run regularly, catching other problems;</li>\n<li>general confidence in the product is increased;</li>\n<li>developers are happy to commit changes frequently.</li>\n</ul>\n</body></html>\n",

Or sooner, if May goes to the country over Brexit or otherwise.</p>\n<p>In the end I wonder if Corbyn’s biggest problem isn’t just handling the Media.

Their point – renewing Trident was party policy, so the leader should not be speaking against it – was a valid one, but the floor of the House of Commons during the most important event of the parliamentary week, is not the place to argue about it.\n\nThe idea of Britain still being a nuclear power, and the doctrine of deterrence, are even more ludicrous now than they were during the 80s when I was a member of CND. But like I say, there’s a time and a place to have that argument, and it’s the party conference.\n\nMaya Goodfellow has a great piece about it all in <cite>The Guardian</cite>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe coup itself is unique in recent times, but Labour’s navel gazing is not.<br>\n…<br>\nThe tribalism that grasps the Labour party is part of its problem. There’s an idea among lifelong supporters and MPs that you’re born Labour, you call the party your own and you will never leave it. This makes some sense – these are people whose families for generations have been Labour members, who spend their weekends canvassing and invest all their spare time, emotional energy and money into the party. They want to feel they have control over it.<br>\n…<br>\nBut it [the tribalism] is also partly responsible for the current divisions. The people who feel entitled to call the party their own have competing viewpoints; some of them want to see a leftward shift and others range from wanting Miliband 2.0 to the rebirth of Blairism.<br>\n…<br>\nThe idea too often seems to be “Vote for Labour because we aren’t the Tories”.<br>\n…<br>\nInstead of slinging insults at opponents or branding them all Blairites, Corbyn supporters would do better to focus on the task at hand – winning a future general election.<br>\n<footer> —<cite><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/22/corbyn-labour-crisis-politics-tribalism-winning-elections\">When will Labour’s tribal warfare come to an end?</a></cite></footer>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That idea of the divisions on the left go further than just the Labour party. I thought it was well summed up by this banner that I saw on the Palestine Solidarity march two years ago:\n\n<img style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px\" title=\"Banner on march\" src=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_2826-1.jpg\" alt=\"March with banner showing 'CPGB-ML Communist Pary of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist)'\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" border=\"2\">\n\n“Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist),” it says. You can just feel the layers of splits down the years that have led it to such an unwieldy name. Splits on the left are far from new. It’s an old criticism that we spend more time fighting among ourselves than fighting the real enemies.\n\nOr in this case, than working out how to get back into power. Because going back to Lincoln[^abe] and his compromises, to Hillary and her desire to get things done: it’s all for nothing if we don’t get a Labour government into power.\n\nThe problem is that Corbyn is “unelectable.” Is he? I’m not sure we know that. He’s sometimes compared to Michael Foot, who famously failed to win an election. But things are very different today from how they were in the eighties. It won’t be easy, but a Labour Party that got fully behind a left-wing leader might well be in a position to win power in 2020, when the next election is due. Or sooner, if May goes to the country over Brexit or otherwise.\n\nIn the end I wonder if Corbyn’s biggest problem isn’t just handling the Media. Maybe he needs an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell\">Alistair Campbell</a> figure (or hell, why not: a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Tucker\">Malcolm Tucker</a> one). Does he even <em>have</em> a press secretary or Director of Communications?\n\nAll of this leaves me not knowing how to vote in the new leadership election. My heart is with Corbyn, as most of his policies <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/09/09/leadership/\">match my own principles</a>. But if the MPs won’t get behind him again, then we’ll be right back where we are now, with the party not providing a useful opposition, and with no likelihood of electoral success.[^split]\n\nOwen Smith, on the other hand, seems more likely to fight for us to remain in the EU. But can we trust him?\n\nAnd either way, what will it do to the party as a whole? A party divided against itself, or worse, a party split in two, has no chance of forming a government.</p>\n</body></html>\n\n\n[^spielberg]: Though I wonder whether anyone with less Hollywood power than Spielberg could have got a film made that was so much about talking and legal and political manoeuvring.\n\n[^abe]: No left-winger, of course, though seeing the Republican Party today, it’s impossible to understand how he could have been one of its founders.\n\n[^split]: Because, I contend, of the split, rather then necessarily the leadership.\n",

If you haven’t heard it, it’s on <a href=\"https://itun.es/gb/k4Sj?i=2543099\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1PDRLVAkuiX1javMK1ZBLo\">Spotify</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw4w-kdu_34\">YouTube</a>, where I understand the younglings like to go.\n\n<blockquote>\n  Both guitars got the fuzz tone on<br>\n  The drummer's standing upright pounding along<br>\n  A howl, a tone, a feedback whine<br>\n  Biker boys meet the college kind\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter one of the choruses where he sings, “How in the world were they making that sound?/Velvet Underground,” he says, “Like this,” and launches into a verse of “Sister Ray.” It’s all very, very cool.</body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: Though to be fair, I should thank a group of friends from school that I’m not in touch with anymore for getting me into them. But let’s leave that aside for now.\n\n\n\n[^fn2]: Though let’s face it, we mostly do. If there was a god, and it didn’t want us to listen to loud music, then why would it have invented amplification?\n",

I was considering sending the memory back to Crucial and hoping I could get I refund. But then I tried one more thing. One of the new 8GB sticks along with one of the old 2GB ones.\n\nAnd it booted up, smooth as a cliche.\n\nOf course I tried swapping out one 8GB stick for the other, to check for the possibility that one of them actually was bad. But both of them worked. So it seems that this MacBook can take more than 8GB, but not as much as 16. Which is strange, but never mind.\n\nI'd have to say, though, that the difference in performance wasn't obvious. But I didn't spend  lot of time with it like that, because I still had the SSD to install. That's very slightly more involved, needing as it does a Torx screwdriver. But it's very easy.\n\nBefore all that I had made sure my old hard drive was thoroughly backed up, you won't be surprised to hear.\n\nI booted up in the new configuration and told the Mac to set itself up as a new installation. It downloaded El Capitan over the air and installed away.\n\nThere was one slight glitch in this process. Something went wrong with the installation and I started getting a kernel panic on bootup. I don't quite recall the details now, but I just reformatted the SSD and installed again, and it all went fine.\n\nAnd the difference... The difference is <em>astonishing</em>. Even with many apps open (I currently have twelve), and a whole stack of tabs in Safari, using it is <em>effortless</em>. Apps switch without the slightest lag. I can start anything up with only a few bounces. I've hardly even <em>seen</em> the rainbow.\n\nEven Lightroom, which is the heaviest-weight app I use on here, starts in under ten seconds.\n\nIn short, this is the way a computer should be.</p></body></html>\n",

For Jeremy Corbyn.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a member of the party before.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> I always thought that I was too independent to toe a party line; too many of my anarchist ideals, forged in the fires of punk, still stood.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe. But my anarchism, such as it was, was always on the socialist wing. And I recognise the idealism that drove it. I&rsquo;d like to think that humans could live without governments and leaders &ndash; that we are perfectible, and could form a working society through cooperation. But the fact is, of course, that that is not yet the case. And until it is, there are things worth standing up for, worth believing in. Worth fighting for.</p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to toe a line; but in May we crossed a line. After five years of a Tory government in all but name, we have a named one. David Cameron and his regime will go down in history as worse than Thatcher&rsquo;s; but until he does go down, we have to deal with the effects of it.</p>\n<p>On the morning after the election I resolved to join the Labour party and do what I could to help. This wasn&rsquo;t about electing a new leader, though I realised that would be part of it. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t about Jeremy Corbyn: I made the decision before Ed Miliband had even resigned, and enacted it before the leadership candidates had been nominated.</p>\n<p>And for what it&rsquo;s worth, I joined as a full member, not one of these £3 Supporters that we&rsquo;ve been hearing so much about.</p>\n<p>I think the aftermath of the Scottish referendum had some effect on my decision. Seeing how the failure of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote energised the SNP and led many supporters to join led me to hope that something similar would happen with Labour. As indeed it has.</p>\n<p>Anyway, getting back to that choice of leader. It&rsquo;s long past time that Labour had a woman as its leader, but neither of those standing are right for me. Where we are right now, Corbyn&rsquo;s views most closely match my own values. When he says things like this:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ndash; &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Economy in 2020<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>that is exactly the kind of thing I&rsquo;ve been saying about tax for years.</p>\n<p>There is much else.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>There has been little in the news lately but the refugee crisis and the Labour leadership election. I'm here to talk, briefly, before the polls close on Thursday, about the latter.\n\nI just voted, and guess what? For Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nI've never been a member of the party before.[^fn1] I always thought that I was too independent to toe a party line; too many of my anarchist ideals, forged in the fires of punk, still stood.\n\nWell, maybe. But my anarchism, such as it was, was always on the socialist wing. And I recognise the idealism that drove it. I'd like to think that humans could live without governments and leaders -- that we are perfectible, and could form a working society through cooperation. But the fact is, of course, that that is not yet the case. And until it is, there are things worth standing up for, worth believing in. Worth fighting for.\n\nI didn't want to toe a line; but in May we crossed a line. After five years of a Tory government in all but name, we have a named one. David Cameron and his regime will go down in history as worse than Thatcher's; but until he does go down, we have to deal with the effects of it.\n\nOn the morning after the election I resolved to join the Labour party and do what I could to help. This wasn't about electing a new leader, though I realised that would be part of it. It certainly wasn't about Jeremy Corbyn: I made the decision before Ed Miliband had even resigned, and enacted it before the leadership candidates had been nominated.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I joined as a full member, not one of these £3 Supporters that we've been hearing so much about.\n\nI think the aftermath of the Scottish referendum had some effect on my decision. Seeing how the failure of the \"Yes\" vote energised the SNP and led many supporters to join led me to hope that something similar would happen with Labour. As indeed it has.\n\nAnyway, getting back to that choice of leader. It's long past time that Labour had a woman as its leader, but neither of those standing are right for me. Where we are right now, Corbyn's views most closely match my own values. When he says things like this:\n\n</p><blockquote>\n  Paying tax is not a burden. It is the subscription we pay to live in a civilised society.\n  \n  -- \"<a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/jeremyforlabour/pages/70/attachments/original/1437556345/TheEconomyIn2020_JeremyCorbyn-220715.pdf?1437556345\">The Economy in 2020</a>\"\n</blockquote>\n\nthat is exactly the kind of thing I've been saying about tax for years.\n\nThere is much else. I'm not convinced about leaving NATO, but I don't think it's a fundamental policy. I do think we shouldn't waste vast amounts of money on replacing Trident. The cold war is over, more or less.[^fn2] And even if Russia is getting alarmingly expansionist these days, a British not-really-independent nuclear missile submarine is going to worry them much.\n\nCorbyn might not be electable -- I doubt that analysis, but let's go with it for now -- but he should at least lead a Labour party in opposition that <em>actually opposes the government</em>. Which, with its slim majority, could actually be vulnerable.\n\nInteresting times ahead.</body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: The title of my blog is partly a nod to my long-time support of it, though.\n\n\n\n[^fn2]: I nearly typed \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars\">the cod war</a>\", which is also long over, but was much less terrifying.\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I'm taking the <a href=\"http://tempest.fluidartist.com/non-fiction/the-challenge/\">Tempest Challenge</a>.\n\nI was somewhere in the middle of the <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/03/22/emotionally-weird-by-kate-atkinson-books-2015-3/\">third book</a> I read this year when I heard of it, and I realised that all my reading so far was books by women, and so why not?\n\nThe idea of the challenge, in case you haven't clicked through, is to:\n\n</p><blockquote>\n  take <em><strong>One Year</strong></em> off from reading fiction by straight, white, cisgender male authors and instead read fiction by authors who come from minority or marginalized groups. This includes women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ authors along with a wide variety of other marginalized identities from which to create a reading list: people with disabilities; poor and working class authors; writers with non-Christian religious or spiritual beliefs; and for Americans, even reading books in translation by authors of any background will open up new viewpoints.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhich, when you list as many categories of author as that, sounds pretty easy. And so it is.\n\nSo far, as you'll have seen from my published notes to date, I've just read books by women. No trouble there. I'm currently reading <cite>Wild Seed</cite> by Octavia E Butler, which also adds African-American to the mix.\n\nThe only problem -- and it is, let's face it, a very minor one -- is when I see a book on my shelves that I think, \"Oh, I must read that;\" and then I think, \"but not this year.\" (Though it occurs that if I were to take \"writers with non-Christian religious or spiritual beliefs\" at face value, then I could, for example, carry on my Iain Banks re-read; but such writers -- atheist writers, at least -- are far from marginalised in Britain. And it wouldn't really be in the spirit.)\n\nI'm making two exceptions: one is a book I started last year, about the music scene in New York in the 70s. It's important preparation for our trip to New York in the summer, so I intend to finish that.\n\nThe other is if <a href=\"http://robert-galbraith.com\">Robert Galbraith</a> has a new book out this year. :-) And in getting that link I discover that it's due out in the autumn, which is pleasing to hear.\n\nApparently some people are offended by the very existence of this kind of challenge. Mostly straight white men, I wouldn't be surprised to hear. It's \"censorship\", apparently. I mean, what?\n\nYou'll read all about my reading adventures here.</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>A Christmas present: started on Christmas Day and finished just after midnight on the 3rd of January. So I could call it 2015 number 1, but it makes more sense to go with the year in which I started it and read most of it. Anyway, it’s all a bit arbitrary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vivalbertine.com\">Viv Albertine</a>, as I’m sure you know, was the guitarist in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Slits\">The Slits</a>. They had only a short time in punk’s limelight (though as I learned from this, they released a second album, not just the one I’m familiar with).</p>\n<p>This book is half about her early years and the punk days, and half about after. She went on to work as a filmmaker and then struggled to have a child, had serious health problems. Eventually she re-taught herself to play guitar, and started performing again (I <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/11/13/smashing-things-up-for-35-years/\">saw her supporting the Damned</a> a couple of years back, and then supporting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devilgate/statuses/345925502747435008?tw_i=345925502747435008&amp;tw_e=details&amp;tw_p=archive\">Siouxsie at Meltdown</a> a year and half back).</p>\n<p>It’s really interesting reading about a time I lived through, events I experienced — from afar, true, but still ones I felt part of — from someone else’s point of view. Especially that of someone who was at the heart of many of the events.</p>\n<p>And she writes with some style; it’s a compelling read. She makes some strange choices: for example, she only ever refers to her sister as “my sister”; we never get her name. Similarly with the man she marries. At first he’s “The Biker”, and then “my husband”.</p>\n<p>I suppose it’s a matter of protecting the privacy of people who are still alive — especially in the latter case, because he doesn’t come out of it terribly well. Indeed, it may be the case that the only people who are named are those who were already in the public eye to some degree.</p>\n<p>Any road, if you are into music, especially punk, at all, I would highly recommend reading this. I plan to get her new album — which came out two years ago, it turns out — <cite>The Vermilion Border</cite>.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It&rsquo;s not even the most basic problem of our constitution, though I&rsquo;ll answer that in passing: write it down.</p>\n<p>No, I’m speaking of the problem of the head of state. Now it seems to me to be uncontentious to say that we need to move from a hereditary system to an elected one. The existence of a hereditary element to the government of a democracy is anathema; this is plain.</p>\n<p>But if you suggest this to many (perhaps still most) British citizens,<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> they will speak of a great affection for the Queen; maybe for the monarchy as an institution; and for the pageantry, and how great it is for tourism. Plus they’d point to recent less-than-impressive examples of US presidents, and say something like, “I wouldn’t want President Tony Blair.&quot;\nWell, I could argue against any or all of those.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>There is a solution to one of the great constitutional questions of our age, and I have it.\n\nNot, I might add, the question of making parliament more representative (that’s actually quite an easy one, and we even had a referendum on making it a bit better in this parliament, but we voted the wrong way). Nor indeed the one triggered by the Scottish referendum. It's not even the most basic problem of our constitution, though I'll answer that in passing: write it down.\n\nNo, I’m speaking of the problem of the head of state. Now it seems to me to be uncontentious to say that we need to move from a hereditary system to an elected one. The existence of a hereditary element to the government of a democracy is anathema; this is plain.\n\nBut if you suggest this to many (perhaps still most) British citizens,[^fn1] they will speak of a great affection for the Queen; maybe for the monarchy as an institution; and for the pageantry, and how great it is for tourism. Plus they’d point to recent less-than-impressive examples of US presidents, and say something like, “I wouldn’t want President Tony Blair.\"\nWell, I could argue against any or all of those. But there’s no need to. Here’s the thing: as soon as we want to, we could switch to having an elected head of state, <em>without</em> losing any of the positives there, or introducing the negatives.\n\nWell, we’d have to lose the Queen; the actual, current one, Elizabeth II. But that’s no problem: there won’t be any serious talk of change in her lifetime anyway. And probably not in Charlie’s for that matter.\nBut at some point in the future we could have an elected head of state, and still keep the monarchy, the pageantry, and the palaces.\n\nHow? We just redefine the words “monarch”, “king”, and “queen”.\n\nWe redefine them to be the title of the elected head of state in the UK. We elect one every few years — four, six, eight, it doesn’t really matter — <em>and we keep everything else exactly the same</em>.\n\nBecause of course, we’re a constitutional monarchy. The monarch has no real power, officially,[^fn2] except to ask the leader of the party with most seats at a general election to form a government.\n\nThe rest is window-dressing: pageantry and symbolism. The individual doing the job could as easily be one chosen by the electorate as one assigned the task by chance of birth.[^fn3]\n\nSure, such a person would be a president — a powerless president — in all but name.

But even that wouldn't be a problem. Those oaths are worded something like, \"to Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors.\" The new, elected monarch would indeed be the \"successor\" of the last hereditary one.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_monarchy\">It turns out</a>, not surprisingly, that this idea has been thought of before.

And I wanted to read this expanded edition when it first came out. Although it’s called “The Final Chapter”, as if it were purely an additional piece, it contains both the original book and the new work — which is a lot more than just a “chapter”. But it was always just ferociously expensive. </p>\n<p>Like, old-school hardback price for a large-format paperback. And it never seemed to come down, or come to in a smaller-size, mass-market paperback edition. So it always just felt too daunting.</p>\n<p>Then eventually I saw it was on Kindle for what seemed like a more reasonable price, so I grabbed it.</p>\n<p>It’s nothing more or less than an edited, long, email conversation between Davies and Cook. Sometimes several emails a day, in which Cook asks Davies questions about the latter’s writing process and other aspects of making <cite>Doctor Who</cite> (and to a lesser extent <cite>Torchwood</cite> and <cite>The Sarah Jane Adventures</cite>).</p>\n<p>And it’s absolutely fascinating read, especially if you’re at all interested in the creative process, in how writers write, and so on. It also feels a bit like you’re eavesdropping on someone else’s conversation at times, Somehow that’s not a problem, though. After all, it’s an interesting conversation, and we’ve been invited to listen in.</p>\n<p>It’s clear that Davies enjoys sharing his thoughts on his process in this way, and it sort of makes you wonder why he doesn’t blog. But then, if he had been writing these emails as blog posts at the time, he couldn’t possibly have shared as much as he did with Cook, and with us several years after the events.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I don’t think they’re very popular there.</p>\n<p>Then again, they’re not very popular anywhere.</p>\n<p>Back before the the coalition, when the Lib Dems were the third party, they always spoke in favour of coalition government. They always said that they would work with anyone if it they ever held the balance of power.</p>\n<p>Then when it looked there was going to be a hung parliament, and when there actually was, they still said that they would work with either Labour or the Tories in order to bring a government into being.</p>\n<p>The trouble is, no-one really believed them.</p>\n<p>OK, I can only really speak for myself; but I’m probably not that unusual. The Lib Dems were always seen as being closer to Labour than to the Tories. There was the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib%E2%80%93Lab_pact\">Lib-Lab pact</a> back in the seventies. And all through the New Labour years, they were generally seen as being further left than Labour.</p>\n<p>So when they held the balance of power in 2010, it was obvious — so we all thought, I say — that they would work with Labour, rather than the Tories.</p>\n<p>Alas, it was not to be. Imagine how different the country might be now if Clegg had swung the right way back then. The country wouldn’t have been half-destroyed by Osbourne’s “austerity” measures. (I mean, <em>really</em>: haven’t they learned by now that you don’t cut public spending in a recession?)</p>\n<p>Of course, there have been some good things during the coalition: marriage equality; the Scottish referendum (irrespective of how it turned out, Cameron agreed to it). There was even — if you recall — a referendum on electoral reform. Remember that?</p>\n<p>No, me neither. It was a fix (since it got voted down), but I don’t recall how. Oh, yes wait: the anti-reform camp <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/05/03/lets-all-say-yes/\">made a big thing</a> of how much more complex than first-past-the-post the alternative vote (AV) system would be. When in fact it’s <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/kk2lZ.jpg\">quite simple</a>. And I guess they got the friendly media working against it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, now they’ve been all but wiped out in yesterday’s by election. The worst thing about that is that UKIP seem to be in danger of replacing them as the third party.</p>\n<p>Scary but interesting times.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

The \"40% Rule\", which caused the referendum to fail (the majority had to comprise 40% of the electorate) was brought in by a Labour MP's amendment; and when it fell, according to the Wikipedia article:\n\n<blockquote>\n  the government's decision to abandon devolution for Scotland led the Scottish National Party to withdraw its support for the government. A subsequent vote of no confidence led to the resignation of the Callaghan government, and an election was called.\n</blockquote>\n\nThat election was the one that got Thatcher elected.\n\nMaybe she'd have been elected at the next election whenever it happened; but maybe not. And I can't help but think that the Labour party has a disturbing sideline in betraying the people it should be serving, and this -- and the current Labour party's staunchly pro-union stance -- is an example of it.

That is distinctly unappealing\n\nJust as a minor aside, something I had totally forgotten was that the 1979 referendum wasn't for independence: it was only to have an assembly, which sounds a lot like the Scottish Parliament of today.\n\n<h2>The Rest?</h2>\n\nI used the term \"RoUK\" above. That's the way people have been referring to the \"rest of the UK\", meaning what's left of the UK after Scotland leaves. But I'm not so sure that there should really be any such thing.\n\nSee, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland came into existence when the Republic of Ireland got its independence from Britain, leaving Northern Ireland still connected. But the \"Great Britain\" part (as a political entity, as opposed to the island): <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain\">that came into existence with the Acts of Union</a>.\n\nRepeal those Acts and arguably Great Britain ceases to exist as a political entity; so how can the UK exist after that happens?\n\nSo rather than debating whether an independent Scotland will be able to remain in the EU will have to rejoin it from outside, we should be discussing what, exactly, will be left if Scotland leaves the union.\n\n<h2>Salmond and the anti-personality cult</h2>\n\nIt disturbs me how many Scots seem to be basing their decision around personality. \"Salmond's a wanker\", and all that kind of thing. If the vote goes yes, Salmond can retire (arguably the SNP will no longer have a reason to exist, in fact). But anyway, governments change, they can be voted out; people die. It's not like you're voting to make Salmond president for life. Rather, you're voting for the type of country that your children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren will inherit.\n\n<h2>Other voices</h2>\n\nBefore I end, some other pieces that I've been reading on the matter. As <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/irvine-welsh-the-scots-poll-can-give-hope-to-the-left-across-britain-9559111.html\">Irvine Welsh has said</a>, this is a great time for political engagement in Scotland.[^fn3] And <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/comment/columnists/why-scottish-independence-would-help-england-to-rediscover-its-radical-heart.25189347\">Billy Bragg adds</a> that it might be good politically for England too.\n\nAnd <a href=\"http://upholdingenglishhonour.com/2014/07/16/dear-eddie-izzard-and-friends-please-dont-go-on-please-listen-to-why-its-ok-for-us-english-to-let-scotland-go/\">here's a blog by an English guy</a> who favours Scottish independence. He also favours English and Welsh independence, it seems: the complete breakup of the UK; just look at his masthead. His blog has the slightly disturbing title of \"Upholding English Honour\", but he doesn't seem to be the little Englander that name might imply.\n\n<a href=\"http://forums.millarworld.tv/index.php?/topic/104960-i-keep-seeing-this-disinfo-on-scotlands-voting-record/\">Mark Millar is undecided</a>, but calls for better behaviour all round in the debate. And <a href=\"http://jackdeighton.co.uk/2014/07/26/scotlands-literature-and-scottish-independence/\">Jack Deighton considers the effect that the referendum might have on Scottish literature</a>.\n\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\n\nIn the end, of course, my opinion means nothing. But here it is anyway. If I were living in Scotland, I'm now fairly sure that I'd be voting yes. And speaking as an attached outsider, I'm coming round to hoping that the vote goes that way; if only to see what happens next.\n\nAfter all, it could be the beginning of a great adventure.</body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: That post is actually about floating voters; not quite the same thing, but not unrelated.\n\n[^fn2]: Weirdly, when I searched Amazon for Hugh MacDiarmid's <cite>A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle</cite>, the second hit was <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Scotland-Our-Britain-Sharing-ebook/dp/B00IQ8UBVG/\"><cite>My Scotland, Our Britain: A Future Worth Sharing</cite>, by Gordon Brown</a>.\n\n\n[^fn3]: That link is showing \"Service unavailable\" at the time of writing.

And they’re hard-drinking ones at that. But that kind of goes without saying.</p>\n<p>As the novel starts it is 1959 and the first-person narrator is wanderer, unsure of what he wants to do with his life. He is leaving New York for Puerto Rico, to take up a post on the English-language paper there.</p>\n<p>The story charts the ups and downs of his life over the next few months, along with various other people, mainly involved with the paper. It’s an entertaining enough read, but largely inconsequential as a story. You couldn’t really say that the character has grown or developed much by the end, and while we get some insight into the way the US was interacting with Puerto Rico at the time (unspoilt beaches being sold to developers to build luxury hotel complexes, that kind of thing), I wouldn’t say you get a great sense of Puerto Rico itself.</p>\n<p>It’s mainly interesting for showing some early flashes of the writing style that Thompson would develop over the subsequent years into his signature gonzo style. For example: </p>\n<p>&gt; They ran the whole gamut from genuine talents and honest men, to degenerates and hopeless losers who could barely write a postcard–loons and fugitives and dangerous drunks</p>\n<p>Not up there with <cite>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</cite>, obviously, but you can see the beginnings of that style.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I stayed with the Culture books, skipping over the non-Culture SF ones, <cite>Against a Dark Background</cite> and <cite>Feersum Endjinn</cite>. That brought me to <cite>Excession</cite>, in many ways Banksie’s Culture masterwork. Certainly it’s​ the first in which the ships take such central, starring roles, which makes it the defining one for me.</p>\n<p>I remembered much more of this (I’ve definitely read it more than once before), but there were still bits that were only fuzzy at best. It is galaxy-spanning, “widescreen baroque” space opera at its best.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t finished it by the time we went on holiday, so I had to take it with me with only a hundred or so pages to go. That was mildly annoying, but it didn’t take us over our weight limit.</p>\n<p>The next Culture novel to be published is <cite>Inversions</cite>, but I didn’t quite feel like reading it, because I was keen to get to <cite>Look to Windward</cite>. I feel as if I’ve been wanting to reread that almost since I first read it. So I took it with me, and with only a brief interruption to finish <cite>The Magus</cite> in the appropriate country, as <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2013/09/21/the-summer-of-rereading-1-the-magus-by-john-fowles/\">I’ve already discussed</a>, I stormed into it.</p>\n<p>And, err, it was a bit disappointing, actually.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing about not remembering books though: I remembered almost nothing about this. I <em>thought</em> I remembered it, but really I only had the setup (the business of waiting for the light from the stars destroyed in the Culture-Idiran War to arrive) and one brief scene near the end. This had the great positive that it was almost like reading a new Culture novel.</p>\n<p>The trouble with it is that the plot is quite thin, and mostly happening off stage. And a lot of the events that happen in between​ are only really there to show off some of the fantasicness of living on a Culture orbital. In a sense it tries to do exactly what Banksie himself said you can’t really do, which is to set a story in a utopia. This is why the Culture novels general focus on someone working for Special Circumstances or at least Contact; they happen at the edges of the utopia, or just outside its fringes, where things are a lot more dangerous.</p>\n<p>There is an ongoing threat to at least one of the main characters, but it doesn’t really engage us all that much. We don’t, perhaps, care all that much about what happens to them.</p>\n<p>That said, there are still some great moments. But I wonder whether my expectations, set by my memory of really enjoying it, were too high. It’s often best to approach artistic works with lowered expectations.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I don&rsquo;t mind an ambiguous ending.

What were they trying to achieve?</p>\n<p>Ultimately I suppose that can be answered in part by Fowles&rsquo;s argument regarding people asking about the &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of the novel:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So the Godgame&rsquo;s meaning or purpose may be simply the reaction it provokes in Nicholas; but that still leaves us wondering, as I said above, why did Conchis do it?

No doubt there were some in academic journals and theses, but finding those would have been difficult. Now, of course, such discussions are easy to find. And the most interesting one I found recently was by Jo Walton on Tor.com: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twists of the Godgame: John Fowles&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Magus<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

But the argument that &ldquo;Fowles doesn’t know what he’s doing, that the underlying reality that is never explained doesn’t make sense&rdquo; rings true for me. And so when she says that &ldquo;what Chiang’s &lsquo;The Story of Your Life&rsquo; does is what Fowles may have wanted to do&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m inclined to suspect that she&rsquo;ll be proved right when I come to read the Chiang.</p>\n<p>I still loved the book, though: you can enjoy the journey even if you&rsquo;re not entirely happy with the destination.

Not if you want to know whether or not Nicholas and Alison get back together, which seems to have been what his correspondents regarding the original edition were concerned about.\n\nBut that's not what bothered me, either then or now. I don't mind an ambiguous ending. And I actually kind of like the way you can think of it as a freeze-frame, like the ending of a film (<cite>Bonnie and Clyde</cite> ends like that, if I remember correctly -- though in a more dramatic event).[^fn1]\n\nNo, what annoys me is that we never really learn what Conchis and the others were up to. They called their project \"The Godgame\" (it was also Fowles's proposed title for the novel at one point); but what was the point of it? What were they trying to achieve?\n\nUltimately I suppose that can be answered in part by Fowles's argument regarding people asking about the \"meaning\" of the novel:\n\n<blockquote>\n  If <cite>The Magus</cite> has any \"real significance\", it is no more than that of the Rorschach Test in psychology. Its meaning is whatever reaction it provokes in the reader[.]\n</blockquote>\n\nSo the Godgame's meaning or purpose may be simply the reaction it provokes in Nicholas; but that still leaves us wondering, as I said above, why did Conchis do it? Was it just the whim of a rich man? He did it because he could? And yet mere whim feels weak alongside all the discussion of freedom and what it means.\n\nIn the end the mild sense of frustration remains, because we never find that out.\n\nBack when I first read it, there was no immediately obvious way to find discussions of it. No doubt there were some in academic journals and theses, but finding those would have been difficult. Now, of course, such discussions are easy to find. And the most interesting one I found recently was by Jo Walton on Tor.com: <a href=\"http://www.tor.com/blogs/2009/11/twists-of-the-godgame-john-fowless-lemgthe-maguslemg\">Twists of the Godgame: John Fowles's <cite>The Magus</cite></a>. As Walton says, the ending \"twists at just the wrong moment and sends it away from metaphysics into triviality and romance.\"\n\nShe goes on to compare it to Ted Chiang’s “The Story of Your Life”, which I haven't read. But the argument that \"Fowles doesn’t know what he’s doing, that the underlying reality that is never explained doesn’t make sense\" rings true for me. And so when she says that \"what Chiang’s 'The Story of Your Life' does is what Fowles may have wanted to do\", I'm inclined to suspect that she'll be proved right when I come to read the Chiang.\n\nI still loved the book, though: you can enjoy the journey even if you're not entirely happy with the destination. Walton's conclusion gives a hilarious suggestion for how it could have been improved, though:\n\n<blockquote>\n  It’s beautifully written. The characters are so real I’d recognise them if I saw them at the bus-stop. And there’s nothing wrong with it that couldn’t be fixed by having them go off in an alien space ship at the end.\n</blockquote>\n\nNow that would have been an ending.</body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: Apparently there was a film of the book made. It's considered to be so bad that (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magus_%28novel%29\">according to Wikipedia</a>) Woody Allen said if he had his life to live again he'd do everything the same, except he wouldn't see <cite>The Magus</cite>.\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>With <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite> fever in full swing (to mix a metaphor), I've been thinking about the book a lot today. I tweeted yesterday that I had never really got what all the fuss was about.\n\n</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Want to see the _Great Gatsby_ movie, yet despite re-reading the book last summer, I fail to see what people think is so good about it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23fb\">#fb</a>— Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/336140686527168514\">May 19, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>I find it hard to explain what I find problematic about it. I wouldn't say it's <em>bad</em>, just that it's not as good as nearly everyone says it is. I see it as largely being about rich people having parties, and a couple of tragic deaths. And while I don't think that you have to like -- or even identify with -- all the characters for fiction to work, in this case none of them has any redeeming feature, as far as I can tell.\n\nThere's a recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/03/what-makes-great-gatsby\">article in the Guardian by Sarah Churchwell</a> about how wonderful it all is. It's a well-written piece, but I find it just as hard to get to grips with, to understand the point of, as the novel itself.\n\nSo I did a search for \"Gatsby overrated\", and found <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/05/schulz-on-the-great-gatsby.html\">this piece by Kathryn Schulz</a> which absolutely nails it.\n\nOne point she makes perhaps helps to explain why I find the characters so objectionable:\n\n</p><blockquote>\n  Like many American moralists, Fitzgerald was more offended by pleasure than by vice, and he had a tendency to confound them. In The Great Gatsby, polo and golf are more morally suspect than murder.\n</blockquote>\n\nAnd:\n\n<blockquote>\n  On the page, Fitzgerald’s moralizing instinct comes off as cold; the chill that settles around The Great Gatsby is an absence of empathy.\n</blockquote>\n\nMy favourite part is her parenthetical assertion that:\n\n<blockquote>\n  In a literary hostage exchange, I would trade a thousand Fitzgeralds for one Edward St. Aubyn, 10,000 for an Austen or Dickens.\n</blockquote>\n\nThough I had to look up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_St_Aubyn\">Edward St. Aubyn</a>.\n\nBut her main argument concerns the shallowness of the characterisations, the emphasis on symbolism over emotion:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Of the great, redemptive romance on which the entire story is supposed to turn, he admitted, “I gave no account (and had no feeling about or knowledge of) the emotional relations between Gatsby and Daisy.”\n  \n  What was Fitzgerald doing instead of figuring out such things about his characters? Precision-engineering his plot, chiefly, and putting in overtime at the symbol factory.\n</blockquote>\n\nFor me, though, as I think on it some more, the problem with it all (and in contradiction to the last quote above) is the thinness of the plot. The prose is famously poetic in places, and that's fine; but the real weakness is that there's almost no story there.\n\nAnd that famous last line[^fn1]?  Poetic though it is, when you parse it, it means absolutely nothing at all.</body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: \"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\", as I'm sure you know.\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I never really got Instagram.  I mean, I got the app, I signed up, and I posted a few photos.  But I never totally got what it was for.  I mean, social photos?  OK, I followed a few people I knew on Twitter, but it never really amounted to much.  And you couldn't even see your pictures on the web at first.  The filters were interesting, but only up to a point, and <a href=\"http://www.myglasseye.net/news/2011/09/instagram-2-0-review-insta-grumble/\">they got worse</a>.\n\nBut somehow I could never totally see the point.  Flickr I understood: it's a site to store your photos.  If you don't have, or don't want the bother of managing, your own web space, you can put your pictures there and show them to other people.  And it's got the social thing going on, too, with the ability to follow people and all that.  It feels a bit bolted on, but it does no harm.  And when I discover a site like <a href=\"http://500px.com\">500px</a>, as I did a few weeks ago, well, that's obvious: a place to store your pictures and to find other people's.  Not for nothing is their tag line, \"The best photos on the web\" (or it was: today it says, \"The world's best photo sharing\", which is similar, but different).  I just wish they'd learn how to keep me signed in.\n\nBut Instagram didn't really grab me.  And today they nearly ejected me.\n\nOddly for a net-based thing, I heard about <a href=\"http://blog.instagram.com/post/38143346554/privacy-and-terms-of-service-changes-on-instagram\">the new terms of service</a> on the radio.  The story was that the terms were going to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/dec/18/facebook-instagram-sell-uploaded-photos\">allow them to sell their users' pictures for advertising</a>, without paying, asking, or even telling the users.\n\nI tweeted:\n\n</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Did I just hear on the radio that Instagram is committing suicide?— Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/281093504560660480\" data-datetime=\"2012-12-18T17:48:08+00:00\">December 18, 2012</a></blockquote>\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>It turns out to be not <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/18/instagram-suicide-note_n_2323100.html\">as bad as we thought</a>, at least according to <a href=\"http://blog.instagram.com/post/38252135408/thank-you-and-were-listening\">this post from Instagram</a>.  Though I only found that because I clicked the \"I'd like to delete my account\" link.  On the confirmation page there was a link to that post.  It turns out there's an Instagram blog, and both the terms of service change and this update were posted there.  But who knew about that?\n\nSo for now I haven't deleted my account, and we'll see how it goes.\n\nI found out about the change from the radio, and the correction by requesting a deletion; my inbox remains unsullied.

My concerns were the cost, the crowding, and the general disruption of it all.  I was, I admit, cynical.  I recall being annoyed by the fact that the people running the bid published a number to which you could text &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, to say you supported the bid; but there was no option to text &ldquo;no&rdquo; to say you opposed it.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking back to what I wrote at the time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I see that my biggest concern was the effect on the Lower Lee Valley.  It turned out that the removal of wilderness didn&rsquo;t stretch as far as my fears suggested; and of course much of the land that has been used was polluted, abandoned, brownfield industrial sites.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><h2>Initial scepticism</h2>\n\nBack in 2004, 2005 or so, when London was bidding to host the Olympics, I was against it.  My concerns were the cost, the crowding, and the general disruption of it all.  I was, I admit, cynical.  I recall being annoyed by the fact that the people running the bid published a number to which you could text \"yes\", to say you supported the bid; but there was no option to text \"no\" to say you opposed it.\n\n<a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2005/07/06/2012/\">Looking back to what I wrote at the time</a>, I see that my biggest concern was the effect on the Lower Lee Valley.  It turned out that the removal of wilderness didn't stretch as far as my fears suggested; and of course much of the land that has been used was polluted, abandoned, brownfield industrial sites.  Bob Stanley of St Etienne (the band) has an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/24/olympics-changed-lower-lea-valley?mobile-redirect=false\">interesting piece in <cite>The Guardian</cite></a> about that.\n\n<h2>Coming round</h2>\n\nBut then London won the bid, and I though, \"OK, fine, it'll be interesting at least.\"  I had enjoyed watching the previous ones, and there was the regeneration for East London that looked promising.  And the fact that it would just be down the road for me added to the interest.  After all, that would make it easier to get tickets, right?  Obviously there would specific tickets made available to to locals.\n\nHindsight even makes me wonder whether the <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2005/07/07/today/\">events of the very next day</a> didn't make me more supportive: blitz spirit, don't let the bastards grind you down, \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power\">soft power</a>\", and all that.\n\n<h2>The intervening years</h2>\n\n<h3>Worries</h3>\n\nIn the years since then I've gone through various thoughts about the whole thing.

Of course more recently we've had the G4S fiasco, and the drafting in of extra soldiers.\n\nMore bizarrely we've seen the growth of the Olympic \"brand police\", the forbidding of certain words and combinations of words (including, ridiculously, things like \"summer\", \"bronze\", and \"2012\").\n\n<h3>Cycle-friendly or not?</h3>\n\nBut closer to home one of the things that has annoyed me is the way they've treated our towpath.\n\nThe main stadium sits between two branches of the River Lee (or Lea): the river itself, and the Lee Navigation or Cut, which is essentially a canal constructed as a tributary[^trib] of the main river.

				"title": "Tip: using Pandoc to create truly standalone HTML files",
				"content_html": "<p>If you’re using the excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pandoc<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to convert between different document formats, and you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>want your final output to be in HTML;</li>\n<li>want the HTML to be styled with CSS;</li>\n<li>and want the HTML document to be truly standalone;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>then read on.</p>\n<p>The most common approach with Pandoc is, I think, to write in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Markdown<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and then convert the output to RTF, PDF or HTML. There are all sorts of more advanced options too; but here we are only concerned with HTML.</p>\n<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pandoc<!-- raw HTML omitted --> command has an option which allows you to style the resulting HTML with CSS. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Example 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the User’s Guide shows how you do this, with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-c<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option. The example also uses the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option, which means that we are creating a standalone HTML document, as distinct from a fragment that is to be embedded in another document. The full command is:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\">pandoc -s -S --toc -c pandoc.css -A footer.html README -o example3.html\n</code></pre></div><p>If you inspect the generated HTML file after running this, you will see it contains a line like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\">&lt;<span style=\"color:#f92672\">link</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">rel</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;stylesheet&#34;</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">href</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;pandoc.css&#34;</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">type</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;text/css&#34;</span>&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>That links to the CSS stylesheet, keeping the formatting information separate from the content. Very good practice if you’re publishing a document on the web.</p>\n<p>But what about that “standalone” idea that you expressed with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option? What that does is make sure that the HTML is a complete document, beginning with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DOCTYPE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag, an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;html&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag, and so on.

				"content_text": "\nIf you’re using the excellent <a title=\"A command-line tool for converting between various document formats.\" href=\"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html\">Pandoc</a> to convert between different document formats, and you:\n\n- want your final output to be in HTML;\n- want the HTML to be styled with CSS;\n- and want the HTML document to be truly standalone;\n\nthen read on.\n\nThe most common approach with Pandoc is, I think, to write in <a title=\"Plain-text writing for the web.\" href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a>, and then convert the output to RTF, PDF or HTML. There are all sorts of more advanced options too; but here we are only concerned with HTML.\n\nThe <code>pandoc</code> command has an option which allows you to style the resulting HTML with CSS. <a href=\"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demos.html\">Example 3</a> in the User’s Guide shows how you do this, with the <code>-c</code> option. The example also uses the <code>-s</code> option, which means that we are creating a standalone HTML document, as distinct from a fragment that is to be embedded in another document. The full command is:\n\n```shell\npandoc -s -S --toc -c pandoc.css -A footer.html README -o example3.html\n```\n\nIf you inspect the generated HTML file after running this, you will see it contains a line like this:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"pandoc.css\" type=\"text/css\">\n```\n\nThat links to the CSS stylesheet, keeping the formatting information separate from the content. Very good practice if you’re publishing a document on the web.\n\nBut what about that “standalone” idea that you expressed with the <code>-s</code> option? What that does is make sure that the HTML is a complete document, beginning with a <code>DOCTYPE</code> tag, an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag, and so on. But if, for example, you have to email the document you just created, or upload it to your company’s document store, then things fall apart. When your reader opens it, they’ll see what you wrote, all right; but it won’t be styled the way you wanted it. Because that <code>pandoc.css</code> file with the styling is back on your machine, in the same directory as the original Markdown file.\n\nWhat you really want is to use embedded CSS; you want the content of <code>pandoc.css</code> to be included along with the prose you wrote in your HTML file.\n\nLuckily HTML supports that, and Pandoc provides a way to make it all happen: the <code>-H</code> option, or using its long form, <code>--include-in-header=FILE</code>\n\nFirst you’ll have to make sure that your <code>pandoc.css</code> file<sup><a id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnoteRef\" href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> starts and ends with HTML <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags, so it should look something like this:\n\n```html\n<style type=\"text/css\">\nbody {\n    margin: auto;\n    padding-right: 1em;\n    padding-left: 1em;\n    max-width: 44em; \n    border-left: 1px solid black;\n    border-right: 1px solid black;\n    color: black;\n    font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\n    font-size: 100%;\n    line-height: 140%;\n    color: #333; \n}\n</style>\n```\n\nThen run the <code>pandoc</code> command like this:\n\n```shell\npandoc -s -S --toc -H pandoc.css -A footer.html README -o example3.html\n```\n\nand you’re done. A fully standalone HTML document.\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr>\n\n<ol>\n    <li id=\"fn1\">It doesn’t have to be called that, by the way.<a href=\"#fnref1\">↩</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It&rsquo;s also just long; and technical.  So feel free to ignore.  I won&rsquo;t be offended.</p>\n<p>I rarely write about programming or other technical issues here, but I probably should do so more often.  Certainly in a case like this.</p>\n<p>I often think about the many, many problems that I&rsquo;ve had help with from strangers on the internet; people who have taken the time to write blog posts, answers to questions on forums, or technology tutorials.  My job would barely be possible at times without the web.  Of course, we didn&rsquo;t have it back when I started in 1987; but we didn&rsquo;t do such complex things, with so many different languages and technologies.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all these kind strangers have helped me, and I rarely find myself in a position to give anything back to the community.  So since I recently hit a problem that no-one else seems to have had, it&rsquo;s really my duty to describe it, and my solution, in the hope that it might be of use to someone down the line.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the solution to the problem with pass-by reference on WAS, and don&rsquo;t want to read the story of how I got there, you can jump straight to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New Bug<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We develop our main app using a fairly standard <!-- raw HTML omitted -->n-tier<!-- raw HTML omitted --> architecture using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JEE<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: web front end using JSPs and Struts; EJBs; a multiplicity of database platforms accessed using Spring.  All fairly standard stuff, whose purpose is to move financial messages around.</p>\n<p>A lot of this was originally developed when I wasn&rsquo;t around (I was seconded to another department) and by contractors and others who are no longer with us.  So I take no responsibility for the stupidities that exist in codebase.  Or rather, I accept no blame.  I do, in fact, have responsibility for it; for keeping it going and developing it onwards now.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>One of the bad choices that was made by the original developers of this version of the product, was that they should cache the results of database queries.  The users can define various criteria by which they want to select a set of messages to view; those get translated into SQL, which our Java code executes using JDBC.  Again, all standard stuff.  JDBC was designed for exactly that kind of thing.  Databases exist solely to do that kind of thing.</p>\n<p>So the wise and sensible developers decided that performance would be a problem if a query returned many rows from the database.  They decided that transferring the rows to the browser and allowing the user to scroll through them would be impossible.  So they designed a caching mechanism.</p>\n<p>Thing is, JDBC has that kind of caching built right in.  And furthermore, they (our developers) included a limit: a maximum number of rows to return, which could be set to 50, 100, 500, or 1000.  Pretty reasonable, since any query that returned over 200 or so rows is likely to be less than useful, anyway.</p>\n<p>But they still built that caching mechanism.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>That&rsquo;s all right, though, I hear you say.  Cache the rows server-side in memory, return a subset to the user as they page through them.  It sounds fine.</p>\n<p>True enough.  Except they didn&rsquo;t cache them in memory.  Oh no.  That would have been too sensible.  And might have caused performance problems (I&rsquo;m sure they thought, if they even considered they matter).  No, they cached them elsewhere.  Where?  In the database.</p>\n<p>Yes, they introduced another table; a shadow table; an almost-identical duplicate of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Messages<!-- raw HTML omitted --> table, called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MessageQueryResults<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Executing a query then consisted of selecting the required rows and writing them into this table, keyed by the HTTP session ID; and then re-querying this results table to get a page worth of results.</p>\n<p>So, to recap, then: to improve performance (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->without first determining that there was actually a problem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), they replaced a simple database read with a read, a set of writes, and another set of reads.</p>\n<p>That was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bound<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to perform better, right?</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t performance that brought this flimsy edifice crashing down, though.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> No, it actually ran quite successfully for several years.  Three things brought about its end: Microsoft, multiplicity, and me.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s part was through their database platform, SQL Server.  Between one version and another they changed something about their storage mechanism, so that you could no longer rely on rows on a table being in the sequence in which they were written to the table.  The thing is, you&rsquo;re not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->supposed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to be able to rely on that, according to DB theory.  That was another flaw in the &ldquo;design&rdquo; above; it relied on the shadow table&rsquo;s rows being returned in the same sequence they were written in.

A maintenance nightmare.</p>\n<p>Then there was me.  I had known about the problem for some time, of course &ndash; I had done an estimate for fixing it &ndash; but there was never time to fix it.

Yes, I know ease of maintenance, by making life easier for developers, is an implicit customer benefit; but try selling that to management, when there are customers crying out for new features.</p>\n<p>But in the project that was to introduce the fourth table (or seventh and eighth, you might say) I was in a position to say, &ldquo;we fix this first, or it all goes to hell&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The user story was written.  I got my estimate out of hibernation (and increased it, of course).  And then I did the fix.  It was a great joy.  That in-memory caching mechanism I mentioned above?  I did that.   If I&rsquo;d been designing it from scratch I would almost certainly have relied on JDBC&rsquo;s internal caching, at least until it proved problematic.  But under the circumstances, when the code relied on there being a cache, it was going to be much less disruptive to retain one.  I just replaced the stupid one with a more sensible one.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, though, I introduced a new bug.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This is where I stop telling a story and start explaining the problem and solution.</p>\n<p>Introducing the new message caching mechanism, which replaced the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MessageQueryResults<!-- raw HTML omitted --> table, inadvertently caused a problem when we set a WAS server to pass-by-reference mode.</p>\n<p>This mode is recommended when the different tiers of the application (web, EJB) are running in the same JVM.

As soon as it was turned on, we noticed that taking certain actions, such as deleting a message, failed.</p>\n<p>The failure was at a point in the code where the a value such as an amount was being retrieved from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that formed the new cache.  The failure was that the retrieved <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Object<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was being cast to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Number<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but what was in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> entry was actually a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->String<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>This <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> comes, by a fairly complex set of steps, from the new cache, and before that from the database itself, of course.</p>\n<p>Now, since the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amount<!-- raw HTML omitted --> column on the DB is numeric, and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in question is originally populated via Spring from the DB, obviously the value was a numeric one originally.  This suggested that the value must have been changed, and that gave us the first clue to tracking down the cause of the problem, and coming up with a solution.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It seemed likely &ndash; and running debug, it was shown to be so &ndash; that the numeric value that was retrieved from the database and stored in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was being replaced by the edited value which is built for displaying.  In other words, the object now contained a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->String<!-- raw HTML omitted --> holding digits, a decimal point, and probably commas.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>When the data was being passed by value, a new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, complete with its contents, was being passed from the EJB layer to the webapp.  The webapp then updated values in that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, editing them for display purposes.  But it was only changing its own copy; it had no effect on the version stored back in the EJB layer.  So when the same <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was retrieved again, so that the action could be performed, a new copy was received by the webapp.  No problem.</p>\n<p>But when pass-by-reference is on, no copy is made.  The webapp receives a reference to the actual <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that is stored in the cache back in the EJB layer.  So when it updates an entry in that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it updates the very object that is stored in the cache (note that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->put<!-- raw HTML omitted --> method of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> interface will update the stored value if it receives a key that it already holds).</p>\n<p>And then when the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and its entry are retrieved again for the action to be performed, it is the updated (and now wrong) version that is retrieved.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And yet both possible passing settings were available before we changed the caching mechanism.  Why did we not get this problem when using pass-by-reference with the old caching mechanism?</p>\n<p>The answer to that is that the old mechanism cached the query results in the database itself, in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MessageQueryResults<!-- raw HTML omitted --> table.  Each time a set of results was requested by the webapp, the EJB layer went back to this temporary table and populated the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that it returned to the webapp.  So the amount value would always have been set up freshly from the numeric <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amount<!-- raw HTML omitted --> column, which ensured that it was an object of type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Number<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I tried making copies of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->List<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s used, at various points in the process, including using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ImmutableList<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ImmutableMap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google&rsquo;s Guava library<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in an attempt to prevent the value object of interest from being updated.  However, it wasn&rsquo;t possible to make them immutable deeply enough (and would probably have caused other problems if it had been).  That was largely because the principal <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is created and populated by Spring, so we don&rsquo;t have much control over it.</p>\n<p>One solution &ndash; and probably the proper one &ndash; would have been to copy the entries from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at the point they are read and processed in the webapp.  This would have meant that the edited, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->String<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, version of amount would be a different, new object, and would not have been updated in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that came from the cache.</p>\n<p>However, the vast complexity of the class where this would have had to happen made this seem like a very difficult and dangerous approach, especially at this late point in the project.</p>\n<p>An alternative solution was suggested by one of my colleagues.  It was to accept the fact that the amount value might be a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->String<!-- raw HTML omitted --> containing a numeric value with commas and decimal point, and to parse the numeric value out of it.</p>\n<p>This allowed us to cater for both numeric and string values, and it worked with either form of passing semantics.

The trigger this time was paging through the list of results; when you returned to a page you had already seen, you ended up with an object of the wrong kind coming out of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

There are too many possible places in in the relevant method to rely on finding them all, so I returned to the &ldquo;probably the proper&rdquo; solution mentioned above.  I changed the relevant method such that it now returns a copy of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->List<!-- raw HTML omitted --> containing the required subset of the query results.  This is less straightforward than might be hoped, because copying a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->List<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, including by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> method of the implementing class, for example, tends to do a &ldquo;shallow copy&rdquo;, which means that you get a new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->List<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instance, but containing references to the same objects.</p>\n<p>I wrote a method called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->copyList<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which iterates over a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->List<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and makes &ldquo;deep&rdquo; copies of a few expected types of object.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>This has been kicking around, nearly finished, for months.  It's not going to get any better, or shorter, so it's long past time I put it out there.\n\nIt's also just long; and technical.  So feel free to ignore.  I won't be offended.\n\nI rarely write about programming or other technical issues here, but I probably should do so more often.  Certainly in a case like this.\n\nI often think about the many, many problems that I've had help with from strangers on the internet; people who have taken the time to write blog posts, answers to questions on forums, or technology tutorials.  My job would barely be possible at times without the web.  Of course, we didn't have it back when I started in 1987; but we didn't do such complex things, with so many different languages and technologies.\n\nAnyway, all these kind strangers have helped me, and I rarely find myself in a position to give anything back to the community.  So since I recently hit a problem that no-one else seems to have had, it's really my duty to describe it, and my solution, in the hope that it might be of use to someone down the line.\n\nIf you're looking for the solution to the problem with pass-by reference on WAS, and don't want to read the story of how I got there, you can jump straight to <a href=\"#newbug\">The New Bug</a>\n\n</p><h2>Background</h2>\n\nWe develop our main app using a fairly standard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture\">n-tier</a> architecture using <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2ee/overview.html\">JEE</a>: web front end using JSPs and Struts; EJBs; a multiplicity of database platforms accessed using Spring.  All fairly standard stuff, whose purpose is to move financial messages around.\n\nA lot of this was originally developed when I wasn't around (I was seconded to another department) and by contractors and others who are no longer with us.  So I take no responsibility for the stupidities that exist in codebase.  Or rather, I accept no blame.  I do, in fact, have responsibility for it; for keeping it going and developing it onwards now.[^fn1]\n\nOne of the bad choices that was made by the original developers of this version of the product, was that they should cache the results of database queries.  The users can define various criteria by which they want to select a set of messages to view; those get translated into SQL, which our Java code executes using JDBC.  Again, all standard stuff.  JDBC was designed for exactly that kind of thing.  Databases exist solely to do that kind of thing.\n\nSo the wise and sensible developers decided that performance would be a problem if a query returned many rows from the database.  They decided that transferring the rows to the browser and allowing the user to scroll through them would be impossible.  So they designed a caching mechanism.\n\nThing is, JDBC has that kind of caching built right in.  And furthermore, they (our developers) included a limit: a maximum number of rows to return, which could be set to 50, 100, 500, or 1000.  Pretty reasonable, since any query that returned over 200 or so rows is likely to be less than useful, anyway.\n\nBut they still built that caching mechanism.\n\n<h2>The Mechanism</h2>\n\nThat's all right, though, I hear you say.  Cache the rows server-side in memory, return a subset to the user as they page through them.  It sounds fine.\n\nTrue enough.  Except they didn't cache them in memory.  Oh no.  That would have been too sensible.  And might have caused performance problems (I'm sure they thought, if they even considered they matter).  No, they cached them elsewhere.  Where?  In the database.\n\nYes, they introduced another table; a shadow table; an almost-identical duplicate of the <code>Messages</code> table, called <code>MessageQueryResults</code>.  Executing a query then consisted of selecting the required rows and writing them into this table, keyed by the HTTP session ID; and then re-querying this results table to get a page worth of results.\n\nSo, to recap, then: to improve performance (<a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization\">without first determining that there was actually a problem</a>), they replaced a simple database read with a read, a set of writes, and another set of reads.\n\nThat was <em>bound</em> to perform better, right?\n\n<h2>The Failure</h2>\n\nIt wasn't performance that brought this flimsy edifice crashing down, though.[^fn2] No, it actually ran quite successfully for several years.  Three things brought about its end: Microsoft, multiplicity, and me.[^fn3]\n\nMicrosoft's part was through their database platform, SQL Server.  Between one version and another they changed something about their storage mechanism, so that you could no longer rely on rows on a table being in the sequence in which they were written to the table.  The thing is, you're not <em>supposed</em> to be able to rely on that, according to DB theory.  That was another flaw in the \"design\" above; it relied on the shadow table's rows being returned in the same sequence they were written in.  On Oracle and DB2 that worked; and it did on SQL Server too, until (if memory serves) the 2005 version.  This meant that clients on that platform who had large queries couldn't rely on them being displayed in the right order.\n\nOh dear.\n\nHacks were applied to sort this out.  Pun intended: sorting is pretty much what they did.  Not a fix, but a workaround at best.\n\nThe multiplicity part was that the same mechanism was used to query another table; and then a third.  And there was a fourth on the horizon.  Each new table meant a new shadow table which had to be maintained in parallel -- and whose creation and upgrade scripts had to be maintained across three database platforms.  A maintenance nightmare.\n\nThen there was me.  I had known about the problem for some time, of course -- I had done an estimate for fixing it -- but there was never time to fix it.  It was a big task, quite intrusive, and showing no easily-provable customer benefit.  Yes, I know ease of maintenance, by making life easier for developers, is an implicit customer benefit; but try selling that to management, when there are customers crying out for new features.\n\nBut in the project that was to introduce the fourth table (or seventh and eighth, you might say) I was in a position to say, \"we fix this first, or it all goes to hell\".\n\nThe user story was written.  I got my estimate out of hibernation (and increased it, of course).  And then I did the fix.  It was a great joy.  That in-memory caching mechanism I mentioned above?  I did that.

As soon as it was turned on, we noticed that taking certain actions, such as deleting a message, failed.\n\nThe failure was at a point in the code where the a value such as an amount was being retrieved from the <code>Map</code> that formed the new cache.  The failure was that the retrieved <code>Object</code> was being cast to a <code>Number</code>, but what was in the <code>Map</code> entry was actually a <code>String</code>.\n\nThis <code>Map</code> comes, by a fairly complex set of steps, from the new cache, and before that from the database itself, of course.\n\nNow, since the <code>Amount</code> column on the DB is numeric, and the <code>Map</code> in question is originally populated via Spring from the DB, obviously the value was a numeric one originally.

Try that on Bing at the moment and you get a whole pile of other Martin McCallions.[^fn1] The worst part to me is that the first six are Facebook or LinkedIn profiles (the seventh is one of those annoying directory sites, then you get me).\n\nI wouldn't mind other people with the same name appearing above me, if it was their proper sites; but to me social-network profiles feel like distinctly second-class web entities.\n\nOr is that snobbish?</p></body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: As an experiment, and to ensure a like-for-like comparison, I signed out of Google, and went to the .com version (I normally use .co.uk by default).

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>That&rsquo;s hardcore in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->punk sense<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not rap, or anything else.  All genres have a &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo; subgenre, it seems.  I&rsquo;m sure that somewhere there&rsquo;s hardcore pop.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this album causes me to put together three words that I never thought I&rsquo;d see in the same sentence, never mind describing the same thing: punk rock opera.</p>\n<p>I know, I know, rock operas are the bloated detritus of prog rock, and part of what we fought the punk wars against.  Though truth be told, I&rsquo;ve always been quite fond of <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tommy<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  But in a sense it was always something that was going to happen eventually.  When a genre or a medium has been around for a while, people will try to take it further than it has gone before, and that&rsquo;s no bad thing.</p>\n<p>And when you get right down to it, it&rsquo;s all about storytelling, and who can complain about that?</p>\n<p>So I was pointed in the direction of this album by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a post on Mike Sizemore&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Sizemore is a scriptwriter; I probably started reading his blog when someone like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Warren Ellis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pointed me at a teaser or &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->sizzle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; video he and some other people made for a prospective science fiction series.</p>\n<p>Anyway, he posted a link to the video for the second track off the album, &lsquo;Queen of Hearts&rsquo;, and spoke very highly of it, as you&rsquo;ll have seen if you followed the link.  If you haven&rsquo;t, you should.  Go on, I&rsquo;ll wait.  I watched it a couple of times, and though, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK, interesting premise, I wish I could make out the words.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And then I forget about it for a while.</p>\n<p>But one day something made me go back.  I listened again.  I downloaded the album.  I fell in&hellip; not love, exactly, but fascination.</p>\n<p>North American hardcore bands have a certain vocal style, which is certainly not to everyone&rsquo;s taste.  In that way, I realised, it&rsquo;s not unlike actual opera.  Sure, the vocal stylings are about as far apart as possible; but they are both very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stylised<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  And my biggest two problems with opera are that it&rsquo;s hard to make the words out (even when they&rsquo;re singing in english), and that I don&rsquo;t really like the vocal stylings.</p>\n<p>Not to everyone&rsquo;s taste, as I said.</p>\n<p>Luckily, operas tend to have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->surtitles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; and albums have lyric sheets.  The lyrics for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Comes to Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->available on the web<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as you might expect.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m writing about this now because I haven&rsquo;t got round to doing so before, but especially because I&rsquo;ve just got back from seeing Fucked Up live.  They were playing at a Shoreditch venue called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XOYO<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a &ldquo;co-headliner&rdquo; with a band called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OFF!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I tweeted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a lot about it, and among other things, I expressed a degree of concern as to what it would be like going to a hardcore gig:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Hmm.  Not seen a hardcore gig since <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Napalm Death<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?  That may well be true, but they&rsquo;re British (and technically grindcore, according to Wikipedia).  I began to wonder whether I&rsquo;d <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ever<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seen a US (or Canadian) hardcore band live.  The only one I could think of were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hüsker Dü<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, whom I saw in Edinburgh in &ndash; oh, 84 or 85.</p>\n<p>I feel sure there must have been others, and yet the only such band that I was really, really a fan of was the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dead Kennedys<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and if they ever played the UK it happened either without me knowing about it, or they only played far away from where I was, or both.</p>\n<p>I needn&rsquo;t have worried, though.  The venue was just the right size, and comfortably packed.  The crowd were gentle and lovely.  The moshpit was pretty wild, but I turned 47 yesterday, which is officially way past too old for the moshpit, and I was well able to stay clear of it.</p>\n<p>And it was a totally brilliant night.  The first band, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cerebral Ballzy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, were on when I arrived, so I heard three or four of their songs.  They sounded pretty good, and more to the point, the sound in the room was excellent.  Clear, and powerful, without being so loud as to be overwhelming.</p>\n<p>OFF! were classic hardcore, in that if you didn&rsquo;t like a song there&rsquo;d be another along in way less than three minutes.  I thoroughly enjoyed them.</p>\n<p>And Fucked Up just ruled.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>For the last two months or so, it seems, I've been listening almost exclusively to a single album.[^fn1] That album is <a href=\"http://www.davidcomestolife.com/\"><cite>David Comes to Life</cite></a> by a Toronto hardcore band called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucked_Up\">Fucked Up</a>.\n\nThat's hardcore in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk\">punk sense</a>, not rap, or anything else.  All genres have a \"hardcore\" subgenre, it seems.  I'm sure that somewhere there's hardcore pop.\n\nAnyway, this album causes me to put together three words that I never thought I'd see in the same sentence, never mind describing the same thing: punk rock opera.\n\nI know, I know, rock operas are the bloated detritus of prog rock, and part of what we fought the punk wars against.  Though truth be told, I've always been quite fond of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(album)\"><cite>Tommy</cite></a>.  But in a sense it was always something that was going to happen eventually.  When a genre or a medium has been around for a while, people will try to take it further than it has gone before, and that's no bad thing.\n\nAnd when you get right down to it, it's all about storytelling, and who can complain about that?\n\nSo I was pointed in the direction of this album by <a href=\"http://www.sizemore.co.uk/2011/06/23/hello-my-name-is-david/\">a post on Mike Sizemore's blog</a>.  Sizemore is a scriptwriter; I probably started reading his blog when someone like <a href=\"http://www.warrenellis.com/\">Warren Ellis</a> pointed me at a teaser or \"<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/7963572\">sizzle</a>\" video he and some other people made for a prospective science fiction series.\n\nAnyway, he posted a link to the video for the second track off the album, 'Queen of Hearts', and spoke very highly of it, as you'll have seen if you followed the link.  If you haven't, you should.  Go on, I'll wait.  I watched it a couple of times, and though, \"That's OK, interesting premise, I wish I could make out the words.\"\n\nAnd then I forget about it for a while.\n\nBut one day something made me go back.  I listened again.  I downloaded the album.  I fell in... not love, exactly, but fascination.\n\nNorth American hardcore bands have a certain vocal style, which is certainly not to everyone's taste.  In that way, I realised, it's not unlike actual opera.  Sure, the vocal stylings are about as far apart as possible; but they are both very <em>stylised</em>.  And my biggest two problems with opera are that it's hard to make the words out (even when they're singing in english), and that I don't really like the vocal stylings.\n\nNot to everyone's taste, as I said.\n\nLuckily, operas tend to have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surtitles\">surtitles</a>; and albums have lyric sheets.  The lyrics for <cite>David Comes to Life</cite> are <a href=\"http://www.davidcomestolife.com/\">available on the web</a>, as you might expect.\n\nAnyway, I'm writing about this now because I haven't got round to doing so before, but especially because I've just got back from seeing Fucked Up live.  They were playing at a Shoreditch venue called <a href=\"http://www.xoyo.co.uk/\">XOYO</a> in a \"co-headliner\" with a band called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off!_%28band%29\">OFF!</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/devilgate\">I tweeted</a> a lot about it, and among other things, I expressed a degree of concern as to what it would be like going to a hardcore gig:\n\n<!-- http://twitter.com/devilgate/status/106636863355363330 --> <style type=\"text/css\">.bbpBox{background:url(http://a1.twimg.com/images/themes/theme5/bg.gif) #352726;padding:20px;}</style>\n\n</p><div id=\"tweet_106636863355363330\" class=\"bbpBox\" style=\"background:url(http://a1.twimg.com/images/themes/theme5/bg.gif) #352726;padding:20px;\"><p class=\"bbpTweet\" style=\"background:#fff;padding:10px 12px 10px 12px;margin:0;min-height:48px;color:#000;font-size:16px !important;line-height:22px;-moz-border-radius:5px;-webkit-border-radius:5px;\">Going to see Fucked Up and OFF! tonight.

Not seen a hardcore gig since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napalm_Death\">Napalm Death</a>?  That may well be true, but they're British (and technically grindcore, according to Wikipedia).  I began to wonder whether I'd <em>ever</em> seen a US (or Canadian) hardcore band live.  The only one I could think of were <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC\">Hüsker Dü</a>, whom I saw in Edinburgh in -- oh, 84 or 85.\n\nI feel sure there must have been others, and yet the only such band that I was really, really a fan of was the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Kennedys\">Dead Kennedys</a>, and if they ever played the UK it happened either without me knowing about it, or they only played far away from where I was, or both.\n\nI needn't have worried, though.  The venue was just the right size, and comfortably packed.  The crowd were gentle and lovely.  The moshpit was pretty wild, but I turned 47 yesterday, which is officially way past too old for the moshpit, and I was well able to stay clear of it.\n\nAnd it was a totally brilliant night.  The first band, <a href=\"http://cerebralballzy.com/\">Cerebral Ballzy</a>, were on when I arrived, so I heard three or four of their songs.  They sounded pretty good, and more to the point, the sound in the room was excellent.  Clear, and powerful, without being so loud as to be overwhelming.\n\nOFF! were classic hardcore, in that if you didn't like a song there'd be another along in way less than three minutes.  I thoroughly enjoyed them.\n\nAnd Fucked Up just ruled.  I was thinking before they came on that I would leave happy as long as they played 'Queen of Hearts'  And they duly opened with it!  They then proceeded to play edited highlights from <cite>David Comes to Life</cite>, interspersed with a few other tracks.  There was stage-diving, crowd-surfing, the singer diving topless into the audience and walking almost to the back of the venue while still singing (and using a wired mike, with a very long cable).\n\nAnyway, if you've read to the end of this rambling thing, you should go and listen to some things.  Here's the 'Queen of Hearts' video, and it's the first time I've ever embedded a video.  Let's hope it works.  Note that this version has the kids in the video singing on it, which is not how it is on the album, but is very cool nonetheless.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/syg6XGbdUkM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAnd the second video from the album, 'The Other Shoe', which they also did tonight.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mW0-jrDeSgQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: Though in old-school terms it would almost certainly be a double album.\n",

There was a page which said (and still does, a the time of writing), &lsquo;<a href=\"http://londonfeis.com/event-info/\">Band and Stage Times: To be released on the day</a>&rsquo;.  I had taken that to mean, &lsquo;&hellip; will be announced on the website on the day&rsquo;.  I did wonder about how much use that would be, considering many people would be getting on their way early in the morning, or the night before, and wouldn&rsquo;t have had the chance to look at the website.  Then again, everyone has a smartphone nowadays, right?</p>\n<p>Anyway, it turned out that they meant, &hellip;. will be released at the festival.'  On the bus to Finsbury Park I searched Twitter for the expected #feis hashtag, wherein some nice person had tweeted pictures of the running order (I can&rsquo;t find those pictures now, but no matter).  It appeared we were missing The Undertones, but we would get there in time for The Waterboys.</p>\n<p>As indeed we did.  We set up base camp near the back and listened to &lsquo;Be My Enemy&rsquo; (timely, as I recently read Christopher Brookmyre&rsquo;s novel which borrows that title) &lsquo;Fisherman&rsquo;s Blues&rsquo;, &lsquo;&hellip; And a Bang on the Ear&rsquo;, and of course, &lsquo;The Whole of the Moon&rsquo;.  It was great to see them again.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>The Saturday before last we went to the [London Feis Festival 2011](http://londonfeis.com/), in Finsbury Park.  The weather was looking to be quite bad as we set out: it had been oscillating between sun and rain all morning.  Would we be drenched or sunburned?  Or both?  Only time would tell.\n\nI had been hitting the festival website to try to find out who was on when, exactly.  There was a page which said (and still does, a the time of writing), '[Band and Stage Times: To be released on the day](http://londonfeis.com/event-info/)'.  I had taken that to mean, '... will be announced on the website on the day'.  I did wonder about how much use that would be, considering many people would be getting on their way early in the morning, or the night before, and wouldn't have had the chance to look at the website.  Then again, everyone has a smartphone nowadays, right?\n\nAnyway, it turned out that they meant, .... will be released at the festival.'  On the bus to Finsbury Park I searched Twitter for the expected #feis hashtag, wherein some nice person had tweeted pictures of the running order (I can't find those pictures now, but no matter).  It appeared we were missing The Undertones, but we would get there in time for The Waterboys.\n\nAs indeed we did.  We set up base camp near the back and listened to 'Be My Enemy' (timely, as I recently read Christopher Brookmyre's novel which borrows that title) 'Fisherman's Blues', '... And a Bang on the Ear', and of course, 'The Whole of the Moon'.  It was great to see them again.  Well, hear them; we didn't see much from the back, and there were no big screens like at most festivals these days.\n\nA trip to the second stage saw us Nanci Griffith, closely followed by Shane McGowan.  Always good to see he's still hanging in there, and he was in excellent voice.  I note that it's an alarming four and half years since I [last saw The Pogues](http://devilgate.org/blog/2006/01/06/the-rocky-pogue-to-brixton/).\n\n<img src=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_4775.jpg\" alt=\"Shane McGowan at the London Feis, 2011\" title=\"Shane McGowan at the London Feis, 2011\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" style=\"float:left;\">\n\n<br>\n\nHeard a bit of The Cranberries while queueing for toilet and bar.

Here we were, then, finally in the distant presence of the great man himself.\n\nAnd it was, as I expected, like listening to him doing cover versions of his own songs.

I had gained the impression that he mainly did newer songs these days, but there was a strong focus on <cite>Blood on the Tracks</cite> and <cite>Highway 61 Revisited</cite>.

[Here's a full set list](http://www.examiner.com/bob-dylan-in-national/bob-dylan-set-list-london-feis-2011-finsbury-park-june-18-2011).\n\nThe only possible singalong moment was the 'How does it feel?' lines in 'Like Rolling Stone', and it made me wonder: maybe he started doing such changed versions of his songs because he doesn't like people singing along.\n\nI thought this stall would do roaring trade, but the rain mostly stayed off.\n\n<img src=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_4740.jpg\" alt=\"Umbrella stall at the London Feis, 2011\" title=\"Umbrella stall at the London Feis, 2011\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" style=\"float:left;\">\n\n<br>\n\nThen Sunday was [Out of this World](http://www.bl.uk/sciencefiction), the Science Fiction thing at the British Library.  'Science Fiction, but not as you know it', was the tag line.  In fact, it was pretty much exactly as i know it, but I guess I'm part of some sort of rarefied elite, or something (or 'fans' as we're known).\n\nAnyway, it was very good, though perhaps it's limiting, being a library: much of the exhibition was books behind glass.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>This morning I heard John Humphrys haul the Prime Minister over the coals regarding the behaviour of the “No to AV” campaign.  Cameron tried to separate the “Conservative No” campaign from the rest of the No campaign, while failing to condemn the outright lies told by the broader campaign.  It was a remarkable piece of squirming, and decidedly unconvincing.</p>\n<p>He then went on to use the “one person one vote” argument.  This asserts that under AV, some people’s votes are counted more than once.  It ignores the fact that <em>every</em> voter can specify a list of preferences, of course, but it also seems to take an over-literal interpretation of the word “count”.  True, if my first preference is eliminated (under AV), my second preference is counted, which means that in some sense my ballot paper (or the entries on it) must be counted again; but ultimately the preferences I state are only applied towards one candidate.  My paper only “counts” towards one person.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, consider it a minor redefinition of what a “vote” is.  Instead of meaning a single “X” placed in a single box, it means a set of one or more preferences specified on a ballot paper.  “One person, one paper,” you could say.</p>\n<p>And last night I heard a “Referendum Broadcast” by the No campaign.  It was incredibly stupid, too; and again by being over-literal.  It analogised an AV-based election as a horse race, in which horse A came first, but the victory was awarded to third-placed horse C.  Everyone was very confused.  Because AV is so complex that nobody can understand it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/kk2lZ.jpg\">Here’s a picture</a> that shows the complexities of the two systems.</p>\n<p>Come on, say “Yes” on Thursday.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Congratulations to her, and all.</p>\n<p>I just finished reading her <cite>Moxyland</cite>, which I was given at last year’s Eastercon, and… I’m not so impressed.</p>\n<p><cite>Strange Horizons</cite> has a good <a href=\"http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2009/11/two_views_moxyl.shtml\">dual review</a> of it.  I <em>kind of</em> enjoyed it, especially towards the end.  But in many ways I found it annoying, and I’ve been trying to work out exactly why that is.</p>\n<p>Part of it is the characters, I think.  I don’t mind unsympathetic — even unpleasant — characters.  But I think the main problem with these ones is that it’s hard to tell their voices apart, and since the story is told from multiple first-person viewpoints, that’s a problem.</p>\n<p>But I think the biggest point of disconnection for me was technological: there is one particular item that made my disbelief-suspension system collapse in despair.</p>\n<p>Because I can easily believe in a near future where your phone takes the place of both credit cards and cash, where it is the heart and soul of your identity, and to be disconnected would make you an unperson.  But even supposing that phones could be engineered to give their owners a taser-like shock at the command of any police officer (what if your battery is low?); even supposing that a society would not rise up in protest at the madness of a government requiring its citizens to possess such a thing; and even supposing that it all worked: I <em>can’t</em> believe that nobody would carry them in thick rubber pockets.</p>\n<p>So in the end, in a novel containing much about political activism, it’s the political acquiescence of its imagined society that crashed me out of the story too often.</p>\n<p>Still, it was her first novel, and shows much promise, so I expect that <cite>Zoo City</cite> will be a worthy winner.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It is in the sense that, if I want to get the albums I lost, I’ll have to buy them again, so the artists get paid again.

The song is, apparently, ‘<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5yQNpgeR8E\">You Overdid it Doll</a>‘ by The Courteeners.</p>\n<p>It’s kind of disappointing to know the truth.  I’m listening to it as I type, and I can’t hear it saying “you own a tank-top” any more.  Still, it has entered family lore, and will always be known that way to us.</p>\n<p>In the interests of full disclosure, I should note that I once owned a tank-top.  In my defence, it was the seventies, and I was seven.<br>\n<a href=\"http://petsoundsthemasterplan.wordpress.com/\"><br>\nAlso, my nephew, Paul, who is travelling around Australia and other far-off places</a>, and blogging about it, once tried to introduce me to The Courteeners.

I kept thinking, &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.

I absolutely loved every minute of it (except, perhaps, the long detour over the pole).  And the unusual thing about is this: it made me think, \"Come on, get the action out of the way, and get back to the talking and philosophy.\"\n\nI won't go in to any detail.  There are plenty of places you can <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAnathem&amp;ei=F7WGTP-FIpS24gbVxZHSBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXlIGBkRFCvrFr-IeMPAsptCHoOA&amp;sig2=891vnPdWHYksIPHQLSDFVw\">read more about it</a>.  A wonderful, wonderful book.\n\n<h2><cite>The Time-Traveller's Wife</cite> by Audrey Niffenegger</h2>\n\nAs is this one.  There has been a lot written about this, too.  I, of course, approached it with genre in mind, and was amused from the start by the review-quotes on the cover; notably The Observer's assertion that it is \"startlingly original\".\n\nIt's about someone who randomly travels in time along their own timeline.   I kept thinking, \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five\">Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.</a>\".  I kept thinking, \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%94All_You_Zombies%E2%80%94\">I know where I came from, but what about all you zombies?</a>\" (which quote I misremembered; it is actually \"<a href=\"http://ieng9.ucsd.edu/~mfedder/zombies.html\">...but where did all you zombies come from?</a>\")\n\nI even thought, \"Spoilers,\" and \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Song_%28Doctor_Who%29\">Hello Sweetie.</a>\", but a quick check of the publication date informs me that it actually pre-dates new <cite>Doctor Who</cite>, so maybe Moffat was influenced by this.\n\nAnyway, all those touchpoints are largely irrelevant, as this is not a work of science fiction at all (it makes no attempt to explain the time-travel mechanism, though does assign it some genetic connection).  It is, rather, a love story with slightly unusual constraints.  And very well told, though I'm a tad unhappy with the ending.\n\n<h2><cite>The Night Sessions</cite> by Ken MacLeod</h2>\n\nAs I am with the ending of this one.  It's a fine story, though, set in a future Edinburgh where global warming has been partially turned back by technology, and there are space elevators and fully-conscious robots and other AIs.  It's a crime story, with the main character being a cop.\n\nEdinburgh's SF writers seem to be trying to get a bit of Iain Rankine's territory these days.\n\n<h2><cite>The Clan Corporate</cite> by Charles Stross</h2>\n\nCharlie being the other of those I'm alluding to there.  Here, though, we're back in his \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross#Merchant_Princes_series\">Merchant Princes</a> series.  I've reviewed the <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2007/04/12/book-notes-25-the-family-trade-by-charles-stross/\">first</a> and <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/03/16/the-hidden-family-by-charles-stross-books-2008-2/\">second</a> volumes before.\n\nI said before that it was hard to believe how successful Miriam Beckstein is, given the radical changes that have happened to her.  In this one she is much more circumscribed, by her odd family.\n\nRelatively little happens here, really, but a lot is set in place for the following volumes.  The main thing is that her worlds are starting to collide.\n\n<h2><cite>Pandaemonium</cite> by Christopher Brookmyre</h2>\n\nWorlds colliding here, too.\n\nI haven't read a Brookmyre since his first, <cite>Quite Ugly One Morning</cite>, which I remember thoroughly enjoying.  Not enough, though, to read any intervening ones.\n\nThis one is very different.  It has soldiers, scientists, priests, demons, and schoolkids.

This year the British National Science Fiction Convention was practically on our doorstep, just the other side of London, at Heathrow.\n\nAs with [two years ago][easter2008], my son wanted to come.  And since my daughter did as well, my beloved bit the bullet and came along too.  SF isn't totally her thing, but I think she may have enjoyed the weekend more than any of us.\n\n[easter2008]: http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/04/03/that-reporting-back-from-eastercon-business/ \"Eastercon 2008\"\n\nThe telling detail was this: there are lots of things to do.\n\nI tend to use cons as a way of seeing friends that I haven't seen for a while -- often not since the last con I was at.  So I mainly hang out in the bar.  Or that, at least, is the impression I gave -- give -- to people who don't go to cons.\n\nIn fact, I have always gone to programme items.  I guess I just never made a big thing of them when I got home.\n\nThis con -- [Odyssey 2010][odyssey2010] -- had a particularly good set of programme items for kids.  There were hands-on science workshops, making Dalek cakes, and building string-propelled robots (my son won a prize for the best ramp-mounting attempt).

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>The new Iain Banks book, <cite>Transition</cite>, is a science fiction novel. This is despite the fact that it is not published as by Iain <em>M</em> Banks.\n\nAnd I don't mean the slightly-ambiguous, could-be-a-dream-or-somebody's-madness-if-you-don't-want-to-suspend-your-disbelief sort of thing you get in <cite>The Bridge</cite> Or <cite>Walking On Glass</cite>, either.  This is out-and-out SF, no  queries or discussion.  It is a tale of parallel universes, of an infinity of alternative Earths, and of people who can move between them, using a combination of drugs and native ability.\n\nAnd it's that ability that holds both one of the novel's unanswered moral questions, and its biggest flaw.\n\nWhen adepts transition between the worlds, they do so in mind only.  That is, their mind occupies - possesses - the body of someone who already exists on the target parallel.\n\nEthically, this is a minefield, of course.  But that question is only vaguely touched on.\n\nOther ethical issues are addressed, notably the use of torture by states.  There is passing character - just a walk-on, really - of a policeman who once tortured a terrorist suspect and had some success.  He was tortured in turn by his guilt for the rest of his life.\n\nThe big flaw, though, concerns the transition mechanism and its use, and to talk about it, I'll have to include some minor spoilers.  So, you know: you have been warned.\n\nAs I said, flitting between the parallel universes involves the mind, the personality of the transitionary jumping into the body of someone already existing on the target parallel.  This applies even when someone takes a 'passenger' along, which some can do.  Each of them takes over a body in the new world.\n\nBut sometimes Banks has characters jumping to places where there really <em>couldn't</em> be a body for them to take over (versions of the Earth that are uninhabited, for example).  Yet they seem to jump successfully.\n\nI don't mind there being a 'bodiless' and a 'bodiful' version of the ability, for example: but it does need to be explained, or at least mentioned.  I can hardly believe that nobody picked this up in the revision and editing process.\n\nThat aside, though, it's damn fine, and probably his best 'non-M' for quite a few years.\n\nWith the secret cabal that is trying to run the world(s) behind the scenes, it is sort of <cite>The Business 2.0</cite>.  Or maybe 10.0.</p></body></html>\n",

				"title": "Identity and letdown in The Raw Shark Texts, by Steven Hall (books 2008, 6)",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>He is attacked by a &lsquo;conceptual shark&rsquo;: a living, sentient creature that is composed of ideas, of thoughts, of words; and that swims in the sea of information that surrounds us.  This is the creature that took his memories.  It eats such information, and fixates on a victim, and will keep coming back to attack them again and again.</p>\n<p>So the messages from &ldquo;the first Eric Sanderson&rdquo; tell him.  Fortunately they also give him some tools and techniques to protect himself, and information about someone who might be able to help him.</p>\n<p>So eventually he sets out on a quest to find the mysterious Trey Fidorous.  That&rsquo;s as far as I&rsquo;m going to go with the plot summary (it covers probably a quarter of the book).</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting idea, that creatures composed of pure information, of ideas, can exist and can do us harm.  We&rsquo;re well into SF territory here, without wanting to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hegemonise<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and irrespective of the fact that it&rsquo;s marketed as mainstream literary fiction (why, I&rsquo;ve often wondered, don&rsquo;t people talk about &ldquo;li-fi&rdquo;, or &ldquo;cri-fi&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;hi-fi&rdquo;?  Why is SF so special that it gets its own disparaging abbreviation?)  There was real justification for including this work in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clarke Awards shortlist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (sadly I haven&rsquo;t read any of the others on the list).  We are plunged into a world of infinite strangeness and difference (even though it stands alongside the world we are familiar with).  We have to hang on for the ride and pick things up as we go along.  These are standard, recognised characteristics of much SF.</p>\n<p>Which may be neither here nor there, really; unless how we classify a work affects how we approach it, how we read it.  And I think it&rsquo;s true that it does: if you approach Iain Banks&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bridge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for example, as SF (it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;non-M&rsquo;, so it was marketed as mainstream), then you&rsquo;ll get quite a different effect from the scenes on the bridge, and with the barbarian; at least allowing for the possibility that those events actually happened in some sense, in some reality.  As opposed to the assumption that they were &lsquo;only&rsquo; the deranged fantasy of a mind in a coma, which is of course the only &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; reading.</p>\n<p>We are in a similar situation here.  Eric&rsquo;s psychiatrist thinks that he might be going into a fugue state; and clearly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has happened to his mind.  But Eric has experienced the attack of the Ludovician (the name of the particular type of conceptual fish that attacked him) and he believes throughout that what is happening is real.  And all through the quest, and the love story and the fight scenes, he believes it.  And so does the author, apparently.</p>\n<p>And so do we.</p>\n<p>Except.</p>\n<p>Except, except.</p>\n<p>Right on the second last page, Hall undermines it all.  After the narrative has finished there are a couple of pages of extra material before the &lsquo;undex&rsquo; (the point of which I&rsquo;m not sure about).</p>\n<p>The first of these pulls the rug out from under us, and dumps us more or less into &ldquo;he woke up and it was all a dream&rdquo; territory.  Or didn&rsquo;t wake up.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Eric Sanderson wakes without his memories.  In short order he starts receiving messages apparently sent by his former self, is told by his psychiatrist not to read any such messages, and starts reading them - in the wrong order, which leaves him unready for the trouble that is about to assail him.\n\nHe is attacked by a 'conceptual shark': a living, sentient creature that is composed of ideas, of thoughts, of words; and that swims in the sea of information that surrounds us.  This is the creature that took his memories.  It eats such information, and fixates on a victim, and will keep coming back to attack them again and again.\n\nSo the messages from \"the first Eric Sanderson\" tell him.  Fortunately they also give him some tools and techniques to protect himself, and information about someone who might be able to help him.\n\nSo eventually he sets out on a quest to find the mysterious Trey Fidorous.  That's as far as I'm going to go with the plot summary (it covers probably a quarter of the book).\n\nIt's an interesting idea, that creatures composed of pure information, of ideas, can exist and can do us harm.  We're well into SF territory here, without wanting to <a href=\"http://www.chrononaut.org/log/?p=295\">hegemonise</a>, and irrespective of the fact that it's marketed as mainstream literary fiction (why, I've often wondered, don't people talk about \"li-fi\", or \"cri-fi\", or even \"hi-fi\"?  Why is SF so special that it gets its own disparaging abbreviation?)  There was real justification for including this work in the <a href=\"http://www.clarkeaward.com/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=1%3Alatest-news&amp;id=79%3A2008+Shortlist+Announced&amp;tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;page=&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=50\">Clarke Awards shortlist</a> (sadly I haven't read any of the others on the list).  We are plunged into a world of infinite strangeness and difference (even though it stands alongside the world we are familiar with).  We have to hang on for the ride and pick things up as we go along.  These are standard, recognised characteristics of much SF.\n\nWhich may be neither here nor there, really; unless how we classify a work affects how we approach it, how we read it.  And I think it's true that it does: if you approach Iain Banks's <cite>The Bridge</cite>, for example, as SF (it's a 'non-M', so it was marketed as mainstream), then you'll get quite a different effect from the scenes on the bridge, and with the barbarian; at least allowing for the possibility that those events actually happened in some sense, in some reality.  As opposed to the assumption that they were 'only' the deranged fantasy of a mind in a coma, which is of course the only 'mainstream' reading.\n\nWe are in a similar situation here.  Eric's psychiatrist thinks that he might be going into a fugue state; and clearly <em>something</em> has happened to his mind.  But Eric has experienced the attack of the Ludovician (the name of the particular type of conceptual fish that attacked him) and he believes throughout that what is happening is real.  And all through the quest, and the love story and the fight scenes, he believes it.  And so does the author, apparently.\n\nAnd so do we.\n\nExcept.\n\nExcept, except.\n\nRight on the second last page, Hall undermines it all.  After the narrative has finished there are a couple of pages of extra material before the 'undex' (the point of which I'm not sure about).\n\nThe first of these pulls the rug out from under us, and dumps us more or less into \"he woke up and it was all a dream\" territory.  Or didn't wake up.  It's a bit like Sam Tyler at the  end of <cite>Life on Mars</cite>, except there it was more or less clearly stated all the way through that he was in a coma: you just didn't want it to be so.\n\nThe present work is less honest, in a way, since there really is no suggestion that what Eric is experiencing might not be 'real'.  Sure, it's always there as a possibility, but I'd have to say,\"What's the point?\", really.  Why would you bother to write a story that, in the internal logic of that story, all took place in the head of its protagonist, <em>and didn't do anything to help the protagonist</em>, or illuminate his life, or help him to come to terms with something?\n\nAs such, this is ultimately disappointing: it's a great ride, spoiled by the ending.\n\nAlthough, a further twist occurs to me, a couple of months after reading it.  If the rug-pulling element were <em>not</em> there, you could say, then we would have a fantasy-happy ending, like the fake ending in <cite>Brazil</cite>.  That's never a good thing, of course, but the difference remains this: in <cite>Brazil</cite>, the false ending was tacked on (or it would have been if the 'real' ending hadn't superseded it).  Here, the ending grows naturally out of all that has gone before.  If everything was in his imagination, then fine, so was the ending.

So I can only reiterate: get out and vote, and stop Boris.  Give at least your _second_ vote to Ken.  He has his faults, but he's done a pretty good job of running the city this last eight years.\n\nVote!\n\n</p></body></html>\n",

This applies in particular to the new academies.  Our closest, non-denominational, mixed-gender, state secondary, is Mossbourne, the much-cited flagship of the government&rsquo;s new academies programme.

Not a pass -or-fail test, of course: this is still a comprehensive school, so there&rsquo;s no selection by ability allowed.  Rather, this test is used to split the kids into ability bands.  The entry conditions then ensure that an equal proportion of kids from each band is offered a place.  This is to ensure that the school  has kids of a range of abilities; to ensure that it is truly comprehensive, if you will.</p>\n<p>None of that is inherently bad: a school can&rsquo;t take every kid, if more want in than it has places, so it has to have some conditions by which to decide which ones to take.

Well, across Hackney as a whole, but we happen to be in one of the more problematic corners, since we&rsquo;re right at the edge of the borough.  That wouldn&rsquo;t matter if the Hackney schools gave priority to Hackney kids, but they don&rsquo;t: their distance criteria are based on pure straight-line measurements, ignoring borough boundaries.</p>\n<p>Again, <em>that</em> wouldn&rsquo;t matter so much if all the other boroughs did the same.  But they don&rsquo;t.  Our neighbours Tower Hamlets, for example, not only give priority to Tower Hamlets residents, they also have tied primary schools.  If your kid goes to one of these, then they are <em>guaranteed</em> a place in the associated secondary school, if they (you) want it.</p>\n<p>But this is not intended to be a big bowl of sour grapes.  Our boy almost certainly won&rsquo;t get into any of the Hackney schools, but he should get into the next-nearest one, which is just over the border into Waltham Forest.  And all of this may be moot, anyway.  But more of that later.</p>\n<p>I referred in my title to &ldquo;the myth of choice&rdquo;, and I was careful to stress above that the application process allows parents and children to specify their <em>preferences</em>, rather than choices.  That&rsquo;s because of what happens next, after the application process has come up with a school for your kid.</p>\n<p>You get an offer.  One offer.  That&rsquo;s it.  (Or maybe none, in which you have to run around frantically making further applications.)</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not like it was when I applied to university (and probably still is for university applications today).  There, you could apply to five (or was it six?) institutions using the UCCA (now UCAS) form.  They all assessed your application, and up to <em>all</em> of them made you an offer.  You could then choose among your offers and decide  which place would suit you best.</p>\n<p>That was choice.  For secondary schools. despite what the government might tell you, there is no choice.  All you can do is state your preferences.</p>\n<p>Our particular dilemma had another wrinkle, though.</p>\n<p>See, he and some of his friends decided that they wanted to go to something called The Latymer School, in Edmonton.  I was surprised when I found out that this is a grammar school.  Now, some years ago I was surprised to discover that these things still exist in England.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that when the comprehensive system started in Scotland, it was done properly: we got rid of <em>all</em> the grammar schools and Secondary Moderns, as far as I understand it.  So as I say, it was a surprise when I realised they still had some in England.</p>\n<p>But even then, I thought they were restricted to Kent and a few other places.  I had no idea there were any in London.</p>\n<p>Still, there we were.  We weren&rsquo;t about to forbid him to look at a particular school, despite our natural left-wing reaction to the idea of a selective school.  Perhaps of more concern is that he would be going out of the borough, with both a long journey to get there, and a less ethnically diverse mix than he&rsquo;s used to from primary.</p>\n<p>When it came time to stating our preferences, we let him have the final word.  Which is a lot of weight to put on the shoulders of a ten-year-old, perhaps, but it&rsquo;s better than pressuring him into going somewhere he&rsquo;d rather not go, and driving him away from us.</p>\n<p>One thing I can say: selection by ability is obviously better than selection by ability to pay.</p>\n<p>And another: we&rsquo;ll be incredibly proud of him wherever he goes.</p>\n<p>He got through the first battery of tests, and took the second; and we&rsquo;ve been waiting since then.  And tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll know.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

That's because of what happens next, after the application process has come up with a school for your kid.\n\nYou get an offer.  One offer.  That's it.  (Or maybe none, in which you have to run around frantically making further applications.)\n\nIt's not like it was when I applied to university (and probably still is for university applications today).  There, you could apply to five (or was it six?) institutions using the UCCA (now UCAS) form.  They all assessed your application, and up to _all_ of them made you an offer.  You could then choose among your offers and decide  which place would suit you best.\n\nThat was choice.  For secondary schools. despite what the government might tell you, there is no choice.  All you can do is state your preferences.\n\nOur particular dilemma had another wrinkle, though.\n\nSee, he and some of his friends decided that they wanted to go to something called The Latymer School, in Edmonton.  I was surprised when I found out that this is a grammar school.  Now, some years ago I was surprised to discover that these things still exist in England.  I'm pretty sure that when the comprehensive system started in Scotland, it was done properly: we got rid of _all_ the grammar schools and Secondary Moderns, as far as I understand it.  So as I say, it was a surprise when I realised they still had some in England.\n\nBut even then, I thought they were restricted to Kent and a few other places.  I had no idea there were any in London.\n\nStill, there we were.  We weren't about to forbid him to look at a particular school, despite our natural left-wing reaction to the idea of a selective school.  Perhaps of more concern is that he would be going out of the borough, with both a long journey to get there, and a less ethnically diverse mix than he's used to from primary.\n\nWhen it came time to stating our preferences, we let him have the final word.  Which is a lot of weight to put on the shoulders of a ten-year-old, perhaps, but it's better than pressuring him into going somewhere he'd rather not go, and driving him away from us.\n\nOne thing I can say: selection by ability is obviously better than selection by ability to pay.\n\nAnd another: we'll be incredibly proud of him wherever he goes.\n\nHe got through the first battery of tests, and took the second; and we've been waiting since then.  And tomorrow, we'll know.\n\n</body></html>\n",

It was published in 1977, when I was 12 or 13.  So I expect I missed it because I was &lsquo;too old&rsquo; for children&rsquo;s books, and not yet old enough again for them.

All that I recalled was a complaint to the effect that in the book, the girl was supposed to be plain, even boyish-looking, while in the film she was Hollywood-pretty (if dressed a little unconventionally compared to her schoolmates).</p>\n<p>I think that review explains why my opinion of the film differs so significantly from that of most reviewers: they all seem to have read the book.  Inevitably they review the film in comparison to it, and fuelled by their knowledge of the plot.</p>\n<p>So they can describe it as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lsquo;bittersweet&rsquo;, as having an &lsquo;uplifting&rsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ending; even as &lsquo;transcendent&rsquo; (I think that last came from one of the mini-documentaries on the DVD).

The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Potters<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can get away with it, because so many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> read the books first.  But in general a film &ndash; or any adaptation from one medium to another &ndash; must work on its own.  It is a separate, new creation, and has to stand or fall as such.</p>\n<p>In one sense at least, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Terabithia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fails on this account.</p>\n<p>The trouble is not lack of coherence; rather it is excess of impact, and lack of recovery time.  There is certainly some foreshadowing: it is plain that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bad is going to happen.  But the  tragedy when it comes &ndash; and make no mistake, the story <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a tragedy &ndash; is too deep, too dark, too sudden.  Yes, true, that&rsquo;s how it would be in real life; and I&rsquo;m not suggesting that movie viewers, including children, should be completely protected from darkness, tragedy or loss.  But here, suddenly, shatteringly, we are no longer watching the film that we thought we were.</p>\n<p>Which is not necessarily a bad thing.  But the film&rsquo;s fatal flaw &ndash; or at least the cause of its failure to achieve the uplift suggested by reviewers &ndash; comes after the plunge into darkness.</p>\n<p>It is the lack of recovery time, and the content of what time there is.  Yes, a significant amount of time for the characters is compressed into a few swiftly-edited scenes.  Perhaps enough time is represented for the boy, Jess, to come to terms with his loss, or at least to begin to do so.  But it is not enough time for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do so.</p>\n<p>And perhaps because the fantasy elements were (rightly) understated earlier on, we have what feels like a tacked-on fantasy ending.  And it&rsquo;s not even the tacked-on fantasy ending we might want.  Me, I&rsquo;d have liked Jess, the talented artist, to to have ripped out the page of the film&rsquo;s continuity, said, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and sketched a new one.</p>\n<p>That, of course, would have made for a saccharine ending, like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->false ending<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brazil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or the original cut of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blade Runner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It would have been deemed a mistake (not least because of differing from the book), or at least have been very hard to make work.  It would have betrayed the story.</p>\n<p>But the ending that we do have betrays the story too, I think, in a different way.  The descent (ascent?) into fantasy may show that Jess had become closer to his little sister; but it writes Leslie out of his memories of Terabithia.  It ceases to be their magical place, and therefore fails to honour her memory.</p>\n<p>Of course it is all to help him to come to terms with his loss; but as his Dad tells him, it&rsquo;s by remembering what was special about her that he can keep her alive.</p>\n<p>Above all, though, it all happens too quickly: maybe we, the viewers, could have had just a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->little<!-- raw HTML omitted --> more time?</p>\n<p>I can only assume that the book does, in fact, provide a more gentle exit for its readers, for it to be so popular.  Though of course, you can take a book at your own pace.</p>\n<p>Yet despite &ndash; or more likely, because of &ndash; all of the above, it&rsquo;s a film that will stay with me for a long time; that I&rsquo;ll probably watch again; and whose source-book I&rsquo;ll certainly seek out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

Me, I'd have liked Jess, the talented artist, to to have ripped out the page of the film's continuity, said, \"No!\" and sketched a new one.\n\nThat, of course, would have made for a saccharine ending, like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_(film)#Scenes_missing_in_American_cut\">false ending</a> in <cite>Brazil</cite>, or the original cut of <cite>Blade Runner</cite>.  It would have been deemed a mistake (not least because of differing from the book), or at least have been very hard to make work.  It would have betrayed the story.\n\nBut the ending that we do have betrays the story too, I think, in a different way.  The descent (ascent?) into fantasy may show that Jess had become closer to his little sister; but it writes Leslie out of his memories of Terabithia.  It ceases to be their magical place, and therefore fails to honour her memory.\n\nOf course it is all to help him to come to terms with his loss; but as his Dad tells him, it's by remembering what was special about her that he can keep her alive.\n\nAbove all, though, it all happens too quickly: maybe we, the viewers, could have had just a <em>little</em> more time?\n\nI can only assume that the book does, in fact, provide a more gentle exit for its readers, for it to be so popular.  Though of course, you can take a book at your own pace.\n\nYet despite -- or more likely, because of -- all of the above, it's a film that will stay with me for a long time; that I'll probably watch again; and whose source-book I'll certainly seek out.</p></body></html>\n",

Blogging doesn’t <em>have</em> to be completely reactive.  Sometimes it should take the longer-term, contemplative view.  So I offer this.</p>\n<p>It seems obvious to me that, if your navy personnel are captured by the forces of a foreign power, in peacetime, and accused of being in the foreign power’s waters, then what you should do is as follows:<br>\nYou say, “Oops, sorry.  Didn’t mean to have them off station; didn’t think they were, actually, but if they were, we’re sorry.”  Even, and let me make this quite clear, if you know <em>perfectly well</em> that they weren’t in the other power’s territory.</p>\n<p>That, it seems to me, would be the <em>diplomatic</em> thing to do</p>\n<p>So why did they not do that?  My best guess is that they – the British government – were worried about losing face.</p>\n<p>‘Losing face.’  It’s a strange thing for the government of what is still a fairly major world power to be worrying about, isn’t it?  After all, it’s not as if making such a guarded admission and apology would actually have done Britain any harm, would it?</p>\n<p>And it might have got the captured service people home a few days earlier – and without being humiliated on TV – you never know.  Perhaps, even, the Iranian government would have apologised in their turn, and admitted that <em>they</em> might have made a mistake.</p>\n<p>That last seems almost likely, given that they did appear to concede quite graciously in the end.  But what do I know?  I’m neither diplomat nor politician, and there might be some way in which doing what I suggested right from the start would have been political suicide.  And obviously things will have been going on in the background of which we know nothing.  But still…</p>\n<p>And then they get home and tell their stories.  I seem to be the only person in the country who thinks like this, but I see no reason why they shouldn’t be allowed to profit from doing so.  <em>Somebody</em> is going to profit from the stories being told, so why shouldn’t it be the ones to whom they happened?</p>\n<p>Sure, if it’s against the rules of the service, then that’s the deal they signed up for.  But since the Ministry of Defence authorised it, then at the very least, I  don’t see how you can blame the sailors.</p>\n<p>I speak as someone who likes to write; so if I imagine myself into a situation like that, I know I would want to write my story once I had escaped.  And if I could go on to sell it for professional publication, then you’re damn right I would want to do so.  Why not?</p>\n<p>The reported reactions of some of the families of service personnel who have died in Iraq is, to my mind, a red herring.  There’s no direct comparison.  As far as I know, there’s nothing to stop those families from writing, telling, or selling their own stories, or those of their lost ones.  If they choose not to, that’s fine.

Until Andrew told me about the event, I didn't even know that the publication existed.\n\nIt was a good night. I missed the first reading, by Anna Feruglio Dal Dan, but heard various drabbles, Andrew's story, and two other fine stories.\n\nDuring the interval I picked up the back issues of the magazine and took out a subscription. Then at the end we helped the Editor, <a href=\"http://www.wendybradley.com/\">Wendy Bradley</a>, to carry some boxes back to her flat, and drank her whisky.\n\nAll in all, it was a fine night.</p></body></html>\n",

It makes you sick; though it shouldn’t.</p>\n<p>Horatio Lyle is a scientist and investigator in Victorian times.  He has a dog called Tate, but there’s a lot more to this book than bad sugar-manufacturer-related jokes.  The blurb describes it as “Sherlock Holmes crossed with Thomas Edison as written by Terry Pratchett”, and that’s not a bad assessment; though it’s not as funny as Pratchett.  I read it with my nine-year-old son, and he thoroughly enjoyed it: though not so much the descriptive passages, and he was disappointed by the ending.</p>\n<p>I thought the descriptive passages were very well written and incredibly evocative, but there were rather too many of them; and while I enjoyed it at the time, actually the action was on the weak side, and she didn’t make as much of the plot as she could have.</p>\n<p>And that ending: what a letdown.  See, the story is that this ancient plate of great cultural significance has been stolen from the Bank of England, and various groups are trying to get it back.</p>\n<p>It turns out that one of the groups consists of some sort of supernatural beings.  They are a bit vampirish, but they have the traditional fear of, and vulnerability to, iron, of Faerie.  They believe the plate has great power.</p>\n<p>There are investigations and plots; but not really very many of them.  It’s very well written, as I say, but kind of lightweight.</p>\n<p>I see that there’s a sequel out already, so in time we might see whether her plotting skills have got any stronger.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

The only things that have changed in security terms compared with a few months ago are the prohibited items in hand baggage, and the enforcement of the &ldquo;only one item&rdquo; rule (I&rsquo;m sure this has been the rule for decades, but it just wasn&rsquo;t strictly enforced).  Both of those issues should be dealt with at checkin, so when you get to the security gates you should be ready.  Every bag and coat is x-rayed, as before: but there should be fewer bags; everyone goes through a metal detector, just as they always did.  There was a &ldquo;please take off your shoes&rdquo; section after the metal detectors, but as we paused at it, one security guy called, &ldquo;Not everybody, not everybody,&rdquo; and waved us on.  I suppose people were randomly chosen, and incidentally, everyone I saw taking their shoes off was white.  This may, of course, just mean that people who look like terrorists (whatever that may mean) are not travelling, from fear of being hassled.</p>\n<p>I conclude that the only reason for the giant queues must be stupidity: there must be people who, even though they are asked about prohibited items at checkin, and even though this stuff has been in the news for weeks, still have drinks in their hand luggage, and then have to stop to abandon them at security.  Or who try to take more than one item on, even though they&rsquo;ve been told not to.  And yet, I didn&rsquo;t see much of that happening.  I really don&rsquo;t understand why the queues got so big.  There were plenty of security staff on duty, too.</p>\n<p>Coming back, things were much less fraught at Glasgow Airport, as they generally are at smaller airports, in my experience.</p>\n<p>Throughout, I have to say, all the security staff we encountered were cheerful, polite, and helpful, while doing a largely thankless, probably quite dull, job, filled with seemingly-arbitrary rule changes handed down from above.  I can&rsquo;t really fault them, no matter how daft some of the things they have to enforce may be.</p>\n<p>A last thought: we are being conditioned to accept travelling with photo ID, even within the country.  It was strange to see everyone queuing up to get onto a flight to Scotland, with their passports ready.  Now I&rsquo;d be quite happy to see EU passports issued by the Republic of Scotland (as long as it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a republic), but for now, it was still a journey within the UK.</p>\n<p>And the strange thing is, it seems to be the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->airlines<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are driving this, not the authorities.  I have had to show photo ID on RyanAir and EasyJet, but a few months ago &ndash; this year, certainly &ndash; I flew to Scotland with BMI Baby, and not only did they not ask for ID, but I didn&rsquo;t even have to see a human to check in: hand baggage, a credit card, and a self-checkin machine, and there I was.  That was before all the recent fuss, true, but RyanAir (and possibly EasyJet) have been asking for ID for years.  Are they secretly being used by the government to get us used to carrying ID cards?  And if so, why is it only some airlines?</p>\n<p>Or am I being unreasonably paranoid?  &lsquo;Cos I only want to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reasonably<!-- raw HTML omitted --> paranoid, you know.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

Every bag and coat is x-rayed, as before: but there should be fewer bags; everyone goes through a metal detector, just as they always did.  There was a \"please take off your shoes\" section after the metal detectors, but as we paused at it, one security guy called, \"Not everybody, not everybody,\" and waved us on.  I suppose people were randomly chosen, and incidentally, everyone I saw taking their shoes off was white.  This may, of course, just mean that people who look like terrorists (whatever that may mean) are not travelling, from fear of being hassled.\n\nI conclude that the only reason for the giant queues must be stupidity: there must be people who, even though they are asked about prohibited items at checkin, and even though this stuff has been in the news for weeks, still have drinks in their hand luggage, and then have to stop to abandon them at security.  Or who try to take more than one item on, even though they've been told not to.  And yet, I didn't see much of that happening.  I really don't understand why the queues got so big.  There were plenty of security staff on duty, too.\n\nComing back, things were much less fraught at Glasgow Airport, as they generally are at smaller airports, in my experience.\n\nThroughout, I have to say, all the security staff we encountered were cheerful, polite, and helpful, while doing a largely thankless, probably quite dull, job, filled with seemingly-arbitrary rule changes handed down from above.  I can't really fault them, no matter how daft some of the things they have to enforce may be.\n\nA last thought: we are being conditioned to accept travelling with photo ID, even within the country.  It was strange to see everyone queuing up to get onto a flight to Scotland, with their passports ready.  Now I'd be quite happy to see EU passports issued by the Republic of Scotland (as long as it <em>was</em> a republic), but for now, it was still a journey within the UK.\n\nAnd the strange thing is, it seems to be the <em>airlines</em> that are driving this, not the authorities.  I have had to show photo ID on RyanAir and EasyJet, but a few months ago -- this year, certainly -- I flew to Scotland with BMI Baby, and not only did they not ask for ID, but I didn't even have to see a human to check in: hand baggage, a credit card, and a self-checkin machine, and there I was.  That was before all the recent fuss, true, but RyanAir (and possibly EasyJet) have been asking for ID for years.  Are they secretly being used by the government to get us used to carrying ID cards?  And if so, why is it only some airlines?\n\nOr am I being unreasonably paranoid?  'Cos I only want to be <em>reasonably</em> paranoid, you know.</p></body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><h5>This Knife of Sheffield Steel</h5>\n<p>When you grow up in Scotland (or at least, when I did so during the sixties and seventies) you pick up a fair amount of anti-English feeling.  It’s mainly to do with football, but it is linked to what is seen as several hundred years of oppression.  Although the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Union_1707\">Act of Union</a> was, in theory, a mutual act between two independent nations, it is clear which was the dominant partner.</p>\n<p>I’ve lived in England — in London — for nineteen years, though, and am unlikely to leave (or not to go back to Scotland at any rate: if I left London it would be to escape the UK’s ubiquitous surveillance state  and paranoid anti-terror laws).  It should be obvious, then, that I harbour no great dislike of England or its people.  Indeed, to harbour such a collective dislike for fifty-odd million would be bigotry of the most ludicrous sort.</p>\n<p>However, I have long been bothered by the apparent inability of many English people to distinguish their country’s identifying features from those of the larger nation-state of which it is part.  And I’m further disappointed by what seems to be a similar difficulty that many of Dave’s <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/temperama/big_england/index.html\">Big England</a> guests have had: finding things to love that are uniquely and explicitly English.</p>\n<p>As I discussed with <a href=\"http://lightandbitter.blogspot.com/\">Roldy</a> on <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/temperama/2006/08/big_england_no2.html\">his Big England piece</a>, so many of the the things that people have chosen are not English — not uniquely so, at least.  Though many of them are uniquely British.</p>\n<h5>On A Catwalk Jungle</h5>\n<p>John Lennon was sadly mistaken when he sang “The English army had just won the war” — and not just because he was ignoring the contributions of Canadians, Poles, the Free French, and of course, the USA.</p>\n<p>That is poetic licence,  and it would be churlish of me to complain.  But it is perhaps the most famous example of the casual use of “England”, when the speaker or writer really means one or other of “Great Britain”, “The United Kingdom”, or even “The British Isles”.</p>\n<p>Some would say that it doesn’t matter.  However, I believe it is always worth taking care with language, to try to say precisely what you mean: how else are others to understand you?  Also, it’s bloody annoying to us Scots (and probably to the Welsh and Northern Irish, too).  Maybe that’s why they do it, of course.</p>\n<h5>Where the Well-known Flag of England Flies</h5>\n<p>It used to be that the English also seemed confused about which country they meant at football matches.  All through my childhood and well into my twenties I wondered why English football fans supported their country using an emblem that contained representations of two other countries as well as their own.  I’m speaking of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Flag\">Union Flag</a>, of course.  Stadiums used to be draped in it, even when England were playing Scotland in the old Home Internationals (just as an aside: can you think of another country which has such a tautologically-named event?)</p>\n<p>What did they think the blue part with the white cross represented, I used to wonder?</p>\n<p>In recent years, though, football fans at least seem to have worked out which country’s flag they want to fly.  Which brings us back to why Dave started this whole thing.</p>\n<h5>Land of One Thousand Stances</h5>\n<p>I guess I like England; but it took me a long time to realise that I don’t have to like it in <em>opposition</em> to anything, particularly Scotland: I can (and do) love London, and still love Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>London is something of a special case, though.  While it is undoubtedly <em>in</em> England, there is a sense in which it is not <em>of</em> it: it is not really part of England, or of any country.  Perhaps all great “world cities” are like that.  The old song goes, “Maybe it’s because I’m a Londoner,” not, “Maybe it’s because I’m English and London is the capital city of my country”.</p>\n<p>So where does all that leave me?  In a word, I think, ambivalent.  All the things that I might list that I like about this country, I don’t see as uniquely English (except by geography), but rather as British: music, literature, scenery, beer, the BBC…</p>\n<p>Maybe the thing to do is turn it on its head.  While I would claim  The Beatles or The Clash as “British bands”, rather than “English bands”, I would claim Iain Banks or Irving Welsh, say, as “Scottish writers”.  So maybe I’m being unfair to England.</p>\n<p>But then, I’m in the oppressed minority.</p>\n<p>And cricket’s still the most boring thing imaginable.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It colors our present images to an extent that allows us to believe it’s real, but it isn’t. It’s gone. Pioneertown is burning. Today is the anniversary of my stepfather, Wayne’s, death. How can Baby Ry, Pioneertown and Wayne be nowhere?  </blockquote>\n\n[^mile]: The City of London, that is: the Square Mile.\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Well, Saturday the 1st of July, 2006 will go down in my personal history as something of a special day. First I manage to end up actually feeling sorry for the England football team (except for the idiot Wayne Rooney) — or more for their supporters, really, in the form of my kids.  Then Russell T Davies and the BBC give us the glory that is ‘<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2006/armyofghosts.shtml\">Army of Ghosts</a>’.  Warning: spoilers follow.<br>\n<!--more--><br>\n<a id=\"more-38\"></a><br>\nAt last.  At long, long last, Daleks and Cybermen together (and doubtless against each other).  I remember long ago in my university days, my friend Andrew (who co-edited <cite><a href=\"http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/misc/novascotia.htm\">Nova Scotia</a></cite>, as I was <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=36\">saying the other day</a>) putting forth the proposition that there should be a Dalek-Cyber war.  It being inevitable that two races each so destructive and inimical to other life forms, should fight if they ever met.</p>\n<p>And maybe that’s what’s going to get them out of this one: somehow or other the Doctor’s going to have to use one set of baddies against the other.</p>\n<p>But what of Rose?  How can she be saying,”This is how I died”?  I wouldn’t be surprised if she got trapped on the alternative Earth, but that’s not exactly death.  Could she end up trapped in the Void craft (and in the Void)?  The beach at the beginning could be virtual reality.  But even that wouldn’t exactly be death, and it couldn’t provide any way that she could be telling her story.</p>\n<p>The only thing that could make anything like sense, as far as I can see, is if she was telling her story knowing that she was about to die.  But I don’t really see how they could get to that state of affairs in the forty-five minutes remaining of the series.</p>\n<p>Still, all this speculation will look pretty stupid by this time next week, I suppose, as the <a href=\"http://forum.digitalspy.co.uk/board/showthread.php?t=408175\">speculation about “Army of Ghosts”</a> does now.</p>\n<p>My son was <em>crying</em> with emotion  when the Daleks flew out of the sphere.  We had, of course, seen the Dalek blast in the trailer, and he had said,”I think there’ll be Daleks in it.” While I said, “No, it’ll be Dalek technology that Torchwood have scavenged, and maybe even needed the Doctor’s help to get it working.”  But how right he was.</p>\n<p>We should have seen it coming, of course.  When the Doctor said, “There’s a storm  coming,” it was obviously an allusion to “The Oncoming Storm”, his supposed nickname amongst the Daleks.  So what could his oncoming storm be?  And then when he said that you could survive the end of the Universe inside a Void craft, it should have leapt out at us as an obvious place to survive the Time War.</p>\n<p>But I thought I had heard that there weren’t going to be any Daleks in this series.  In fact, I though that Russell T Davies himself had said that.  If so, then it was a great piece of misdirection — of lying, let’s face it — and I don’t hold it against him for a moment.  At last we got a properly non-trailed, non-spoilered surpise baddy arrival: the best since the Cybermen’s appearance at the end of the first episode of “Earthshock”.  Almost as good as the Dalek’s appearance in “Dalek” could have been, if the episode had been called something else and they hadn’t trailed it.</p>\n<p>Only one more week: what’ll we do without it after that?  <em>And</em> <cite>The West Wing</cite> ends the week after that.  Bah.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I am somewhat mystified by the talk recently about what team Scottish people, and various MPs, particularly Scottish ones, “should” support in the football World Cup.  There are no “should”s, of course: anyone can support any football team they want to, or none.  It’s just daft, at best, that anyone made an issue of it regarding the behaviour of our public servants.</p>\n<p>But the stranger thing, really, is that anyone might expect a Scotland fan  to support England under any circumstances.</p>\n<p>I don’t mean here, a Scot who takes little interest in football between World Cups, but might enjoy watching some of what should be the best examples of the game.  I’m talking about your actual, dedicated football fan.  Some people suggest that such a Scotland fan ought to support England because we are neighbouring countries, and part of the same meta-country.</p>\n<p>But consider this: Spurs and Arsenal are neighbouring teams, and part of the same city; the same can be said of Liverpool and Everton, Manchesters United and City, and perhaps most significantly, of Celtic and Rangers.  Now, tell me this: if Spurs were in the European Cup (as I still think of it) , would an Arsenal fan support them?  Would anyone say that an Arsenal fan “should” support Spurs?</p>\n<p>Well, I can’t speak for any of the English teams I mentioned above, but I come from a family of Celtic fans, and was quite a dedicated fan myself in my younger years (before I grew out of the whole thing, and put my interest into music instead), and I can tell you that there is no way on this Earth or beyond that a Celtic fan would ever support Rangers in <em>anything</em>.  <a href=\"/blog/2006/06/26/supporters/\">My Dad’s saying</a> about it not mattering who wins, only had a tangential application to the national teams.  Its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_form\">Platonic form</a> was, “It doesn’t matter who wins, as long as it’s not Rangers.”</p>\n<p>I’m quite sure that Rangers fans feel just as strongly about Celtic’s successes.</p>\n<p>The logical extension of this interclub rivalry is to the national teams of Scotland and England; and no doubt, to those of various other pairs of nations.  I imagine that French fans are unlikely to support, say, Germany against Brazil, just because they share a land border with one, and only a planet with the other.</p>\n<p>So really, expecting a Scot to support England is crazy.  Supporting the opponent of your greatest rival is perfectly natural behaviour</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Since I finished it this year, it belongs in my 2006 Book Notes.</p>\n<p>Before I get much further I should declare an interest: one of the editors, Andrew, is an old university friend of mine.</p>\n<p>So it might come as no surprise that I am more impressed by the very <em>existence</em> of this boook than by its content.  Which is not to dismiss or belittle the content.  There are some very good stories here, by some top authors and fine newcomers.  But the overall sense of it is less than overwhelming.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most surprising letdown is a sin of omission: where is Scotland’s most famous SF author; indeed, probably its most famous living author?  No doubt the good Mr <a href=\"http://www.iainbanks.net/\">Banks</a> has other things to do — I doubt that he writes short stories at all, these days — but you’d think he could have done an introduction or something.</p>\n<p>The introduction in fact is by David Pringle, the former editor of <cite><a href=\"http://www.ttapress.com/IZ.html\">Interzone</a></cite>: I had no idea that he was even Scottish.  But there you go: we get everywhere.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to go through all the stories, just hit a few high and low points.</p>\n<p>In a way the most disappointing story is <a href=\"http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.com/\">Hal Duncan</a>‘s ‘The Last Shift’.  Not because it’s badly written or anything.  Rather, because it’s not SF, fantasy, or speculative in any way.  It’s a sadly-commonplace tale of the last day of a factory whose company is “outsourcing” or “offshoring” all the work.  The fact that the characters all have wings and horns like the demons of our world’s mythology (and that the location doesn’t exist in our world) neither adds anything to it nor detracts from it in anyway: those factors are just irrelevant.</p>\n<p>Which is a shame.  I’m a keen reader of Hal’s blog, and look forward to reading his first novel, <cite>Vellum</cite> (I’m ashamed to admit that I’ve so far been put off buying it by the price: it’s a full-price hardback at £17:99, and that just seems a bit too much for an essentially unkown author).</p>\n<p>The high points for me  are probably ‘Sophie and the Sacred Fluids’ by <a href=\"http://scepticpsychic.blogspot.com/\">Andrew C Ferguson</a> (another disclaimer: I also had a passing acquaintance with this Andrew);  ‘Deus ex Homine’, by <a href=\"http://tomorrowelephant.net/\">Hannu Rajaniemi</a>; and ‘Snowball’s Chance’, by <a href=\"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static\">Charles Stross</a>.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I’m very glad it exists, and I’m glad I read it; but I hope the next volume, if it happens, is better.</p>\n<p>[tags]books, book notes 2006, nova scotia, sf, scotland, science fiction, scottish fiction, scottish literature, scottish sf, scottish writing[/tags]</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><h2>Eyes in the sky</h2>\n<p>There is a strange and mighty power to eye contact, it seems.</p>\n<p>I’m not talking about the effects of making — or not making — eye contact while talking to someone, though of course that does indeed have a great symbolic strength and communicative ability.  Rather, I’m talking about the effect of making eye contact at a distance; specifically while cycling.</p>\n<p>As you might imagine, cycling round the streets of London has its hazards.  It’s not as fraught with danger as some believe (fear of the dangers is one of the main reasons people give for why they don’t, or wouldn’t, cycle; which is a shame, because it’s good for the individual, and good for the environment), but that’s another discussion.</p>\n<p>Most potential problems can be avoided with a suitable degree of alertness.  But the necessary alertness isn’t all on the part of the cyclist: it’s important for other road users to be alert to the presence of cyclists, too.  Who remembers “Think once, think twice, think <em>bike!</em>“, the road-safety campaign on British TV during the seventies?  That was intended to make other road-users more aware of cyclists (and motorcyclists).</p>\n<p>That is where one of the biggest dangers lies: quite frankly, there are a lot of road users who just don’t notice cyclists.  And it’s not just the BMW  drivers and Royal Mail vans (in my experience the two most dangerous types of motorised vehicle, from a cyclist’s point of view (though all generalisations are false, of course)).</p>\n<p>No, any motor vehicle can be a problem, and pedestrians and even other cyclists are almost as bad.  Indeed , the two accidents I’ve had in all my years of cycling in London were both caused, at least in part, by pedestrians.  There is, however, a simple technique that can — almost magically, it sometimes seems — make other road users notice you.</p>\n<p>Look them in the eye.</p>\n<p>That’s it.  That’s all there is to it.  Just make eye contact with the driver, cyclist or pedestrian, and suddenly they realise you’re there.</p>\n<p>Which is not so surprising: it’s hard to <em>not</em> be aware of the presence of someone who is looking you in the eye.  What is strange, though, is the way in which it works at a distance.  You don’t have to be able to see the other person’s eyes, or even to see the person.  Innumerable times I have been hurtling along a road and seen a car or van about to pull out of a side road and smash into me (or at least, make me brake sharply).  I can’t see the driver because of distance or dark windows, but I aim a hard stare at the area where I know the driver’s head must be.  And the car (or van) suddenly brakes, and lets me sweep past.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a burst of laser-like staring swept across a group of pedestrians can stop them stepping off the kerb and into my path.  It’s quite remarkable, really.</p>\n<p>I’m reminded of the story of James Dean’s death.  He crashed his car into another car that was pulling out of a side road, and supposedly Dean said to his passenger, (who survived the crash), “It’s all right, he sees me.”</p>\n<p>Clearly, the other driver didn’t.  Perhaps if Dean had just tried looking at where the other driver’s eyes were, the strange, near-telepathic effect might have happened, and he could have lived to make many more films.</p>\n<p>The effect is, I suspect, related to the “feeling of being watched” that most people have experienced at some time.   There’s no obvious mechanism for it, but it does seem to be the case that, when someone is looking at us, we become aware of the fact.</p>\n<h2>Attention surfeit disorder?</h2>\n<p>When some one is looking at us, or is <em>paying attention to us</em>.  Which brings me to another angle on this.  That is the idea of <em>attention.</em>.  Up here in The Future, in the days of the development of “Web 2.0″ (which, by the way, is pronounced “two point zero”, not “two point oh”, as I heard them saying on <cite>Newsnight</cite> the other day; we are, after all, scientists) we are often told (though perhaps mainly by <a href=\"http://doc.weblogs.com/\">Doc Searls</a>) of how important our attention is.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the phrase “the <a href=\"http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_4/goldhaber/\">attention economy</a>” is in use by some.  Of course, the expression “pay attention” has been around for a long time, but only now has attention taken on some of the other trappings of money.  We can “pay” for a web site’s services with our attention.  Any site with adverts effectively meets this model, though there are more direct examples, such as <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/\">Salon</a>‘s premium content, for which you can get a “day pass” by <a href=\"http://images.salon.com/src/pass/sitepass/demo2.html?x\">sitting through a short advert</a> — as an alternative to paying actual cash for a subscription.</p>\n<p>The force of our attention — of looking — is powerful in multiple ways.</p>\n<div class=\"simpletags\">Technorati Tags: <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/attention\">attention</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/attention%20economy\">attention economy</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/web%202.0\">web 2.0</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/cycling\">cycling</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/eye%20contact\">eye contact</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/doc%20searls\">doc searls</a></div>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Like much of the rest of the London Blogosphere, I went with the family to see <a href=\"http://www.thesultanselephant.com/\">The Sultan’s Elephant</a> on Sunday.  I had had a quick look at it on the way home from work on Friday, when it was just standing still at the end of Pall Mall. Then, it was clearly impressive; but wasn’t clear quite how glorious, how <em>majestic</em> it would be once it was moving among crowds.</p>\n<p>We drove in to Holborn and took the Tube to Green Park.  The Tube was crammed, and I assumed (and feared) that everyone there would have the same aim as us.  But no, it was just a commonplace weekend crowd, with many destinations in mind.  When we got out, Piccadilly was busy, but not obviously in an unusual way.</p>\n<p>We could see that the road was partly closed in the direction of  Piccadilly Circus, so we headed that way.  In the distance we could see crowds of people, but no obvious <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/simon-crubellier/142413207/in/set-72057594125598140/\">forty-foot elephant</a> (and it’s hard to imagine a forty-foot elephant being anything else).  One of the stewards told us that it was going to turn down Haymarket and then into Pall Mall.</p>\n<p>Then, as we got a bit closer to the Circus, I caught a glimpse of a large leather ear flapping, and soon we could all see its head.  But Piccadilly had never seemed so long, and it began to feel as if we wouldn’t catch it, though it was obviously going very slowly.</p>\n<p>I hoped to get a picture of it with the statue of Eros in the same shot, but it was not to be.  By the time we got to Piccadilly circus, it had already turned into Haymarket.  So we decided to cut down Regent Street and get ahead of it.  Guess what?  We weren’t the only ones to have that idea.  By this time we were among crowds, but not so dense that it was very hard to move; just dense enough to make us keep a tight hold on the kids.</p>\n<p>A bit of zigzagging through back streets and we found ourselves on Charles II Street.  Iit was clear from the music coming from Haymarket that the elephant hadn’t passed yet, and from the layout of the crowd that it would be coming along that way.  So we positioned ourselves at the edge of the pavement and waited.</p>\n<p>Sure enought, after a few minutes some stewards came along the street asking people to stay back on the pavements.  Another few minutes and several police officers came along with the same message.</p>\n<p>It’s worth pointing out both how good a job the stewards and the police did, and how little they actually <em>had</em> to do (from what I saw of it).  It just goes to show that you can stage a big event with minimal crowd control.  Treat people with respect and give them something interesting to watch and you don’t need to herd them through crash barriers like cattle in a slaughterhouse.</p>\n<p>Anyway, a few minutes after <em>that</em>, and the elephant’s head began to appear round the corner.  It was, as I said above, <em>majestic</em>: that’s the word that came to my mind as soon as I saw it.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if it was the beauty of the beast, or the fact that there were bagpipes among the music that was playing (the pipes always get me like that); but I felt a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye as it approached.</p>\n<p>Then the fucker sprayed me with water.</p>\n<p>Actually, being sprayed was quite fun.  Fortunately it was a hot day.  But I got hit so directly that I could almost hear the operators saying,”Get the guy in the orange t-shirt and sunglasses.”  If you don’t want to get hit, don’t dress up like a target, I suppose.</p>\n<p>As the beast itself passed next to us, and I got a brief chance to admire the action of the legs (it moves on wheels, but the leg movement is very convincing), I realised that the music was coming from a truck behind it on which a live band was playing.  I had assumed it was just recordings, but the band added an extra touch, and we got to listen to them up close.  They were good, and I’d like to find out who they were.</p>\n<p>After it passed, and the crowd thinned a bit, we decided to head round to Waterloo Place to see the Little Girl’s crashed space capsule; not realising that it had been moved.  No matter, though: it meant we got another view of the elephant as it turned onto Pall Mall.</p>\n<p>And so to home.  We didn’t stay to see the finalé, so we didn’t see the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/simon-crubellier/141571479/\">Little Girl</a> at all; nor did we see her spaceship.  All that was left on Waterloo Place was a hole in the road, which people, in their infinite capacity to make a mess, had already started dropping rubbish into.  As it turned out, the ship had been moved to Horseguards for her to leave in.</p>\n<p>It was a fabulous thing to see, though, and I’m so glad that the Mayor and the <abbr title=\"Greater London Authority\">GLA</abbr> saw fit to have it here.</p>\n<p>My son asked me at one point, as the music surrounded us and the elephant towered over us, “Why did it come to London?”   I answered with joy and almost without thinking about it, “Because this is the best city in the world.”</p>\n<p>Sometimes it is.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Of course, I don’t expect anyone to take this advice: I’m just thinking out loud, really.</p>\n<p>But now, with local elections happening tomorrow, I’m in something of a quandary.  It’s always been easy in the past  —  or it was, before the last general election: vote Labour.  There, that was easy, wasn’t it?</p>\n<p>But now; now.</p>\n<p>Now Labour are the ones who are bringing in <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=24\">ID cards</a>.  They’re the ones who are trying to allow themselves to <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=17\">make laws without parliament</a>.  They’re the ones who’re putting a new face on sleaze by <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=18\">selling peerages</a>.</p>\n<p>There is no way I can vote for them while they support <a href=\"http://www.no2id.net/\">ID cards</a>; nor could I vote for any other party that did.  Nor, no matter how cuddly and environmental David Cameron appears, there is no way in hell I could ever vote Tory.</p>\n<p>In the last general election <a href=\"http://devilgate.livejournal.com/27082.html\">I voted Liberal Democrat</a>, and I suppose it might have to go that way in tomorrow’s locals.  The thing is, I’m not totally sure that I would want to enact a change in our local council.  Things have been getting quite good in Hackney’s services recently, what with their roadside recycling and what have you.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.respectcoalition.org/\">Respect Party</a>‘s <a href=\"http://www.respectcoalition.org/2006/local.php?seatid=69\">candidate</a> for <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4878524.stm\">Hackney’s mayor</a> is the father of a friend of my daughter, so I kind of know him.  He came to the door last night, and I asked him about their position on ID cards (not a local issue, of course, but still).  Totally against, which is good.  So voting for him is tempting, but I have my doubts about the party leader, George Galloway.  His performance at the US senate was genius, but there is still the “indefatigability” speech, and the way he campaigned against Una King in Bethnal Green.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the Green Party.  Always a possibility; but I have my reservations about their positions on everything but the environment.</p>\n<p>You know, I might not actually decide until I step into the booth tomorrow.</p>\n<p>[tags]politics, elections, voting, local elections 2006, hackney. respect party, green party, libdems, liberal democrat party, mayor of hackney[/tags]</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It should be nothing more than expected.  Nor is the fact of their re-offending in itself part of the scandal.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as has been said elsewhere, these thousand or so released offenders pose no greater or lesser threat to society than any other random thousand offenders.  Their only difference is that they are not British citizens.  Contrary to the belief, perhaps, of the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> and its readers, that does not inherently make them worse people — nor, indeed, any more likely to re-offend — than those of us who were born here.</p>\n<p>That they should have been deported if the court specified that as part of their sentences is self-evident.  As indeed is the fact that those who were released on licence should have been properly tracked by the appropriate authorities.  These are problems in the systems for which the Home Office is responsible, and as such, they should be investigated and corrected.</p>\n<p>The real scandal, though,  is that the Home Secretary apparently did nothing to correct the problem after it had been identified: he is said to have known about it for some ten months, and only in the last week has he taken any action.  And then only because a diligent opposition MP kept asking questions until he found out about it.</p>\n<p>In a sense the actual problems are minor: the supposedly-lost offenders have been located by the Police and Parole Service.  Most of them are now to be deported (which strikes me as verging on double jeopardy, since they have already done their time, but I wouldn’t expect this government to let a little thing like that bother them).  Steps have been, or will be, put in place to prevent the same thing happening in future.  If that proves not to be the case, there will be plenty of opposition MPs and journalists quick to point out that the problem still exists.</p>\n<p>What we are seeing is largely an excuse for a mass exercise in xenophobia by the media: a depressing and frankly disgraceful display, which can only help to fuel the arguments of the vile BNP in tomorrow’s local elections.</p>\n<p>And maybe that is why Clarke should go: for (inadvertantly) giving succour to fascists.</p>\n<p>But if Blair did accept Clarke’s resignation, who would we get in his place?

Quite widely spaced, so no immediate problem for cyclists or pedestrians: except that <em>anything</em> unnecessary in the way is a distraction and just adds to the complexity of a journey.  And what purpose do they serve?  All they can possibly be for is to stop cars and vans driving in that way.  And while that is something that has been technically possible until now, I wasn’t at all aware that we had a problem with it.</p>\n<p>Indeed, apart from floor-cleaning machines and those little luggage carts, the only motorised vehicle I’ve ever seen inside Waterloo is an ambulance.  I do hope they haven’t stopped those from getting in.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more significantly, they have added some sort of tall rack containing, I think, paper timetables or other leaflets.  But they’ve put it in the middle of the floor near the the departures screens.  So not only is it in the way, but from certain positions it obscures the view of the screens.</p>\n<p>Screens which have been hard enough to see since they were introduced, replacing the old big boards.  The screens’ main fault is that they are in the wrong places: over some of the shops which form islands in the concourse, instead of over the entrances to the platforms.  As well as that, the text on them is smaller than the old boards, so you have to stand closer to make them out.  This last will have the effect of amplifying the blockage caused by the rack (this can be proved by a simple piece of geometry, which I won’t go into).</p>\n<p>At least the rack looks as if it should be easy to remove; but bah, grumble, etc.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I take a couple of weeks off (a week at home with the kids, a week in Dorset: very nice, thanks, since you ask) and when I first get back to posting, I find I’m channelling the excellent <a href=\"http://www.20six.co.uk/disgruntled\">Disgruntled Commuter</a>.  This morning’s journey into work was a vision of madness and chaos straight out of Dante’s <cite>Inferno</cite>.</p>\n<p>I exaggerate, of course.  The Waterloo and City Line is a key link in my standard route to work, when I go purely by public transport.  Hackney to Wimbledon is not the simplest route between two parts of London, but it doesn’t have to be insane.  That line, though, is currently closed.  Until <em>September</em>.  If we assume it won’t reopen until the end of that month at the earliest, that means it will be closed for half the year.  I understand that things wear out and break down and have to be maintained: but it only goes between two stations.  There’s not that much to it.  How long can things take?</p>\n<p>So for two days this week I cycled to Waterloo (I work at home on Wednesdays) which is the best way to get in anyway, for all the usual reasons why cycling is best<sup><a href=\"#tal1_1\" name=\"tal1_1_back\">1</a></sup>.  But lately I’ve fallen out of the habit.  To break myself back in gently (in other words, to give myself a rest from it today, or out of sheer laziness), I decided to chance public transport today.</p>\n<p>I’m a great fan of public transport generally, of course: but there are times and services that… don’t show it in its best light, let’s say.  The North London Line is one that has a bad reputation at best: indeed, the aforementioned Disgruntled one has <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww%2E20six%2Eco%2Euk%2Fdisgruntled+%22north+london+line%22\">written about it</a> in the past.  Yet gettting that line to Highbury and Islington and then the Victoria Line to Vauxhall for the last leg to Wimbledon seemed the best alternative route for me.</p>\n<p>You’ll have guessed, since I’m writing this, that it was not.</p>\n<p>The North London Line is characterised by infrequent, jam-packed services, and it deserves the characterisation.  Don’t get the idea that this was a surprise to me: I knew perfectly well what it would be like.  What do you think was the biggest prod to get me back onto my bike?</p>\n<p>So that wasn’t really the problem (though the difficulty of seeing the station name signs when you’re jammed in standing up makes it extra hard for the infrequent user to be sure they are at the correct station).  No, the problem was my old friend<sup><a href=\"#tal1_2\" name=\"tal1_2_back\">2</a></sup> the Victoria Line.</p>\n<p>It was, in short, fucked.</p>\n<p>So I got on that curious bit of non-Underground underground line that also runs out of Highbury and Islington (and that I can’t remember the name of), and got a train to Moorgate.  Thence by Northern Line to London Bridge and Jubilee to Waterloo.  I left home at about 8:15 (significantly later than I originally intended to, admittedly) and the train from Waterloo pullled into Wimbledon at 9:35.  Bah!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<p><a name=\"tal1_1\" href=\"#tal1_1_back\">1.</a> Exercise, knowing fairly exactly when you’re going to get there, and not being at the mercy of the transport network chief among them.</p>\n<p><a name=\"tal1_2\" href=\"#tal1_2_back\">2.</a> Before I lived in Hackney I lived in Walthamstow.

Specifically, the Clissold House Cafe, in Clissold Park in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_Newington\">Stoke Newington</a>, North London.  The kids are currently at a tennis ‘camp’ (two hours’ intensive training a day for four days this week).  It being the school holidays, I’ve taken the week off work to look after them.</p>\n<p>So with two hours to fill, I went for a wander round the shops of Church Street (only bought two books in a second-hand bookshop) and now I’m back at the park, waiting for the tennis to finish.  I’m typing this on my Palm with folding keyboard setup.  It doesn’t have anything fancy like WiFi or Bluetooth, so by the time you read this it will be (at least) several hours later, when I upload it to the PC and post.</p>\n<p>The coffee’s not very good, either.

There’s only about twelve episodes, so it’s hard to imagine that there’s one I’ve never seen.  Then they’ve been talking about Thatcher as a battleaxe, which is an interesting one that I won’t go into here.</p>\n<p>I sat down to write fiction, but ended up doing this.

It is a portrait of a single day in the life of its protagonist, one Henry Perowne, a successful neurosurgeon.<br>\n<!--more--><br>\nFor a large part of the novel there is essentially no plot as such.  Indeed you could probably argue that the whole thing has no plot; though things happen early in the day that have consequences later in the day.  But despite the exiling of plot — of story itself, you might say — to the background, this is an immensely compelling work.</p>\n<p>Such is the quality of the writing (I can only assume: I can’t honestly say that I understand how he does it) that the small and largely insignificant actions of one man and his family, and the musings of that man (it is a third-person narrative, but with only a single viewpoint; it is exclusively focalised on/through Perowne) command the attention and require the turning of pages.</p>\n<p>This is great, really great; and the characters are endearing enough that I want to know what happened to them afterwards: indeed, what is still happening to them now.</p>\n<p>Everything I’ve ever read about this book makes quite a big thing of the Saturday in question being the one of the big anti-(Iraq) war demo in London (and around the world).  But in fact that is only really a very minor physical background to an early chapter.  Certainly it provides fuel for Perowne’s thoughts, and for a heated discussion with his daughter; but the fact of it happening on that day is not really significant.  Which makes me wonder whether he only did it as an attention-grabbing device, much as Banksie did when he set the first chapter  of <cite>Dead Air</cite> on the 11th of September, 2001.  Still, there’s nothing wrong with grabbing the reader’s attention, as long as the device is integrated fully into the story, and doesn’t jar with the narrative: and such is the case here.</p>\n<p>[tags]books, book notes 2006, reviews, this year’s reading, ian mcewan, “Saturday”, booker nominees[/tags]</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Turning away from politics, for a wee while, I’ve been finding things have been pretty good in the TV world, recently.</p>\n<p>I thoroughly enjoyed <cite><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/lifeonmars/\">Life On Mars</a></cite> on BBC 1, recently.  I expected slightly better — or at least different — of it when it was first announced: I thought there would be more (or some) ambiguity or doubt about whether Sam Tyler was experiencing it all in his mind while in a coma, or had actually travelled in time.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the start there was no such ambiguity about that, and we were deep in <cite><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_(Iain_Banks)\">The Bridge</a></cite> or <cite><a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,772790,00.html\">Marabou Stork Nightmares</a></cite> territory (if you can compare a TV series with a novel, then I’d say it’s better than the latter but nowhere near as good (obviously) as the former).  What I was hoping for in the final episode, though, is that Sam would wake up back in 2006; and that he would then look into the history of the personnel at the station, and find that Gene Hunt and the others (and DI Sam Tyler, for that matter) really existed.  Maybe he would even look up a now-aged and retired Gene, an Annie who is a grandmother.</p>\n<p>Obvious, maybe, but it could have been a nice touch.</p>\n<p>I had some mixed feelings about the whole thing, though.  I wanted it to be resolved and completed, for dramatic satisfaction.   But I so much enjoyed the interactions between the characters (especially the growing and grudging respect between Tyler and Hunt) and the quality of most of the stories that I became (and remain) keen to see more.  If he had woken up, there would be no going back.</p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/W/westwing/\">The West Wing</a></cite> maintained its high standard through the recent season (in fact this season, 6, was significantly better than 5 was, I would say) and I’m profoundly glad that we got a digibox and so could watch it on the excellent More4, rather than having to wait for the DVDs to be released.  More4 are taking us straight into season 7, so only <strike>22</strike> 21 more weeks and then it’s over forever.</p>\n<p>More4 is also where we get <cite><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Show\">The Daily Show With John Stewart</a></cite>, to give it its full-length name.  This is just a fabulous show; hilarious, thought-provoking and informative.  What more could you ask for?</p>\n<p>Well, I could ask for something as good — and in a similar vein — for Britain.</p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/\">The IT Crowd</a></cite> was disappointing enough after two or three episodes that I didn’t bother to work around its clashing with <cite>The West Wing</cite> on Friday nights).  I’ve read <a href=\"http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2006/02/06/\">some positive comments</a> on it, though, and it <em>ought</em> to have been good, given its pedigree; so maybe I’ll watch out for the repeats.  I wonder if that stupid announcer ever stopped calling it ‘The it Crowd’, though?</p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/hyperdrive/\">Hyperdrive</a></cite> was largely disappointing, and <cite>Invasion</cite> just petered out: that is, I petered out of watching it.</p>\n<p>Most importantly (in comedy, at least): at last they’ve started showing the trailers I’ve been waiting for: “New <cite><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423661/\">Green Wing</a></cite>.  Nearly ready.”  Hooray!  The funniest comedy of the last few years: right up there with <cite><a href=\"http://www.absolutelyandy.com/absolutely/\">Absolutely</a></cite>  I can hardly wait.</p>\n<p>And to top all that, my old friend from uni, <a href=\"http://talefromtwocities.blogspot.com/\">Paul Cockburn</a> inadvertently <a href=\"http://talefromtwocities.blogspot.com/2006/03/secret-devotee.html\">reminds me</a> that the new <cite><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho\">Doctor Who</a></cite> will be starting quite soon.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>There is now a deadly danger to British democracy.  One that is even worse than the <a href=\"http://devilgate.livejournal.com/31871.html\">ID cards</a> bill.</p>\n<p>Not for nothing are they calling it the ‘Abolition of Parliament’ bill.  Its official name is the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/141/06141.1-7.html\">Legislative and Regulatory Reform bill</a>, and it is, quite simply an attempt to take control of power in this country into the hands of the executive forever,and remove the possibility of parliamentary scrutiny from the exercise of that power.</p>\n<p>The bill grants ministers the power to create, modify or strike down laws;  and to introduce offenses carrying prison terms of up to two years.</p>\n<p>It contains some limits: for example section 3(2)(c) requires that “the provision, taken as a whole, strikes a fair balance between the public interest and the interests of any person adversely affected by it”.  However, remember that the bill grants the power to modify existing legislation; that does not exclude itself.  So if this bill had become an Act of Parliament, there would be nothing to stop a future government from modifying the Act itself to, for example, increase the maximum sentence, or remove the limitations it contains.</p>\n<p>This government has, after early successes in introducing the minimum wage and the Human Rights Act, been moving in a more and more authoritarian direction.  Obvious examples are ID cards; the attempt to reduce the right to trial by jury; and the increase in the period of detention without trial.</p>\n<p>But let’s not forget their support for US ‘extreme rendition’ flights, and the illegal detentions at Guantánamo Bay (they may not have actively and openly supported those, but they failed to condemn them, or do anything to stop them, which amounts to the same thing).</p>\n<p>From ASBOs to the ‘Respect Agenda’<sup><a href=\"#abolition_ftn1\" title=\"abolition_ftn1_back\">1</a></sup>, it’s clear that Blair and his spineless — or perhaps totally complicit — cronies are all about applying controls and limits.</p>\n<p>If this bill goes through, there are, as far as I can tell, two possible escape routes.  Judges — even the Law Lords — might strike it down as unlawful under the Human Rights Act, since they are required to consider all new laws in light thereof.  The problem there, though, is that the bill — the Act, if it passes — does not directly infringe anyone’s human rights.  Instead, it is an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act\">enabler</a>.  It is laws introduced or modified using this Act that may (that will, let’s face it) infringe our human rights.</p>\n<p>The second escape route?  I can’t see one short of revolution.  And that means civil war.  And that’s no escape at all.</p>\n<p>If you’re reading this, please: don’t just take my word for it.  Visit the <a href=\"http://saveparliament.org.uk/\">Save Parliament</a> website and look at the resources there.  Do some other research.  But when you are suitably terrified, <a href=\"http://www.writetothem.com/\">write to your MP</a>; write to the editor of your favourite paper and ask them why they are not kicking up a fuss about this.  Tell your friends.  Tell your enemies.  Tell people in the street</p>\n<p>If we don’t stop this, it may not mean jackboots in the streets and the knock on the door in the night; but it will mean the effective end of democracy in the UK.</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<a href=\"#abolition_ftn1_back\" title=\"abolition_ftn1\">1.</a><br>\nOn ‘respect’: I am convinced that Blair doesn’t mean that word as the rest of us mean it.  Instead, what he really wants to see more of in society is <em>deference</em>.  When I thought of this truth several months ago, my attitude was, “Stuff it mate, we’ve left that behind us a century or more ago, and we ain’t going back to it.”  But now, of course, I feel the terror that deference will be made mandatory by ministerial diktat.\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

This one is on my own site, for one thing.</p>\n<p>A new blog, though: just what the world needs, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/\">don’t you think</a>?</p>\n<p>As this is the first entry here, I can’t help but feel a certain… pressure, let’s say.  Because, after all, in years to come, when this blog is one of the most popular sites on the internet<sup><a title=\"first_note1_back\" href=\"#first_note1\">1</a></sup>, millions of people will look back through the entries, and pay special attention to the first one.  Obviously its content is critically important.  Unfortunately, its content is rubbish.</p>\n<p>Well, its content was going to be rubbish: or rather, <em>about</em> rubbish; about the guy who was <a href=\"http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=361722006\">fined for dropping rubbish into a bin</a>.</p>\n<p>But many people have written about the stupidity of that, and in any case, the council in question have already, and predictably, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/4792490.stm\">gone back on their foolish decision</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead I thought I might write about the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/4788912.stm\">hat woman</a>.  But actually that’s too boring to go into.  Pubs with “no-hat” rules, though: truly madness walks among us.  Actually, the scary thing about that story is that there are pubs with CCTV cameras <em>inside</em> them.  Truly we are the most watched society in the world.</p>\n<p>Maybe that should be the theme of this blog, if it needs one: the madness of modern society.</p>\n<p>I’d hate to come over like some old grouch, though, railing against modernity: “It wisnae like that when ah wuz a wean, by the way jimmy.”</p>\n<p>Or not too often, at least.  No, instead, like most blogs — like all the best ones — I’ll just write about whatever the hell I feel like.</p>\n<p>Modern weirdness, though: I just heard about the recent trends for “<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4792104.stm\">internet suicides</a>” in Japan; and the fact that the US Nasdaq exchange has <a href=\"http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1728537,00.html\">made an offer to buy the London Stock Exchange</a>.  Apparently there are shares in the Stock Exchange: it’s a company.  For some reason I find this immensely surprising.   I would have thought (if I had ever thought of such a thing) that it was some kind of public body, like the Bank of England.  Apparently not, though.   Life’s strangenesses, I think, will be a recurring feature here.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a title=\"first_note1\" href=\"#first_note1_back\">1.</a> this is meant to be humorous, by the way.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It sounded absolutely fantastic, and I’ve wanted to read it ever since.

You can’t make yourself think “This won’t be very good,” when you actually think, “This should be pretty good.”  The trick, therefore, is to convince yourself to have a slight seed of doubt.  I’m not totally sure how well that can ever work, though.</p>\n<p>I did enjoy the book, however: it starts with a light, easy style, and has an endearing central character in Sumire.  <!--more-->The unnamed (though referred to in the back-cover blurb as “K”) narrator is a slightly-annoying, madly-but-unrequitedly in love  with Sumire figure.  They met at university.  Sumire dropped out to write; the narrator went on to become a schoolteacher.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the start of the book, Sumire, who has until then seemed largely devoid of any sexual or romantic feelings, falls in love with an older, married, woman; who then gives her a job as her <abbr title=\"Personal Assistant\">PA</abbr>.  Sumire’s love is also unrequited; indeed, unspoken.</p>\n<p>It’s when they go on a business trip to Europe, which culminates in a holiday on a Greek island, that something strange happens.</p>\n<p>It is a curious book.  It’s hard to work out what is supposed to have happened to Sumire.  It is, until then, so much a realist novel that it is hard to believe that the apparently-fantastic, dream world sequence that is all the explanation we get, is meant to be taken literally.</p>\n<p>Then when the narrator, having gone to Greece to help find out what happened to Sumire, returns home to Japan,  there is an apparently-unrelated section concerning one of his pupils.  He has been having a sexual relationship with the pupil’s mother, so when the boy gets into trouble, she calls him to help.  This section really appears to have no connection to the rest of the story,, and no bearing on what happened to Sumire.</p>\n<p>So while I enjoyed reading it, on looking back over it, it seems that  it is deeply flawed.  Or maybe I’m flawed, because I failed to fully understand it.</p>\n<p>I expected that it would inspire me to read more of his work, but it hasn’t: or not yet, at least.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I was listening to a programme (essentially a religious one) on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/\">Radio 4</a> recently, about ‘Intelligent’ Design (ID).</p>\n<p>It was the second time that day that I had heard <a href=\"http://www.seti.org\"><abbr title=\"Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence\">SETI</abbr></a> pulled in to support ID.  The thesis seems to be that, since SETI searches for meaningful information hidden within random noise, it is “the same as” the search for a designer amidst the seeming randomness of the universe.  The proponents of ID think that the complexity of the real world means that there must be an intelligence behind it.  But the main thing these people need to learn is that complexity does not equal design.</p>\n<p>Or not necessarily, at any rate.  They are doubly confusing themselves — and others, who may be unsure about the realities of science and the tricks of creationists.  They look at the <em>search</em> for order among the chaos, and liken it to — really, identify it with — the <em>belief</em> that order lies behind the chaos.</p>\n<p>Let’s put it another way.  SETI searches through random noise and attempts to find ordered data, all the while aware that the ordered data may not be there; indeed, to date it has not been.  It further proposes that, <em>if</em> ordered data is found, then that may imply that there is an intelligence behind it.</p>\n<p>The ID proponents observe the order in the universe and <em>assume</em> that there must be an intelligence behind it; they also see the randomness in the universe, and jump to the conclusion that SETI is doing the same thing as they are.</p>\n<p>It is arrant nonsense, of course, but then ID <em>is</em>, from start to finish.  Oh, don’t get me wrong: there’s nothing in the laws of physics, chemistry or biology that <em>precludes</em> the existence of a designer, a creator, a supreme being: a deity, in short.  As, indeed, there is no need for science to be incompatible with belief in, or the existence of, a deity.  Back when I was a Catholic, I remember one of my primary-school  teachers explaining that, while the <cite>Bible</cite> says that God created the world in six days, a day to God might be a million years to us.  Don’t take it literally, in other words.</p>\n<p>And therein lies the problem: creationists and believers in ID (who are just very thinly-disguised creationists) take the <cite>Bible</cite> (though which version, I have to ask?) literally.</p>\n<p>Which is a bit like taking any of humanity’s great history of myths literally.  Why stop with the Christian <cite>Bible</cite>, and their strange god, “God”<sup><a href=\"#IDesign1_1\">1</a></sup>?  Let’s take the Norse gods literally, for example.  So the next time you’re caught in a thunderstorm, remember, it’s not just the random discharge of static electricity in the atmosphere: Thor is after you.</p>\n<p>Or the Greeks: they had some great ones.  When you light the gas to cook tea tonight, say a prayer of thanks to Prometheus, OK?</p>\n<p>Oh look, we seem to be back at my latest <a href=\"http://devilgate.livejournal.com/tag/book+notes\">Book Notes</a> post, <a href=\"http://devilgate.livejournal.com/32227.html\"><cite>American Gods</cite></a>.  Which makes sense, since it is American fundamentalist Christers who want to foist their god on the rest of their country — and by extension, on the rest of the world.  By the not-so-subtle device of using the law to control what can and can’t be taught in schools.  What is wrong with these people?  Have they never heard of the separation of church and state?</p>\n<p>Fortunately the US courts seem to be holding the line of sanity so far; but oh my non-existent, speculative all-powerful creator-figure: I hope we don’t get a branch of the Christian Taliban trying to introduce this shite into our schools over here.  I have children to bring up, so I have a direct interest in these things.</p>\n<p>Let’s not teach our kids to be stupid.</p>\n<hr><a name=\"IDesign1_1\">1</a>.

I had read the first chapter online, and I had an idea roughly what it was about: real gods (maybe all gods) walking the Earth in the present day.</p>\n<p>And it’s a stormer of a book.  The pages just keep turning, the quotes are quotable (girl-Sam’s “<a href=\"http://www.zeppscommentaries.com/Other_Voices/catechism.htm\">I believe</a>” speech is particularly fine) and myths are mashed up in glorious style.</p>\n<p>It’s shortcomings are, perhaps, that it slows down a bit too much in the middle section; and Wednesday and Shadow make perhaps too many visits to down-at-heel gods without anything very specific happening during them.  It reads like a road movie in places (which is fine), and it would probably make a good one.</p>\n<p>There are surprises right up to the end, though, and I’m sure I’ll read it again in the future.</p>\n<p>Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/books\" rel=\"tag\">books</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/book%20notes\" rel=\"tag\">book notes</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/2american%20gods\" rel=\"tag\">american gods</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/neil%20gaiman\" rel=\"tag\">neil gaiman</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/2006\" rel=\"tag\">2006</a></p>\n</body></html>\n",

Oh, maybe not now, and maybe not even that soon; but when the identity cards bill is passed, and the database has been built <sup><a href=\"#id1_1\">1</a></sup> then the infrastructure will be in place for the world’s largest ever experiment in social control.</p>\n<p>We already have near-ubiquitous surveillance, with constantly-improving automatic recognition: of faces and of vehicle number plates.  Add to that the national identity database with its biometrics, and the growing collection of DNA data, and I foresee the potential for a future that even Orwell in his worst nightmare wouldn’t have believed possible.</p>\n<p>Pessimistic?  Yes, certainly.  It may be that the public will rebel against it when they realise how much it will cost, for example.  I gather that that is what happened in Australia.  But even if they do, once the legislation is in place, how can it be stopped?  It seems likely that the best we can hope for there is a change of government.   And realistically, that means the Tories.</p>\n<p>After all this time there’s no way on this Earth that I’m going to put my faith in that lot.  No matter that they might have voted against the government on the bill, if they get into power and the act is in force, there isn’t a chance — not a chance in all the worlds of the putative multiverse — that they’ll repeal the legislation.</p>\n<p>In fact, that is the true nightmare scenario: it’s possible that Blair and Brown are not actually malicious about this, just stupid and corrosively misguided.  Imagine, though, what it would have been like if Thatcher’s government had had ubiquitous, mandatory ID and surveillance.  Imagine (as <a href=\"http://devilgate.livejournal.com/26650.html\">I’ve suggested before</a>) if that had been the situation during the miners’ strike.  Or when MI5 were undermining the Callaghan government, for that matter, although that’s a slightly different nightmare.</p>\n<p>And it just goes on and on: the Metropolitan Police are now <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4706158.stm\">going to drug-test their own officers</a>.  Now, you can safely argue that police officers shouldn’t be under the influence while on duty: but it is a clear violation of their personal liberty, and it just adds to the way in which our national culture is becoming more and more authoritarian.  Even totalitarian.</p>\n<hr>\n<a id=\"id1_1\" name=\"id1_1\">1</a>.

If so, though  then the whole book is a metaphor, and I’m not entirely sure for what.</p>\n<p>Since Alan (or Adam, or Albert, or Aaron) is very different from other people (he doesn’t have a navel, for one very minor thing) it could be seen as about alienation.  Alan, however, is not particularly alienated.</p>\n<p>His brothers are a different matter, though.</p>\n<p>Each of the five is given a name starting with the next letter of the alphabet after the previous brother’s; but they are not called constantly by this name, either by each other or by the narrator.  Instead, they are called by a seemingly-randomly-chosen name starting with ‘their’ letter of the alphabet.  There seems no real purpose to it.  If it is intended to emphasise the brothers’ ‘otherness’, then it does so: but not enough.</p>\n<p>As well as that, each brother has a unique characteristic.  Billy, Buddy, Bob (etc) can see the future.  Charlie is an island.  Davey is twisted, damaged and dangerous.  And Ed, Fred and George are a sort of composite being, living inside each other like Russian dolls.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, one of the subplots centres on one of Cory’s real-world interests: building a free, community-supported wireless network across the city (his native Toronto, in this case).

Just as <cite>Nineteen Eighty Four</cite> is; and Orwell’s masterpiece is perhaps the best reference point for <cite>Cloud Atlas</cite>.  The appearance of <strike>O’Brien’s</strike> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Goldstein\">Goldstein</a>‘s book within Winston Smith’s story may well have been a model for Mitchell’s multiply-embedded stories.</p>\n<p><!--more--><br>And like <cite>Nineteen Eighty Four</cite>, <cite>Cloud Atlas</cite> is ultimately a bleak vision, though it contains many life-affirming moments on its way.</p>\n<p>The interleaved narratives spread across the history and future history of civilisation, from Victorian missionaries ‘civilising’ the ‘savages’ of Polynesia, to the  Hawaian islanders after the fall of civilisation, trying desperately to hold on to the ‘Smart’ of the ‘Old’uns’.</p>\n<p>Each story contains a reference to the the one in which it is immediately embedded, and there are echoes and references across various of the layers: probably many more than I got on a first reading.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s command of the different styles is good, though there are one or two places where it slips, and where you wonder how reliable the narrators are.</p>\n<p>I found it slow to get going, though: at first I put this down to not being terribly engaged with the Victorian opening section.  Then I thought it was just pacing: the speed of the segments increases, it seems to me, as you work towards the centre.  But on the way back out I found the final section, back in the Victorian journals, just less interesting than any of the others.  I find the idea of historical novels deeply uninteresting, so we probably have a common theme there.</p>\n<p>Also related to the “is it genre” question  is this curiousity: in the section entitled <cite>Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery</cite>, the title character’s dead father is called Lester.  Lester Rey.  Sounds an awful lot like <a href=\"http://www.gwillick.com/Spacelight/delrey.html\">Lester del Rey</a>, the science fiction writer and editor.  Of, course, it may mean nothing: but writers don’t choose characters’ names for nothing, and it sems likely to me that you would at least check that the major characters’ names don’t relate to any real people.   So perhaps Mitchell is suggesting something.</p>\n<p>But all of this matters little.

But I ought to be able to get through a few more than last year, since I’m not doing an <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/\">OU</a> course.  And in fact it’s nearly the end of January, and I have already read three books and started a fourth: so, not too bad, then.  I’m just a bit behind on posting about them.</lj></p>\n<p>For Christmas I got volume 1 of <cite>A Dance to the Music of Time: A Question of Upbringing</cite>.  I started reading it on Christmas day, so we’ll have to allow the year to start and end there.</p>\n<p>I have been hearing quite a lot about Anthony Powell’s twelve-volume masterpiece recently: there was a whole Radio 4 programme about it, which I heard bits of twice.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>This was written before Christmas, and is only being posted now.  Such is… something.  My ability to get things done, probably.</p>\n<p>The Brixton Academy oozes rock ‘n’ roll history from its very walls; and a lot of that history is — or closely mirrors — my own.  I saw my first London gig there: <a href=\"http://www.ramones.com/\">The Ramones</a>, in 1987 (and I saw them a few more times there, too, I can tell you).  <a href=\"http://www.abc.se/%7Em8996/cubes/cubes.html\">The Sugarcubes</a> spent a bare hour on stage, and it was one of the best hours of live music I’ve ever seen.  The <a href=\"http://www.4ad.com/pixies/\">Pixies</a> took the place apart and restored my faith in rock ‘n’ roll when I didn’t even realise I was losing it.  <a href=\"http://www.slf.com/\">Stiff Little Fingers</a> — who were the first band I ever saw live (Glasgow Apollo, 1980) — played a farewell gig there (OK, they later reformed, but lets not worry too much about that).  At one <a href=\"http://www.jamestheband.com/\">James </a>gig there, a moshpit full of lovemuppets collapsed on top of me.</p>\n<p>But I’ve seen <a href=\"http://www.pogues.com/\">The Pogues</a> there more often than anyone else.</p>\n<p>And The Pogues, it seems, have reformed, and are touring.   To Brixton, then, with <a href=\"http://swisstone.livejournal.com/\" class=\"lj-user\">swisstone</a>.   I saw them so many times in the eighties and early nineties that I probably wouldn’t have bothered this time.  But back in the summer <a href=\"http://karmicnull.livejournal.com/\" class=\"lj-user\">karmicnull</a> gave me a CD by an American band called the <a href=\"http://www.dropkickmurphys.com/\">Dropkick Murphys</a>, which I love; and guess who was the support band?</p>\n<p>The Murphys take US hardcore (in the punk sense) and Irish (and a touch of Scottish) music, and mash them together in the same way The Pogues first did with UK punk and Irish music two decades ago.  Loud thrashing guitars meld with bagpipes and rebel lyrics.  There are about six or seven of them, and they move around the Academy’s huge stage like it’s their playground.</p>\n<p>That said, and though they rocked mightily, the cavernous space of the Academy did them no favours.  They would, I think, be enjoyed best in a smaller venue.  About a tenth of the size, say.  I found it hard work to appreciate some of the songs I don’t know, so I suspect that if you don’t know their work at all, they would be very hard work indeed, live.  Then there’s their version of ‘The Wild Rover’.  Maybe Americans aren’t as used as we are to every dodgy folk band or drunken denizen of an Irish pub singing this one: but you’d think that when your forté is speeded up, punked up versions of Irish songs, you wouldn’t do a version of it that is, frankly, plodding.</p>\n<p>No matter: I’ve now heard them do ‘Fields of Athenry’, live, and am happy.</p>\n<p>As to The Pogues: what with one thing and another, I wasn’t totally sure what to expect, after all this time.  But I shouldn’t have worried: it was like coming home: both for them and for me.</p>\n<p>Let me say this, in no uncertain terms: I don’t think Shane is anywhere near as fucked up as we think he is.  Yes, he’s done himself damage over the years, and I’ve seem him interviewed on TV and been embarassed and wished they had left him alone.  But that night, although he moved with something of an Ozzy-Osbourne-esque shamble, he was totally switched on.  He didn’t miss a single word, as far as I could tell, and the only mistake he made was that he messed up the first verse of the very last song, ‘Fiesta’; and that’s the kind of thing that any singer can do.</p>\n<p>Physically, too, he was very together.  During one song he kept playing with the mike stand, for example, and seemed to constantly be on the verge of knocking it over: but he always caught it.  And at one point he balanced a glass of water on his head.</p>\n<p>But what of the music?  It was, of course, superb.  I say “of course” because The Pogues consists of some of the most talented musicians in rock ‘n’ roll, and perhaps the English language’s greatest living poet.</p>\n<p>One of their greatest abilities is to make London seem magical, mystic ghostly: songs like ‘Lullaby of London’ is a fine example of this.  And ‘London You’re A Lady’ and ‘Misty Morning, Albert Bridge’ are hymns to the city that are rooted in more mundane concerns; but they still evoke a lyrical beauty.  In a way the effect is not unlike that of Wordsworth’s ‘<a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/101/520.html\">Composed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802</a>‘.  Yes, I think Shane McGowan is as important a poet as Wordsworth, all right?</p>\n<p>There was a spectre hanging over the show, though: it was nearly Christmas, and it was unthinkable that they wouldn’t do ‘Fairytale of New York’.  But who would sing Kirsty McColl’s part?  The song is inherently a duet; there is no way it could be done without two voices.</p>\n<p>Tony told me he had heard that Cerys Matthews of Catatonia sang it at the Cardiff gig, but he didn’t think that she was touring with them.</p>\n<p>So the end of the third encore and second hour drew close.  “This is ‘Fairytale of New York’”, Shane growled, to cheers.  Then one of the others introduced “Miss Ella Finer.”  One of The Pogues is Jem Finer, as I’m sure you’ll know if you’ve read this far; so I suspected this was his daughter (and internet sources confirm this).</p>\n<p>She wasn’t Kirsty, of course, but she did a fine job.  Some of her vowels were on the plummy side (“Happy Christmas your arse, I pray God it’s our larst”, if you see what I mean): but you can’t hold that against her.</p>\n<p>So as far as I’m concerned, The Pogues are back.

He was doing one night in London, with, as it turned out, the executive producer and the head writer of the show.</p>\n<p>It was good, though it could cynically be seen as an extended advert for their book, <cite>America: The Book</cite>.  The largest part of the 75-minute show  consisted of readings of extracts from the book.  Those were enough to make me want to buy it,  but the the funniest lines were probably in Stewart’s introductory piece.  The final section, consisting of questions from the audience, showed that both he and his co-stars are generally witty and able to think on their feet.</p>\n<p>If volume of applause is a measure, though, the highlight of the night for much of the audience was a brief guest appearance.  “For this next section we’re going to ask for help from a member of the audience.  We picked him before we started, so don’t get up.”  Then a stocky, black-clad figure walked on.  From my position high on the balcony, and with my notedly-poor facial-recognition skills, I couldn’t tell who it was (though Frances, sitting next to me, could).   I’d have recognised his voice, though.  Ricky Gervais is officially more popular in London than Jon Stewart (which is not a surprise).</p>\n<p>Gervais read the “funny names” from the book.  This is a section on how US newscasters, weather forecasters and so on, can’t have anything like an ordinary name.  The authors identified formulas for the name-construction for the various roles.  “A monosyllabic kitchen-related verb, followed by two unconnected words.  Eg ‘Chop Muddybottom.’”</p>\n<p>As further evidence, were it needed, of my poor celeb-recognition, apparently I literally rubbed shoulders with Alan Rickman on the way out; then Frances said, “There’s Salman Rushdie over there.”  “Where?”  “There: standing in the middle of the road, with all the people round him.”</p>\n<p>I did even eventually see him, and recognised him.  And while I accept that I’m bad at recognising faces — and celebrities in particular — I would contend that I just hadn’t noticed him in the crowd at first, and recognised him perfectly well once I knew he was there..</p>\n<p>Oh, and the title of this post?  “We don’t torture.  We like to call it, uh, ‘freedom tickling’”</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Now, I read the first chapter of this a long time ago, in the dealers’ room at a convention.  I liked it a lot, and wanted to read on, but the hardback was a bit too expensive at the time.</p>\n<p>I decided to keep an eye out for the paperback.  And I did: over the years I often checked the shelves for it, but never found it. As far as I could tell, it never came out in paperback, at least in this country.</p>\n<p>And all of this was before Amazon and so on, so I couldn’t just search for it. By the time web-based sales were here, I guess I had forgotten about it.  Certainly I never thought to do a search for it.</p>\n<p>Then in the summer we were in Hay-on-Wye, town of bookshops, for a day.  I managed to spend less than £30 on books (though obviously I could have spent a lot more). <br>\nBut, among my purchases, there it was: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0575071362/102-4550243-4050562?v=glance&amp;n=283155\">the Gollancz classics re-issue of Mindplayer</a>.  Slightly strange to find that the book has gone from first publication to classic re-issue in my lifetime, but there you go.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it’s been high on my to-read pile since then; and I started reading it a week or so ago; alternating it with <a href=\"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/\">Charles Stross</a>‘s <a href=\"http://www.accelerando.org/\"><cite>Accelerando</cite></a> when my  <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/review/palm_m505_review\">Palm</a> is charged.</p>\n<p>Now, as I read the first chapter, the fact that it was familiar to me was not at all surprising; I read it at the con years ago, right?  But then I got on to chapter two, as you do.   Strangely, that seemed familiar too.  Hmmm.  OK, maybe I’d read more of it at the con than I thought.</p>\n<p>Chapter three: the feeling didn’t go away.   Chapter four.  Chapter five. </p>\n<p>Gradually it became apparent that I had, in fact, read the book before.  However, I remembered nothing — absolutely nothing — about the story.  I haven’t finished it yet, and I still have no idea how it ends.</p>\n<p>This is a very strange form of <i>deja vu</i>, it seems.</p>\n<p>But it’s not the first time.  A few years back I read one of Paul McAuley’s novels.  It is perhaps telling that I can’t remember for sure which one, despite having looked over some reviews.  I <em>think</em> it was <cite>Eternal Light</cite>, but it seems I <em>still</em> can’t remember it.</p>\n<p>In any case, it very gradually became familar to me, and I realised I had read it before.  The copy I was reading at the time came from the library, and I figured out that I had taken it out before.</p>\n<p>In this case, with the Cadigan, I have no idea where I got the copy that I originally read.  Library?  Maybe.  Borrowed a friend’s?  Always possible.  Or did I buy it, and forget? is there a copy filed away in the attic somewhere?  I just have no idea.</p>\n<p>It’s the age, I fear.  Or maybe someone is playing with my mind.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Tall or short, dark-haired or fair, dark skin or light; none of this matters.</font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><font color=\"#000000\">All that matters is one thing: he is feeling vulnerable as he walks home tonight. He does not project confidence as he walks the dark city streets.</font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><font color=\"#000000\">Perhaps he has been drinking: a swift pint or two after work. Not enough to give him artificial confidence, but enough to lower his vigilance, to make him less cautious than he should be.  Perhaps not, though.<br>\n</font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><font color=\"#000000\">He doesn’t notice the guys in the shadows; or he does, but doesn’t register the danger. Or again, maybe he feels fear: but he’s got to get home, and there’s no other way.</font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><font color=\"#000000\">Whichever it is, he tries to hurry past them, but the blows begin to fall. He tries to run, but they grab him and hit again. He crumples to the ground and rolls against a wall to get some protection. As the kicks start, he slips into unconsciousness.</font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><font color=\"#000000\">Or again, imagine a child, at school.  He </font>–<font color=\"#000000\"> or she, their gender doesn’t matter this time </font>–<font color=\"#000000\"> is one of the smaller, weaker ones in the class; or just isn’t as physically confident or brave as some of their classmates. Maybe this is the child of the man above; maybe not.</font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><font color=\"#000000\">Bullying happens, of course: and this time it happens to the child we are talking about. Their life becomes hell. And it’s hard to find anyone to talk to about it. Parents don’t understand how bad it is. Teachers maybe don’t want to admit it’s happening.</font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><font color=\"#000000\">Maybe they’ll find help from <a href=\"http://www.childline.org.uk/\">Childline</a>, or similar.  Maybe not.</font></p>\n<p>What these stories have in common should be obvious: both protagonists were the victims of violent crimes.</p>\n<p>Now, would you say – would <i>anyone</i> say – that these imaginary, but all too true, characters were in any way responsible for their suffering?</p>\n<p>Of course not. No decent person – no-one with even the most basic shred of empathy and human decency – could blame the victim for the crime they suffered.</p>\n<p>Yet blame the victim is <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4453820.stm\">apparently</a> what one third of British people are prepared to do when the victim is a woman, and the violent crime is rape.</p>\n<p>We’ve got a long way to go.\n</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/%7Eswisstone/268154.html\">discussion</a> on <a href=\"http://swisstone.livejournal.com/\" class=\"lj-user\">swisstone</a>‘s journal suggests that the <a href=\"http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/reviews/2005/Amnesty%20International%20-%20Sexual%20abuse/Amnesty%20International%20-%20Sexual%20Abuse.asp\">figures</a> could be interpreted differently, and more importantly, that the questions could have been better phrased.  But nonetheless, it is a chilling result.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n</p></body></html>\n",

And whether it does or not, can we afford to take the risk that such an attack on civil liberties could be passed in any form? To some extent I don’t fear ID cards and the database state under a Labour government — even New Labour — so much as I do under a possible future Tory government. Imagine for a moment if Britain had had such a setup during Thatcherism, when so many of us were campaigning against nuclear weapons or for the miners, and were generally actively against the government. Or how would MI5 have made use of tools like those, when they were undermining the Wilson and Callaghan governments?</p>\n<p>Meg has more modern concerns, though:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;\">I have been told that tackling identity theft and child protection would be better served with some form of ID card – I will be looking into this more.</blockquote>\n<p>I have been told that when we die we all go to a big palace in the clouds and have wings, but the baddies are still going to be able to forge or steal the cards.  In fact, I think it could make identity theft <em>easier</em>.  People — or at least, institutions — may come to have such faith in database-backed ID cards that the idea of one being in any way <em>wrong</em> will be quite literally unbelievable. The end result will be that, in order to steal someone’s identity, <em>all you need to steal or fake  is one card</em>.  They introduce a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure\">single point of failure</a>.</p>\n<p>The next MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch concludes:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 1pt solid; padding-left: 1em;\">I have no problem with voluntary ID cards.</blockquote>\n<p>But it’s only short steps from “voluntary” to “voluntary but required if you want to use a bank account or leave the country” to “compulsory”, it seems to me.</p>\n<p>I’m pleased to see that Gavin Baylis is a member of the <a href=\"http://www.lcc.org.uk/\">London Cycling Campaign</a>.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>OK, so on Monday I posted the final <abbr title=\"Tutor-Marked Assessment\">TMA</abbr> for my <abbr title=\"Open University\">OU</abbr> course, <cite><a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/a103/\">A103: An Introduction to the Humanities</a></cite>. It was long, and broad, and mostly very good (though don’t get me started about the History of Science block). So now I have my life back: I can read whatever I feel like reading, and not just coursework and the texts I’m studying; I can write what I want to, and not just the essay for the current assignment.</p>\n<p>You have no idea — or rather, <em>I</em> had no idea — how much reading time a thing like that takes up. I do most of my reading while commuting nowadays, and sure enough, I did most of my studying while commuting. An hour each way makes ten hours a week. Subtract the times I didn’t do that, and add in the other time I spent, and I suspect that’s about the average time I spent overall: ten hours a week. Which is probably more than I did as an undergraduate 22 years ago. Well, OK, not counting going to lectures and stuff.</p>\n<p><!--more Musings on my academic choices follow...--></p>\n<p>Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but these days I frequently wonder whether I did the wrong degree. I’m glad to have a scientific background, and I don’t doubt that it helped me to get job as a programmer; but recently, given that I’ve been doing well on the OU course, I’ve been wondering whether I shouldn’t have done English all those years ago. Maybe, though, I wouldn’t have been so successful at it back then: perhaps I needed the experiences I’ve had over the years before I could tackle the Humanities with enough understanding.</p>\n<p>But I certainly think I should have done Computer Science rather than (or as well as) Physics. I did, in fact, express an interest in doing a half course in <abbr title=\"Computer Science\">CS</abbr> during my first meeting with my Director of Studies. It wasn’t possible (he told me) to fit it in with the half course in Astronomy that I was doing because I intended to do Astrophysics: they were both in the afternoons (unlike most lectures) and that would have left no time for my Physics lab. I was too shy and unassertive to argue the point; he was too uninterested to discuss alternative possibilities. Note that his role was ‘Director’; not ‘Advisor’ or ‘Counsellor’. Indeed, I put my failure to study CS squarely down to the failure of the Scottish educational establishment of the time to give me any careers advice worthy of the name.</p>\n<p>I accept partial blame for the latter failure, of course. At the ages of sixteen and seventeen, when I had what passed for careers advice meetings at my school, I wasn’t in the least interested in having a career (unless it involved rock ‘n’ roll); so I didn’t exactly involve myself in my careers discussions. University was just somewhere to go to get away from home, have money, get drunk, and all the usual student things; plus it was what my parents expected (not so much the getting drunk, etc, bits, but you know what I mean). But you would think that they (the careers advisors) could have worked out (or helped me to work out) that the only thing I really liked at school (I was good at Maths, Physics and Chemistry, and for that matter, not bad at English and Spanish, which werere the Highers I did, but I would never have said I actually <em>liked</em> them) was being in the Computer Club, where we learned to program in BASIC.</p>\n<p>It really never occured to me that I could study Computers at University. I knew, of course, that Unis had lots of subjects that we didn’t do at school, but I had no inkling of how you would go about starting one. I guess I was pretty unimaginative in that way. There was one guy in my class who was planning to do CS, but he already knew much more about computers than I did (hell, he even knew some Fortran) so that put me off the possibility even if I did consider it: clearly you had to know much more than me to study such things. I wonder what happened to Billy Gibson; the last I heard he had dropped out of Uni.</p>\n<p>If I <em>had</em> done CS, I don’t know that my life subsequently would have been that different. I suppose I might have got a job sooner, since I’d almost certainly have had a better degree; and it’s possible that that wouldn’t have been in London, which could have made a huge difference. But even if that had happened, London had been Calling for a long time, so I’m sure I’d have ended up here eventually. The main thing is whether I’d have been doing a particular philosophy course at the <a href=\"http://www.citylit.ac.uk/\">City Lit</a> at the end of 1992. Not doing that would have made a big, <em>big</em> difference.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Just watching the election results on BBC1, and Anthony H was interviewed in a Manchester bar, saying, <q>Stick with what you believe in … Blair made a terrible mistake in Iraq, and probably even he realises it now … we’ll get a bloody nose, but we’ll still be breathing.</q>  All downright good sense from where I’m sitting.</p>\n<p>Which reminds me, I must see <cite>Twenty-Four Hour Party People</cite>.</p>\n<p>In my last post I mentioned my <q>uninjured right leg</q>, but I realise that most people reading won’t know about my injury. A couple of weeks ago, on a Saturday morning, I fell down from a raised area in our back garden. I landed with pretty much all my (not insigificant) weight on my left leg. and twisted my knee quite badly. The consultant thinks I’ve busted my <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/18003.htm\">anterior cruciate ligament</a>, but I’m still waiting for an appointment for an MRI scan to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>So I’m hobbling around with a crutch and a knee brace, mostly annoyed with myself, because if I’d stepped more carefully, or been wearing different shoes, it probably wouldn’t have happened. The offending, extra-slippery trainers have been cast out into the recycling bin where there will be weeping, gnashing of teeth, and, hopefully, recycling. But it’ll be a long time, I fear, until <em>I’m</em> cycling again.</p>\n<p>Back on politics, who are these people who, apparently, want Britain to leave the European Union? What kind of madness is that? I mean, aside from the probable contribution of the EU and its predecessors to keeping peace in Europe for the last fifty years, and the advantages I listed <a href=\"http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.mccallion/pieces/vote2001.html\">here</a>; aside from all that: who the <em>hell</em> do they think we’d trade with?</p>\n<p>They’ve just announced that UKIP have won a council seat in Hull.  Mental.  Ooh, the BNP have <em>lost</em> a seat in Burnley.  Good.</p>\n<p>I’m writing this on my <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/hwswrev/pda/psionser5.htm\">Psion</a> (surprisingly hard to find a decent link for that nowadays) while sitting watching the TV. Said Psion broke down the other day. I sent it to <a href=\"http://posltd.com/\">POS</a> in Streatham to get fixed.. It came back today, and it has turned green (from being black before). There was no explanation, but I assume that what they’ve done is, rather than repair my one, they’ve transplanted the guts of it into a reconditioned body. It’s quite fetching, really.</p>\n<p>I like the mood of the discussion on election-night programs: it’s serious, of course, but there’s a lightness. You get a bit of banter between the presenters and the guests. Of course, it was a lot bleaker during the dark-blue days of the eighties and early- to mid-nineties…</p>\n<p>I don’t understand why there’s so much fuss over the postal ballots this time: we had them for the last two elections here in Hackney (first London Mayoral and local council). This time it’s back to proper polling booths, though. I much prefer it that way. How to increase turnout: let polling go on for, say, three days, and/or make polling day a national public holiday, as someone was suggesting in <cite>The Guardian</cite> the other day.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Strictly speaking, voting for Ken for mayor wasn’t a Labour vote, but I think you know where I’m coming from.\n</body></html>\n",

Why, then, should I suddenly begin to doubt the worth of writing about it?</p>\n<p>Well, it’s this here <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/\">Open University</a> course I’m three weeks into.  <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/a103/\">A103, “An Introduction to the Humanities”</a> covers an unfeasibly broad set of subjects, of course.  The idea is to give us a grounding in various disciplines, and the tools with which to learn to study them.</p>\n<p>So far we’ve looked at art history, literature (in the form of the sonnet) and this week, music.</p>\n<p>Trouble is, while I found it fairly easy to write about art, and even easier to write about literature (that’s why I signed up in the first place, as I may not have made entirely clear <a href=\"http://devilgate.livejournal.com/14417.html\">back there</a>), writing about music is another matter entirely, I’m discovering.</p>\n<p>It’s not that I don’t have the vocabulary: as well as what I know from general knowledge, and what I’ve learned in more years than I care to remember bashing a guitar, I’ve picked up enough in the last week or so to be able to discuss timbre and tempo and texture with the best of them (the best of them in my tutor group, anyway).  No, the problem is that I don’t find music evokes in me the images that other say it does.  Yeah, I can tell when a piece is dramatic or sad, for example.  But when in tonight’s tutorial they played a piece that everyone who commented said made them think of water in some form (except for the woman from Israel who said it reminded her of her national anthem), I just thought it was a kind of not-very-interesting swooshy piece.  It was, in fact, supposed to represent a river — it was a “<a href=\"http://www.faribaultcatholics.com/church/music/glossaryofmusicterms.htm\">tone poem</a>“, apparently.</p>\n<p>Maybe I’m unimaginative; but the problem for me, really, is the lack of words.  It’s always been words that have drawn me to songs — in combination with the music, of course: the best words in the world could be ruined by a crappy tune or insipid performance.</p>\n<p>But not <em>completely</em> ruined.</p>\n<p>I have concluded that most of the reading about music I listed above was actually rather about <em>musicians</em>.  Which is fair enough, but doesn’t help much.</p>\n<p>None of this is to say that I haven’t enjoyed the music section so far; just that it’s more challenging than the rest.</p>\n<p>But which blows my punk credentials more: having to listen to <a href=\"http://www.hildegard.org/\">Hildegard of Bingen</a> or <a href=\"http://www.j-tull.com/\">Jethro Tull</a>?</p>\n<p>Next week: philosophy.  In the meantime I’m off to compare and contrast St Paul’s Cathedral and the Millennium Bridge by means of interpretive dance.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Discuss).  But it <i>was</i> bad, there’s no doubt about that; and Hutton seems to have just excused himself from looking at that area at all. True, his brief was to investigate David Kelly’s death; but that death was inextricably linked with the evidence that was used to justify Britain going to war, and by failing to look at that, Hutton has let us all down.</p>\n<p>It’s such a shame, especially since the enquiry itself seemed such a model of openness for the Internet Age.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Somehow they slipped a <a href=\"http://books.fantasticfiction.co.uk/x0/x4359.htm?authorid=149\">new Iain Banks book</a> out without me noticing.  <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1844131955/ref%3Dnosim/authordatabase/202-9480152-3265423\">Raw Spirit: In search of the perfect dram</a></i> is his first non-fiction book.</p>\n<p>Ostensibly about whisky (more specifically single malts), it is part-autobiography, part-travelogue of Scotland (with a brief dip down to Chester) and a lot about cars and driving.  Rather too much about cars and driving, in my opinion; though it does celebrate Scottish country roads as the best places to drive, which agrees with my own experience and opinion.</p>\n<p>And the war, of course: he started doing the research (ie driving around Scotland visiting distilleries and buying whiskies: it’s a hard life as a writer) just as the war was starting, so its events were the constant backdrop to his travels, and he periodically brings them into the foreground.  It won’t come as a surprise to many to hear that his attitude is strongly against the war.  In fact he started his first trip the day he and his wife cut up their passports (which event I may have drawn your attention to before).  </p>\n<p>It’s interesting to see that, even when writing non-fiction, Banksie plays the same sort of structural games as in, for example, <i>The Crow Road</i>: he jumps around in time, principally; but it is never hard to follow. </p>\n<p>It does, however, show a degree of hurry and under-editing in places; I suspect it was rushed out for the Christmas market, and there are one or two paces where gaps haven’t been properly joined.  The most notable of these for me concerns the apparatus of distilling.  Banks gives us a brief overview of the steps in the distilling process, fairly early on, and then makes appropriate use of the various technical terms during later distillery visits.  All fair enough.  But there is one term for part of distillery’s apparatus — the <a href=\"http://www.whiskymag.com/words/lyne_arm.html\">lyne arm</a> — that he starts referring to without ever explaining what it is (I’m fairly sure: it is possible that I just missed that explanation, but I don’t think so). </p>\n<p>However, that relatively small matter aside, it’s a fun read, especially if you like whisky: though as I said above, it’s about a lot more than whisky.  This book will be good for the Scottish economy, I predict: it has already made me drink more whisky, and I’m sure I won’t be alone.</p>\n<p>How I came to get a copy is mildly amusing.  I heard about it because they were trailing it as <i>Book of the Week</i> on Radio 4.  Then I saw it in a shop and confirmed that it was by <em>the</em> Iain Banks, but didn’t buy it because Christmas is approaching.</p>\n<p>Then we had my team’s Christmas meal at work, and we did one of those ‘Secret Santa’ things.  And my present was… <i>Raw Spirit</i>!  Awesome.</p>\n<p>And one last anecdote.  In the unlikely event that anybody will be concerned about spoilers for the ‘search’ in the subtitle, I’ll put it behind a cut.</p>\n<p><!--more--><br>\nBanksie’s conclusion is, unsurprisingly, that there is no perfect dram, and one person’s favourite will not necessarily be another’s.  However, he does give some opinions.</p>\n<p>Probably the one he likes most of all on his travels is straight from a cask at the Ardbeg distillery on Islay.  Unfortunately, it’s a one-off and all the bottles are already spoken for, so it doesn’t really count.  His favourite of all the ones you can actually get turns out to be <a href=\"http://range.glenfiddich-whisky.co.uk/havana-reserve/\">Glenfiddich’s twenty-one-year-old Havana Reserve</a>.  It is aged in Cuban rum barrels.  This makes it illegal in the USA, and so leaves more for the rest of us.</p>\n<p>So I was on a work trip to Luxembourg a few days ago, and obviously stopped in at the airport shop on the way back.  They have an astonishingly fine array of whiskies.  And there, right at the end, along with the other Glenfiddichs: Havana Reserve.</p>\n<p>A quick phone call (international roaming is a fine thing): “Frances, what do you think of me spending 68 Euros on a bottle of whisky? … OK, you’ll get it for me for Christmas, then?  Great.” </p>\n<p>And so it awaits me under the tree.  I’ll report back on Boxing Day (or thereabouts).</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Of course,\nconsidered rationally, that is true of any of us, any time, about any\nexperience; Zevon must have felt it very keenly, though, whether or not\nhe was well enough to party.\n\nThen the line, \"I'm starting to fall in love with you\" suggests that,\neven as \"the old whore death\" was hovering in the background of his\nlife, Warren was still willing to take a chance on the great\nrollercoaster ride that makes life even more worthwhile.\n\nThe song has a similar effect on me to the film *Dead Poets' Society*,\nwith its advice to \"seize the day\": it makes me want to grab hold of\nlife with both hands and hang on for the ride. Because we're only on\nthis Earth for a short time, we don't get a second chance, and (I\nbelieve) there's nothing afterwards. We may *not* have this chance again\n--- whatever it is --- so let's throw ourselves into it now.\n\n> Three o'clock, Four o'clock, Five o'clock, Six\\\n> Let's throw it all into the mix\\\n> And open up our bag of tricks,\\\n> And party for the rest of the night!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[All quotes are from Warren Zevon's song, 'The Rest Of The Night', and\nare reproduced without permission, but with journalistic intent.\nSomehow, I don't think he'd have minded.]{.small}\n\n[^zevonfootnote1]: Well, OK, some are better than others, but only\nbecause some are worse than others.\n\n",

When he pretended he though the bullet was in chamber five and aimed down the room and we heard the <em>click</em>; the few minutes of silent anticipation that followed seemed like hours, and had me on the edge of my seat.</p>\n<p>This despite the fact that I was (and am) sceptical about the possibility that he could come to any harm.  I don’t know how (any more than I know how that Copperfield guy flew a couple of hours later (this should include a link to Channel 4′s ‘Top Fifty Magic Tricks’, but I can’t find it on their site)), but I’m sure there was no way he could possibly have blown his brains out.</p>\n<p>The strange thing for me was that, since he showed right at the start, with the cup game, essentially how he was going to work out which was the deadly chamber; and since it was clear in that cup game example that the guy hesitated slightly before he said the number of the cup in question; I expected to be able to tell which chamber held the bullet.</p>\n<p>However, they guy who loaded the gun (James?) was so nervous that he raced through counting one to six, with only, I thought, a slight hesitation on six.</p>\n<p>But he’d loaded chamber one.</p>\n<p>Is it just me, or does anyone else think that’s an incredibly weird number to choose?  My mind was screaming “four”, but that’s probably because it was cup four in the cup game earlier.  But to put the bullet in the first chamber.  I don’t know: what if Brown had decided just to start at the bottom?</p>\n<p>More significantly, how did Brown catch the hesitation in James’s voice when it must have come on the first number spoken?  Make it hard for the guy, why don’t you, Jimmy.</p>\n<p>And what does watching that kind of spectacle do to us as viewers, to television as a medium?  In Saturday’s  <i><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/\">Guardian</a></i>, Mark Lawson route about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1055685,00.html\">potential death as media spectacle</a>, saying:<br>\n</p><blockquote>Our culture is now so tricked out with smoke and mirrors that were Brown to fall to the studio floor under a gunpowder cloud – or, indeed, if David Blaine was carried out of his glass box in a wooden one – we could not be certain that we were really seeing what we thought we saw. In the spun world, the illusionist just joins a queue behind the politicians and other tricksters. In such an environment of lies and winks, the media need to set rules of truthfulness and keep to them.\n<p>If Brown really is risking his life tomorrow night, then it’s a moment of landmark depravity for television. But, if he really isn’t, then it’s a lesser but still terrible offence against the integrity of the medium. </p></blockquote>\n<p>And now I find that in today’s, he points out the twistedness of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1056879,00.html\">David Kelly/Samaritans/Russian Roulette</a> segue.

It’s all legal and above board: the artists get royalties per download, and all in all it seems like a fine model for how music can be distributed.</p>\n<p>Obviously not every artist on the planet is going to be on there, so it can be kind of disappointing sometimes.  However, the kind of artist that is there (in my brief study of the matter) is kind of off the wall, left field stuff that maybe doesn’t get major mainstream distribution.

They just <em>get it</em>, I thought.</p>\n<p>So I just started a trial subscription period: fourteen days, fifty files.  Plenty to choose from, and it’s all going very well.</p>\n<p>Or it was, until I started seeing this message appear alongside some albums: <i>Not available outside North America due to licensing restrictions</i>.</p>\n<p>And this is alongside, for example, <a href=\"http://aasearch.emusic.com/aasearch?rtype=search_art&amp;searchterm=the+birthday+party&amp;cid=emusic&amp;imageField.x=0&amp;imageField.y=0\">everything they have by The Birthday Party</a>.

It’s been a bugbear for a long time, and it’s time to put it out there.)</p>\n<p>Anyone who bought records during the eighties and probably early nineties, at least in the UK, will be familiar with the propaganda I’m referring to there.  At some point during those years, the record companies, in their wisdom, decided that the common practice of people making tape copies of their friends’ records (or records borrowed from libraries) was seriously eating into their profits, and had to be stamped out.<br>\n<!--more--></p>\n<h3>Hoist the Joyless Roger</h3>\n<p>Part of their programme to achieve this aim was the printing, on all album inner sleeves that didn’t have pictures or lyrics, of the slogan “Home taping is killing music” above a large skull-and-crossbones with the skull formed from the silhouette of a cassette.  Below this device was the text, “and it’s illegal”.  You can see a reproduction of it <a href=\"http://www.stunned.org/mt/archives/000015.html\">here</a></p>\n<p>Obviously, when first the young, would-be home taper saw this, they immediately gave up their nefarious acivities, destroyed any tapes they had already made, and went out and bought all the albums they had taped.</p>\n<p>Oh no.  Sorry: that was just in the dreamworld of the record company executives.</p>\n<p>Is any of this — even if you’re too young to remember those days — starting to sound vaguely similar to events in our present (and more recent past)?</p>\n<p>The parallels with MP3 sharing are undeniable; but are the conclusions the same?</p>\n<h3>Divided but undimmed</h3>\n<p>Before I consider that, let me just say why I think home taping was/is good for music.</p>\n<p>The fundamental point that the record companies never got, I think, was that records taped <em>were not lost sales</em>.  Taping was always a poor second-best to having the record.  I speak here from the point of view of a teenager at school, of a student, of a young adult on the dole: mostly we taped records that we wanted to hear or have, <em>that we couldn’t afford to buy</em>.</p>\n<p>Imagine, for a moment, that taping had never existed: that records had been released, but that there was no technology available to individuals that would allow a copy to be made.  Would we — would <em>I</em> — have bought all the albums that, in reality, I taped?</p>\n<p>I think it’s easy to see that the answer is “no”.</p>\n<p>I might have <em>wanted</em> to, of course; but there’s no way I’d ever have been able to afford to.</p>\n<p>So I, and thousands — maybe millions — like me, made tapes.  And in doing so, I got to know the music of the bands I liked.  And what do you do if you like, say, a band’s first two albums, which you have on tape, when their third album comes out?</p>\n<p>You buy it on record, of course.</p>\n<p>Especially if, by that time you are working and generally financially better off.  This is exactly what happened to me with, for example, The Pogues.  I heard them on John Peel, taped the first two albums (from <lj user=\"swisstone\">, as it happens) and gradually fell in love with them.</lj></p>\n<p>Then when their third album came out, I bought it.  Same with their fourth and fifth.</p>\n<h3>Make the switch</h3>\n<p>But it gets better than that, as far as the long-term income for the band (and record company) is concerned (or at least it did during the years of vinyl’s fading and aluminium’s growth).  Because tapes degrade; after a few years of heavy use, they sound shite, quite frankly.  But of qcourse, the music they hold doesn’t; our love for the songs doesn’t.</p>\n<p>Sooner or later you need replacements.</p>\n<p>This is why I have the first two Pogues albums on CD and the remainder on vinyl.  Same with others.  Or take The Fall: I have a mixture of vinyl and CD, and a still incomplete collection.  Keep them out there, the record companies, and eventually I’ll buy the missing ones.  On CD, almost certainly.</p>\n<p>I am, of course, a trivial statistical sample; but I strongly suspect that I’m a long way from unrepresentative.</p>\n<p>So my conclusion is that my taping activities didn’t deprive the artists or record companies of any sales; and <em>did</em> prepare me to buy the material later.  A net gain for artists and record companies.  And for me, for that matter: a no-lose situation.</p>\n<h3>It’s got to be perfect</h3>\n<p>But things have changed — or they might have at least.  Nowadays you can borrow a CD and make a CD copy of it: a bit-perfect, nondegrading copy (on the assumption that CDR doesn’t degrade, which is another story entirely).  Or you can rip it to your hard drive.  The MP3 encoding is of a lower quality than CD, of course, but most of us, most of the time, probably can’t tell the difference; and if it doesn’t bother you — or once you get used to it — again, there’s no deterioration.</p>\n<p>This all, I must admit, bothers me.</p>\n<p>Clearly there’s no problem with ripping your own CDs, for convenient playback.  Ripping, or copying, borrowed ones, though: there’s the rub.</p>\n<p>Because it completely blows my repacement theory out of the water, doesn’t it?  You’ll never replace your copied CD, because it’ll never become muffled and stretched like a tape.</p>\n<h3>Rip it up and start again</h3>\n<p>Well… I can think of a couple of occasions where you might go back and buy a copied or ripped CD.  One is to get the packaging.  A not completely unreasonable possibility; many albums are attractively packaged, with lyrics, sleevenotes, and so on.  But in equally many, even ones that contain glorious, deathless music, the packaging is at best an irrelevance (and I’ve long felt that twelve-inch vinyl records are better to own <em>as artifacts</em> than CDs anyway; not least because of the bettter printing quality on the bigger covers).</p>\n<p>The second is when you’ve ripped it and you lose the ripped files through a disk crash or similar (in conjunction with poor backup discipline, of course).  Indeed, there is a growing belief or acceptance that “the CD is your master copy” while your working copy resides on your hard drive, or in your iPod or whatever.</p>\n<p>So, it’s not impossible that we may go on to buy a once-borrowed CD.  But I think it’s a lot less likely than it was with tapes.</p>\n<p>So where do I stand on copying CDs?  is home duplication killing music?  Well, no: it’s clearly not as bad as that.  I’m not totally comfortable with duplication, so I rarely do it.  The fact that people out there will, however, doesn’t mean that the whole edifice of the music industry is going to come crashing down any time soon.</p>\n<h3>Stay tuned for more rock ‘n’ roll</h3>\n<p>Indeed, the other side of the digital music revolution probably balances out the problem of making copies: downloading.  The record companies don’t get this yet,of course, but on the whole I think even they will have to admit that downloading is good for music.</p>\n<p>This argument has been discussed to death on the net, so I can hardly bear to write it, but in a nutshell: you dowload — legally or not — a few tracks by an artist; if you don’t like them you never listem to them again and/or you delete them to save space.  If you like them, you go out and buy the album.  It’s as simple as that.</p>\n<p>OK, there are alway exceptions.  There are no doubt people who’ll be prepared to take the time to download entire albums; but they’re surely in the minority.  For most people the download model will, or does, work broadly as I’ve outlined it above.</p>\n<p>Also, I’m fairly sure that most people will be willing to pay a small fee to download tracks, once a suitable payment mechanism is found.  So all in all music-downloading culture is good for music — especially, of course, for the smaller artist without big record-company backing.</p>\n<p>All of this has been said before, and will be said again (for example, <a href=\"http://www.netmusicians.org/mp3_death/Mp3_death.htm\">this guy</a> presents a good discussion of it); we’ll have to keep saying it, I suppose, until the record companies listen — or until they just go away and leave bands to get on with doing it themselves.<br>\n</p>\n</body></html>\n",

And who am I not to join in?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>20 years ago:</strong> Just starting second term of first year at Uni.  Hadn’t been to Eastercon — hadn’t been to a con yet: RaCon was later, I think; and anyway, a good Catholic boy like me had been at home with his parents, going to midnight mass and all that.</p>\n<p>However I had got into SF fandom, via the <a href=\"http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/sesoc\">EU SFSoc</a> (of which I was later President, for what it’s worth).  Had started making several of my closest friends, whom I’m don’t stay in nearly close enough touch with these days.  Must have seen the Architects of Fear (seminal Edinburgh punk band, without whom <a href=\"http://livejournal.com/users/tickettothewest\">Burn</a> would probably not exist) a few times by then.  It was through SF Soc that I met <lj user=\"swisstone\"> and, indirectly, because they were a bit after my time, </lj><lj user=\"karmicnull\"> and Ol (my turn to say, “Get an LJ, mate”).</lj></p>\n<p><strong>15 years ago:</strong> I had started work in London the previous August (and  had a long-weekend trip to Brighton for reasons many of you will remember, if vaguely).   Exactly fifteen years ago I had probably recently returned from Follycon.  I was living in Tooting with some members of a band called The <a href=\"http://www.mp3.com/pleasurethieves\">Pleasure Thieves</a> — they had some fine songs which I remember fondly (so I was pleased to find, while researching this, that they’ve put a lot of them out via MP3.com).</p>\n<p>Also in the same house was their <a href=\"http://www.thegliders.co.uk/biog.html#Andy\">recently-left singer</a>. He left because the other band that he was involved with had recently got a deal.  Tensions were high, but largely unspoken.  The Jazz Devils put out a couple of albums on Virgin, but they had never played a gig before they got their deal so they had no following.</p>\n<p>The Pleasure Thieves regrouped as a three-piece and gigged heavily over the next couple of years.  I sometimes helped them out with a bit of roadieing.</p>\n<p>Later that year I bought a house in Walthamstow with two friends called John (if any of these people had sites I’d link to them).  Big mistake financially, given what was to follow, but we had a fun few years including putting a band together for a bit.  Never got past the rehearsal-room stage, though.  In fact, we never even settled on a name.  We tried out many, with The Void being the last and longest-serving, but we were never very happy with it.</p>\n<p>I wonder now whether we’d have done more if we’d had a name.</p>\n<p><strong>10 years ago:</strong> still in Walthamstow, but by this time the house-partnership was sundering — amicably enough: it was all to do with other relationships starting.  By this time I had met and was going out with Frances, (whom I’ve been with ever since), so I was spending a lot of time in Hackney, too.</p>\n<p><strong>5 years ago:</strong> Daniel, our son, was 1.  Living in Hackney, commuting to Wimbledon.  Holidayed in Normandy, on a farm where there was a donkey which Daniel loved at first, but then got frightened of when it charged down the hill braying loudly (safely behind a fence, I should add).  I had hardly touched my guitar in several years, but Burn were in the near future.</p>\n<p><strong>Last year:</strong> Fiona, our daughter, was 1.  We were starting,very gradually, to get the house done up, a long-term project.  I had been in Burn for four years, I think.  Holiday in France again, camping in the Loire Valley this time.  No donkeys seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Yesterday:</strong> At work: tail end of Meridian 4 development (soon to be shelved as we redevelop it using EJBs — though that release will probably still be numbered 4).  Collected kids, Frances working late.</p>\n<p><strong>Today:</strong> At work again; more of the same.  band rehearsal at Ol’s tonight: mmm, pizza, beer.</p>\n<p><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> It’s the working week, what do <em>you</em>. think?  Don’t expect the Mayday celebraions to affect me much, though work have warned us to be careful, “to avoid accidental involvement in violence”.  Yeah, but what about deliberate involvement?</p>\n<p><strong>Next year:</strong> should repeat this, to build up a year-by-year picture.</p>\n<p></p>\n</body></html>\n",

I have to say that I’m not sure how I feel about this.  I know I <em>ought</em> to feel upset that they’ve ‘sold out’ but I just can’t seem to get up the ire.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I’ve become too accepting of the capitalist society in which we live.  But it’s not like they’re being sponsored by a weapons manufacturer — or even McDonald’s or Nestlé, for that matter.</p>\n<p>Not that Levis are likely to be angels, but I just wonder whether we should cut the MC5 some slack: why should we hold them to a higher standard than we hold ourselves? (and we all work for corporations or governments, ultimately, don’t we?)</p>\n<p>At this point, though, I worry that I may be contradicting the spirit of <a href=\"http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.mccallion/pieces/vote.html\"> something I wrote a few years ago </a>, just prior to the 1997 UK General Election.  in essence, there, I said that becoming a parent hadn’t made me more conservative, but if anything politically the opposite.  This relative acceptance of selling out to corporate interests could easily be perceived as a step in the conservative direction.  And maybe that’s so.  But from where I’m sitting, it’s not me that’s changed, but everything else.</p>\n<p>That sounds horribly solipsistic, but the political landscape <em> has </em> changed a lot in this country in the last five or six years.  Though, if everything has moved right, that should leave the good Marx-fearing socialist<sup><a href=\"#PoliticsFoot1\">*</a> </sup> appearing to be even further left: unless they have been dragged with it.</p>\n<p>Which means my parenthood piece’s assertion is contradicted; but it’s not because of parenthood.  The question I have to consider is whether I <em>want</em> to be dragged around by society.</p>\n<p>I should just add at this point that I feel that I was in no way moved to the right by the supposed move right of society during the Thatcher years.  Obviously it takes a ‘Labour’ government to do that.</p>\n<p>Then at the same time, Karmicnull <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=karmicnull&amp;itemid=7836\">tells us</a> that Warner Hodges out of <a href=\"http://www.jasonandthescorchers.com/\">Jason and the Scorchers</a> has formed a <a href=\"http://www.disciplesofloud.com/\">new band</a>.  This is a surprise, because I thought that a) he’d quit the music business, saying he didn’t really enjoy making music, and b) there had been a Scorchers tour planned, which was still sort of in a state of ‘might one day come to fruition’ if he ever did come back to it.</p>\n<p>Still, people change (and moving ones do too); so what seemed right once may no longer seem so (and of course, having one band doesn’t preclude the possibility of playing in another; just ask Blixa Bargeld, for example).</p>\n<p>The common theme here seems to be, ‘people change’.  And in direct opposition to almost everything anyone ever says about that subject, I <em>like</em> change.

But on the whole I do.  I’ve had my ups and downs, of course, but I wouldn’t have stayed there for fifteen years, through name changes and takeovers, reshuffles and redundancies, if it wasn’t a reasonable place to work; and I wouldn’t have gone into that area, and stayed in it — not to mention resisted all inducements to move into management — if I didn’t like the work.</p>\n<p>I’m a programmer, which, in my humble opinion and personal mythology, is the third best job in the world (and I do the top two in my spare time anyway: see my bio).  So when, some fifeen years ago, the precursor of the company that I now work for offered me a trainee programmer job, I, having been on the dole for a year since graduating, was delighted.  Not only was I starting a programming job, but also I was moving to London, which, despite burning with boredom, had been calling to my faraway town for a long time.</p>\n<p>My personal graph of contendedness and the ups and downs of the job market combined to ensure that I stayed there ever since.  I have occasionally looked around for another job, but never quite got round to moving.  At the time when I was furthest down that line, for example, I was offered a move to a more interesting role, so I stayed.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of last year, senior management announced the latest round of redundancies (I wrote a blog piece about it, which, for various reasons, I never posted).  That safely behind them, they feel they have to justify their existence by doing the latest spot of restructuring.</p>\n<p>The division I work in is being split into three independent (allegedly autonomous) operating companies.  This comes some eighteen months after all the prior companies (the group grew by acquisition) were renamed and rebranded under the group name and logo.</p>\n<p>Both the rebranding and now the split can be seen as good decisions in business terms, and there are some aspects of the latest split that seem positive from where I’m sitting.  But here’s the rub.  Each of the new companies is to have its own HR and Finance departments.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m sure if you asked the board they would tell you that they had no plans to sell off any of the companies; and they probably wouldn’t even be lying; but could it be any plainer that they’re positioning things such that they easily <em>can</em> sell off the various bits if they’re seen to be performing poorly?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the company in which I am to find myself has announced the following facts (among others):</p>\n<ul>\n<li> it’s going to become a nicer place to work </li>\n<li> they’re going to tighten up on the dress code </li>\n<li> they’re going to tighten up on timekeeping (which had, over years, become informally flexible) and definitely <em>not</em> introduce flexitime </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I invite the reader to join me in musing about the incompatibilities in the above statements.</p>\n<p>Oh yes: and they’re going to improve communications; but they announced all the above without the vaguest hint of consultation with the staff.  No, wait, this is management-speak: “communication” means “We will communicate at you”.</p>\n<p>And on that note, all this is being badged the “Step-Change Program”.  Now I don’t know about you, but to me a step-change sounds like quite a small thing; like a stepper-motor in electronics, maybe, or just the first steps of a child.  Apparently not to management.  In management-speak, our new boss (same as the boss before the current one, as it happens) tells us, “step” means “huge”.</p>\n<p>Do what you want with the company, guys: but give us our language back.</p>\n<hr>\n<sup><a name=\"2002-02-26foot1\" id=\"step-change-foot1\">*</a></sup> Or is it?  Perhaps we should have a poll.\n</body></html>\n",

See the band’s blog at </lj><lj user=\"tickettothewest\"> for blow-by-blow details (with pictures), but here’s my take on it.</lj></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>We were up till one on Friday night doing initial setup and soundcheck for my guitar.  Got my rhythm (god, that’s a stupid word to spell; I always take about three goes, and it still never looks right) guitar for ‘Naples’  down in the first hour or so on Saturday morning.  There’s a part in it where all of us are having difficulty locking into the beat correctly (note how I avoided using that word again).  This was where <lj user=\"swisstone\"> demonstrated that a drumstick could become a conductor’s baton.   All these years we thought he was air-drumming, and here he was really practising to be a conductor.</lj></p>\n<p>Actually it was very helpful.</p>\n<p>We then decided we needed a different sound for the next song, ‘Massachusetts Avenue’.  And spent the next hour playing with gain and EQ controls until we had it right.  Karmic is nothing if not a perfectionist, and I’m sure we’ll thank him for it when we hear the final results.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we were able to use the same sound for the third song, ‘Cowboys and Indians’, and it went down without too much fuss, leaving us only to choose a suitable clean sound for ‘White Line’.  That didn’t take too long,and before the night was out Ol, the lead guitarist (and sole non-LJ user in the band, I might add) had done his rhythm part on the last song.</p>\n<p>The next day he did all his other rhythm parts, and in the afternoon I started singing.</p>\n<p>That’s when we discovered all the parts in the songs where I had been getting it wrong up until now.  I didn’t write any of the songs we’re recording at the moment, so there’s always someone else to know what I’m doing wrong (in many ways this makes it easier for me than doing my own songs, when there’s only me who knows what I should be singing); however, it’s not always easy to catch such things in a rehearsal when everyone is playing.</p>\n<p>Still, as <lj user=\"zotz\"> said, taking two hours to record the entire lead vocal for a track is not, in the grand scheme of things, that much.</lj></p>\n<p>In the end, though, we only managed to finish three of the four tracks before we all had to go home, so ‘Naples’ remains undone as yet.</p>\n<p>And in the middle of all that we heard the tragic news about <i>Columbia</i>.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I was cycling to Waterloo this morning, on my brand-new, four-month old <a href=\"http://www.ridgebackbikes.co.uk/\">Ridgeback</a> bike, when all of a sudden something began to drag badly on the back wheel.  I got off, had a good look, up-ended it, and saw that the tyre was rubbing against the mudguard bracket, once per turn.</p>\n<p>I tried slackening the wheel and re-seating it, but that didn’t help.  The mudguard bracket wasn’t bent or anything.  I gradually realised that the wheel was out of true.</p>\n<p>But it had happened in an instant; I had heard the change, just as I went over a speed bump.  Surely wheels only get warped over a long period of time?</p>\n<p>A few more minutes of examination revealed the culprit: a spoke had broken.  The careful balance of tension that makes a bike wheel the perfect, dynamically stable circle that it is, had gone, throwing all out of alignment.  I feel there should be some sort of metaphor here, perhaps for world affairs; but this isn’t <i>Thought for the Day</i>.</p>\n<p>So I was left to take it easy the rest of the way to Waterloo,  and I’ll have to struggle home somehow.</p>\n<p>Fortunately (I suppose) the bike is overdue for its first free service, so I’ll take it into <a href=\"http://www.londonfieldscycles.co.uk/\">the shop</a> and I’m sure they’ll sort it out.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>It’s a truism that time appears to pass faster as we get older.  Just how true this is was brought home to me anew when it crossed my mind that I had, a while ago, been thinking about writing a piece with a similar title to the above.</p>\n<p>Then I realised that I had been thinking about it around <i>last</i> New Year.  Yet it felt to me like it had been no more than a few weeks before.</p>\n<p>Then on Radio 4′s <i>Today</i> program, before I left for work this morning, they were doing a piece on time-saving devices, and how some people think that they don’t save us time, but merely free us to waste it in new ways.  And how we’ve lost the sense of <strong>process</strong>.</p>\n<p>To paraphrase:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We travel only to be at our destination, not to experience the journey; we treat food as something to eat, not something to cook; we wash merely to have clean clothes or dishes, not to get them clean.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which is all very well, but what exactly is the problem with that?   Especially in the case of the last point: I’d say, “Damn right” to that one  The single best household good we ever bought was the dishwasher.</p>\n<p>As for travelling, well <strong> of course </strong> we do it to be at the other place.  For example, I went to <lj user=\"karmicnull\">‘s with Frances and the kids for New Year, and the purpose of the travelling was only so that we could be with our friends.  If I could have stepped onto a transporter platform and beamed there in an instant I’d certainly have done so in preference to experiencing the dubious pleasures of the rain-drenched M11.</lj></p>\n<p>On the other hand, I do enjoy cooking, but what with work and kids and <nobr><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=tickettothewest\"><img height=\"17\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" width=\"17\"></a><b><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/tickettothewest/\">band</a></b></nobr> there’s little enough time for home life.  And at the same time, it’s slightly ironic that they should run that piece just a week after many if not most people in the country have spent a day cooking (or helping to cook) the biggest meal of the year.</p>\n<p>Here’s a thought: if, on Christmas Day, you could press a button and instantly have a classic Christmas dinner ready, with no preparations and no cooking, would you?  I think I probably wouldn’t.  Because part of the whole Christmas experience is the preparation and cooking.</p>\n<p>Though I would certainly use such a magic button at other times…</p>\n<p>With the year-change bringing thoughts of time, the other time-related quote I was thinking of using as a title was, “Time takes a cigarette”, from Bowie’s<br>\n‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Suicide’.  Then what do they go and use as part of the backing for the Radio 4 piece?  Plagiarists!</p>\n<p>It was an interesting piece, though, and I would have liked to listen to all of it; but I was already late leaving, and so (of course) I didn’t have time.</p>\n<p>And last year’s piece?  Inevitably I never found the time to write it.</p>\n<p>\nIn a nice touch of real-world LiveJournal linking, just after the year turned at Si’s, we got a phone call from <lj user=\"swisstone\">.  Which was nice.<br>\n<br></lj></p>\n</body></html>\n",

On leaving work I noticed what I thought was one of the many casual misspellings that haunt our public spaces.  In this case it was on a London Borough of Merton electronic noticeboard by Wimbledon station.  “Run with the Wimbledon Windmilers”, it said, and I wondered whether it was a pun on the distance they run.  Wimbledon has a windmill, though, and I somehow doubted that members of an athletic organisation would be that keen on wordplay.  A quick websearch showed me that <a href=\"http://www.windmilers.org.uk/\">I was wrong</a>, though.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I imagined a literate member of the organisation complaining about it to their colleagues, and being told, “It doesn’t matter: it’s only a word”.</p>\n<p>But it’s their name.  And names matter.  Words matter (the fact that I was mistaken, and there was no misspelling doesn’t matter, for the sake of this argument).</p>\n<p>So when <strong>should</strong> we let the Saatchis — or at least their name — back into polite society?  It’s hard to say; and not an immediately pressing matter, as I have no particular desire to visit their gallery, nor a need for an ad agency.</p>\n<p>It’s not like that first time I bought South African wine after apartheid ended.  That was both difficult, and positive.  Difficult because I had developed such an ingrained reaction against South African goods; and positive because I could feel I was supporting the new regime.</p>\n<p>That, of course, was several orders of magnitude more significant than the doings of a seedy little political party and their advertising lapdogs (hmm, I wonder whether the lapdog relationship was actually the other way round?)</p>\n<p>I suppose, though, if it comes to making the decision, I should ask myself, “What would Iain Banks do?”</p>\n<p><font size=\"-1\"><br>\n<a name=\"foot1\">[1]</a> Though I have to admit to doubting my memory when I find that Google can find no record of this event, either on the web or on Usenet.

A rainy Monday in July, and it was packed. The Barbenheimer effect, of course. But I was there on the first weekend of Black Panther, I was at the opening night of the last Star Wars movie‚Ä¶ Neither was as busy as this.</p><p>Oppenheimer was incredible. Hard to make out the dialogue, at times, of course, You expect that from Nolan, and we've maybe got worse at listening to screened entertainment, due to nearly always having the subtitles on at home.</p><p>But I didn't feel I missed anything too significant.Oppenheimer's story is quite incredible. I had the vague impression, since I knew only that he'd been instrumental in the Manhattan project, that he was more experimenter than theoretician, maybe an engineer, rather than a physicist. But it turns out (assuming the film and the book it's based on are right) that he was very much a theoretical physicist ‚Äî even theorising about black holes ‚Äî and very much not an experimentalist.</p><p>Later 'more politician now than scientist', as one of the many other characters says. And those other characters: so many names from the history of physics, many with parts so small you don't even realise they were there till you look at the cast list. Feynman, for example.</p><p>Heisenberg (I didn't know his politics were so uncertain); Bohr. Einstein, obviously, though he wasn't involved in the Manhattan Project.</p><p>Artistic license: how far were they from the trinity bomb, the initial test detonation? The longest distance they mentioned was twenty miles, for the longest-distance observers, and the closest 1000 yards. That must have been the blast radius, though: there's no way anyone was that close!</p><p>But as represented, the time between the light and the sound seemed ridiculously long. It created quite a chilling effect, though: I may never have experienced such a silence in a cinema.</p><p>Good film, would watch again. Preferably with subtititles.</p>\n",

Everyday problems of relationships and such are part of it. The boyfriend of one of the sisters is a ghost.\n\nI enjoyed it, and will probably read the sequel, which is out. My main problem with it was that the four sisters' voices weren't distinctive enough. The story is told from their multiple viewpoints. This is helpful to me, because it's something I'm struggling with myself. Indeed, my [supervisor](/categories/cwma/) suggested that maybe I shouldn't have so many viewpoints. \n\nThree. I have three. Hands up who thinks that's too many?\n",

				"content_html": "<p>We subscribed to Disney+ last night, so that we could watch Peter Jackson&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Beatles: Get Back<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I had thought it was going to be a movie, but it turns out it&rsquo;s a miniseries: three two-hour episodes. The second drops today, and the third tomorrow.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s built from hours of footage that were recorded for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let It Be<!-- raw HTML omitted --> documentary back in 1969. I remember watching that once and being disappointed by it. The main problem was that it was presented as a fly-on-the-wall thing, but the fly was aurally challenged.</p>\n<p>In other words, you couldn&rsquo;t make out much of the chatter between the guys. That, almost as much as hearing them rehearsing and working on the songs, was kind of the point.</p>\n<p>If you were making a documentary like that today you&rsquo;d probably have all the band members wearing microphone packs, as the participants in reality TV shows do, so that what they said would make it to storage. Back then, though, even if that had been practical,<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> it was far from obvious that the individual Beatles would all have complied.

So of course, the original producers relied on ambient miking. It&rsquo;s fine when the speaker is near one of the vocal mics, or when they&rsquo;re right under a boom, but otherwise‚Ä¶ well, as I say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let It Be<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was a frustrating experience.</p>\n<p>However, technology has come a long, long, way in the succeeding fifty years. Every word in this is clear as a bell,<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> undoubtedly with the help of modern digital audio editing. It&rsquo;s slightly ironic to note that one of the first things the band say is that the place they&rsquo;re working in &ndash; a warehouse in Twickenham &ndash; is acoustically bad. An odd choice of a place in which to work on writing and performing songs.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as of the cliffhanger ending of episode one, this series is <em>fucking amazing</em>! Totally brilliant!</p>\n<p>But only if you&rsquo;re a fan. If you only take a passing interest in The Beatles, or (weirdly) none at all, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t waste your time on this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-disneyfication-of-christmas\">The Disneyfication of Christmas</h2>\n<p>Disney have made a genius move in launching this when they did. We will be far, far, from the only people who took out a subscription to watch this, with the intention of cancelling it after a month.</p>\n<p>A month. What&rsquo;s a month after yesterday, the 25th of November? Oh yes.</p>\n<p>All those subscriptions that are due to renew on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day? So many of them won&rsquo;t be cancelled, either just to have things to watch over Christmas, or to keep the kids happy, or because people will forget with everything else going on.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll probably try to catch up on some of the newer Marvel and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stuff, of which there is just far, far, too much now, in my humble opinion.</p>\n<p>But there&rsquo;s not too much Beatles.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t, because they would have had to be wired microphones&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking here.

I had thought it was going to be a movie, but it turns out it's a miniseries: three two-hour episodes. The second drops today, and the third tomorrow.\n\nIt's built from hours of footage that were recorded for the <cite>Let It Be</cite> documentary back in 1969. I remember watching that once and being disappointed by it. The main problem was that it was presented as a fly-on-the-wall thing, but the fly was aurally challenged.\n\nIn other words, you couldn't make out much of the chatter between the guys. That, almost as much as hearing them rehearsing and working on the songs, was kind of the point.\n\nIf you were making a documentary like that today you'd probably have all the band members wearing microphone packs, as the participants in reality TV shows do, so that what they said would make it to storage. Back then, though, even if that had been practical,[^microphones] it was far from obvious that the individual Beatles would all have complied. Plus we'd want to hear from [Brian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Epstein),[^brian] and [Mal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Evans), and [Glyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyn_Johns), and [the other George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin), as well as John, Paul, George, and Ringo.\n\nThat's a lot of microphone packs. So of course, the original producers relied on ambient miking. It's fine when the speaker is near one of the vocal mics, or when they're right under a boom, but otherwise‚Ä¶ well, as I say, <cite>Let It Be</cite> was a frustrating experience.\n\nHowever, technology has come a long, long, way in the succeeding fifty years. Every word in this is clear as a bell,[^Scouse] undoubtedly with the help of modern digital audio editing. It's slightly ironic to note that one of the first things the band say is that the place they're working in -- a warehouse in Twickenham -- is acoustically bad. An odd choice of a place in which to work on writing and performing songs.\n\nAnyway, as of the cliffhanger ending of episode one, this series is _fucking amazing_! Totally brilliant!\n\nBut only if you're a fan. If you only take a passing interest in The Beatles, or (weirdly) none at all, you probably shouldn't waste your time on this.\n\n## The Disneyfication of Christmas\n\nDisney have made a genius move in launching this when they did. We will be far, far, from the only people who took out a subscription to watch this, with the intention of cancelling it after a month.\n\nA month. What's a month after yesterday, the 25th of November? Oh yes.\n\nAll those subscriptions that are due to renew on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day? So many of them won't be cancelled, either just to have things to watch over Christmas, or to keep the kids happy, or because people will forget with everything else going on.\n\nI don't mind, I'll probably try to catch up on some of the newer Marvel and <cite>Star Wars</cite> stuff, of which there is just far, far, too much now, in my humble opinion.\n\nBut there's not too much Beatles.\n\n[^microphones]: It wouldn't, because they would have had to be wired microphones\n\n[^Scouse]: The odd line is given a subtitle, but I think those are more about Scouse accents than inaudibility.\n\n[^brian]: I don't know what I was thinking here. Obviously Brian Epstein was dead by 1969 and isn't in the film. My thanks to [Tony](https://tonykeen.blogspot.com) for pointing this out. \n",

				"content_text": "<p><p><img src=\"uploads/2022/64e6031bb9.jpg\" /></p> <p>This film is infuriating. It reminded me of <em>Shallow Grave</em>, at least at the start, in this way: if you find a load of money that's obviously come from a drug deal gone wrong, or otherwise somehow involved in organised crime, there is one thing you should <em>not</em> do. That is try it keep it all, to run away with it or hide it, and expect to survive the wrath of the criminals.</p><p>The safest thing, of course, is to just walk away from it all and call the cops. But if you must get into it, then obviously what you should do is take <em>some</em> of the money. Not a lot. Say, 10%. An amount that the gangsters might plausibly accept as having gone missing during the the shootout, or whatever. Leave the rest, call the cops, and let them handle the aftermath. You might get away with it.</p><p>Here, the main character does exactly the wrong thing. What's worse, in story terms, is that from the start we have no one to identify with: no character who is obviously the 'hero,' if you like. No one to root for. Because it all starts off without us having any particular reason to root for Llewelyn. And as it goes on, and we do start to want him to make it ‚Äî if only because the focus is mainly on him ‚Äî he continues to annoyingly make terrible choices.</p><p>Worse still -- and spoilers ahead -- worse still, his story is just dropped on the floor. He doesn't even get the respect of us seeing his end. The narrative hands over to a secondary character (though to be fair, that character, the sheriff, is the first character we meet, if only in voiceover).</p><p>And the end is just... nothing.¬†</p><p>It is by far my least favourite Coen brothers film.</p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/devilgate/film/no-country-for-old-men/\">See in Letterboxd</a></p>\n",

It suggests that, last year in spring and early summer, people were scared to go out, not just into the streets, into shops, but into their own gardens.\n\nNo one caught Covid over a garden fence. Or so I imagine. At the same time, it didn't hurt to be cautious.\n\n",

As I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2021/05/26/the-illuminatus-trilogy-by-robert-shea-and-robert-anton-wilson-books-2021-8/\" rel=\"nofollow\">last post</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Wendell_Thornley\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kerry Thornley</a> of Discordian fame is interviewed early in it. That is, an interview with him is used. He‚Äôs dead, so it‚Äôs not like he was interviewed for these films. Indeed, as far as I can tell, nothing was shot for these films: the visuals are entirely comprised of library footage.</p>\n<p>Curtis narrates over them ‚Äî sometimes with quite a disconnected effect, where the images have no obvious connection to the story he‚Äôs telling. Similarly, the use of music can be quite jarring. Sometimes it‚Äôs completely relevant to the matter at hand, but often there‚Äôs no obvious connection. And the titular Kylie song is not used at all.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not even that obvious why the series is called that, come to think of it. And some of the individual episode titles are even more opaque, notably the last one: ‚ÄòAre We Pigeon or are We Dancer?‚Äô I feel sure it‚Äôs a quote, and I think it‚Äôs probably from a song, but I was alert to it turning up, and as far as I could tell, it didn‚Äôt.</p>\n<p>OK, a quick <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%27Are+We+Pigeon+or+are+We+Dancer%3F%27\" rel=\"nofollow\"> DuckDuck </a> gives mainly hits about the episode, but also some about <a href=\"https://www.gigwise.com/news/47201/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a track by The Killers</a> called ‚ÄòHuman,‚Äô which includes the line ‚Äòare we human or are we dancer?‚Äô So it‚Äôs probably alluding to that. Oddly that line is inspired by a Hunter S Thompson quote that I‚Äôm not familiar with, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre raising a generation of dancers.‚Äô Which sounds pretty good to me, even if Hunter meant it critically.</p>\n<p>Anyway, what‚Äôs this absurdly long film <em>about</em>?</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a bleak, depressing, but nonetheless compelling vision of human history, covering conspiracies and conspiracy theories, wars, revolution, surveillance capitalism, and capitalism more broadly, the tension between the collective and the individual, and a whole hell of a lot more.</p>\n<p>But Curtis never gives a thesis statement. He never tells us, in the news journalist‚Äôs way, what he‚Äôs going to tell us. Or more to the point, what conclusions he‚Äôs going to draw from what he‚Äôs going to tell us.

There, I was bothered by it not being based on the standard, open protocols that underlie email, at least to the extent that you can't get your Hey email using a third-party, standard client.\n\nOnMail seems both visually and functionally similar to Hey, and it's got exactly the same problem.\n\nThis trend is bad for email, bad for people who use email. It should be possible to give us the kind of powerful, automated controls over our inboxes that these services offer, _without_ stopping us from using the apps we prefer. It _is_ possible to do that, as companies like [SaneBox](https://www.sanebox.com) show.\n\nI do not like this trend.\n\n[^bbk]: Oddly, I had this expectation confounded just today, when Birkbeck's submissions system didn't send me any confirmations about the pieces that I submitted for assessment.\n",

It&rsquo;s about reading.</p>\n<p>How long should we give a book by even a beloved author, before giving up on it, if we are not enjoying it?</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s relatively rare for me not to finish a book that I start.

And there&rsquo;s the odd other one I&rsquo;ve abandoned. One that I accidentally left on a train, and realised I didn&rsquo;t care. It was something to do with an excise inspector in Scotland.

Overcoming that challenge can be rewarding, but we should never feel guilty about abandoning them if we&rsquo;re not enjoying them, I feel. Reading for pleasure should not be a chore.</p>\n<p>But now we come to a strange case. Claire North is an author I like a lot. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <a href=\"/blog/2015/03/06/the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august-by-claire-north-books-2015-2/\">was great</a>, and so was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Touch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which <a href=\"/blog/2019/07/14/cite-touch-cite-by-claire-north-books-2019-8/\">I read</a> the last time I was out of the country.</p>\n<p>So I was pleased to get her <!-- raw HTML omitted -->84k<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for Christmas. And I&rsquo;ve tried to read it twice, but I just can&rsquo;t get into it. It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s boring or hard to read.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s <em>unpleasant</em>.</p>\n<p>That probably doesn&rsquo;t make a huge amount of sense.

				"content_text": "\n\nThis is not, as you might have guessed from the title, about writing. It's about reading.\n\nHow long should we give a book by even a beloved author, before giving up on it, if we are not enjoying it?\n\nIt's relatively rare for me not to finish a book that I start. There are a few that I took a couple of runs at, having to start again -- <cite>Ulysses</cite> springs to mind. And some that I haven't finished, and would have to start again: <cite>Gravity's Rainbow</cite>, <cite>Swann's Way</cite>. I might never bother with either of those again, but you never know.\n\nI'm fairly sure I'll never get further than the the two or three pages I've managed into <cite>Finnegan's Wake</cite>. And there's the odd other one I've abandoned. One that I accidentally left on a train, and realised I didn't care. It was something to do with an excise inspector in Scotland. No idea what it was called or who it was by.\n\nMost of those above are what people would call _difficult_: something about the style, form, or content makes reading them a challenge. Overcoming that challenge can be rewarding, but we should never feel guilty about abandoning them if we're not enjoying them, I feel. Reading for pleasure should not be a chore.\n\nBut now we come to a strange case. Claire North is an author I like a lot. <cite>The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August</cite> [was great](/blog/2015/03/06/the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august-by-claire-north-books-2015-2/), and so was <cite>Touch</cite>, which [I read](/blog/2019/07/14/cite-touch-cite-by-claire-north-books-2019-8/) the last time I was out of the country.\n\nSo I was pleased to get her <cite>84k</cite> for Christmas. And I've tried to read it twice, but I just can't get into it. It's not that it's boring or hard to read.\n\nIt's that it's _unpleasant_.\n\nThat probably doesn't make a huge amount of sense. Lots of books have unpleasant characters, or depict upsetting or hurtful events. Lots of _entertainment_ shows those things, TV, movies, songs... \n\nI have [mentioned here before](/blog/2018/08/16/gilded-cage-tarnished-city-and-bright-ruin-by-vic-james-books-2018-21-22-23/) that I don't really care for dystopias as a subgenre.[^dystopias] I'm not sure I can easily explain why that is, but they just don't appeal.\n\nAnd this is set in one. It's largely a version of Britain, more or less present-day, but things have gone so far into privatisation, rampant capitalism, and generally Conservative party policies, that everyone knows the value of a human life.\n\nThat's what the title means. That's how much, in pounds, the rich have to pay to get away with murder. They can do anything else they want, too, as long as they can afford it.\n\nI'm sure it will have a positive, maybe even uplifting, outcome. But I won't be carrying on with it. I got about thirty pages in on my second time of starting it (only a couple the first time), and it's just too bleak, too grim, for me to want to spend any more time there.\n\nMaybe it's partly the times were living in. But it's not for me.\n\n\n\n[^dystopias]: If that's the right thing to call them.\n\n",

It&rsquo;s from a site called <a href=\"https://www.rosart.nl/\">The Rosart Project</a>, set up by some students of typography.</p>\n<p>Rendle&rsquo;s essay at an improved version of that sentence is this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Type designers will often look at letterforms that were made in the past and then redraw them for modern day use. This is called a ‚Äúrevival‚Äù by the type community but I like to think of it as a remix: a type designer will unavoidably apply their own style and harmonies, their own deviations and melodies to the song.</p>\n<p>Every remix is different, every remix is important.</p>\n<p>&ndash; Robin Rendle, <a href=\"http://robinrendle.com/notes/writing-about-typography.html\">Writing about Typography</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is certainly brighter, has a bit more sparkle, and arguably is easier to understand. But I don&rsquo;t think the original is <em>that</em> bad. Certainly not as bad as Rendle thinks. He says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>what does any of this mean? The words make sense but it‚Äôs written in a style that‚Äôs familiar to anyone that reads about the field of typography. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs known to folks outside the field as ‚Äúacademic writing‚Äù but it‚Äôs what I consider to simply be bad writing‚Äîit‚Äôs waffling and unclear.</p>\n<p>&ndash; Robin Rendle, <a href=\"http://robinrendle.com/notes/writing-about-typography.html\">Writing about Typography</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s what is often called <em>dry</em>, I&rsquo;d say, certainly compared to the alternative. But I don&rsquo;t think it deserves quite the fire he brings to it. Of course he&rsquo;s only doing it &ndash; he says, and I believe him &ndash; because he loves the project, and wants to &lsquo;see the whole typographic community break the shackles of this style of writing.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Which is fair enough. I&rsquo;d certainly rather read a piece in Rendle&rsquo;s style than much academic writing. So I guess maybe I do agree with him after all. His final advice to the typographic community could apply just about anywhere where words are used:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>write to swoon, to convince, to make a stranger fall in love. Abandon the academic style, because it‚Äôs making your beautiful work so very boring.</p>\n<p>&ndash; Robin Rendle, <a href=\"http://robinrendle.com/notes/writing-about-typography.html\">Writing about Typography</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n",

It's from a site called [The Rosart Project](https://www.rosart.nl/), set up by some students of typography.\n\nRendle's essay at an improved version of that sentence is this:\n\n> Type designers will often look at letterforms that were made in the past and then redraw them for modern day use. This is called a ‚Äúrevival‚Äù by the type community but I like to think of it as a remix: a type designer will unavoidably apply their own style and harmonies, their own deviations and melodies to the song.\n>\n> Every remix is different, every remix is important.\n> \n> -- Robin Rendle, [Writing about Typography](http://robinrendle.com/notes/writing-about-typography.html)\n\nWhich is certainly brighter, has a bit more sparkle, and arguably is easier to understand. But I don't think the original is _that_ bad. Certainly not as bad as Rendle thinks. He says: \n\n> what does any of this mean? The words make sense but it‚Äôs written in a style that‚Äôs familiar to anyone that reads about the field of typography. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs known to folks outside the field as ‚Äúacademic writing‚Äù but it‚Äôs what I consider to simply be bad writing‚Äîit‚Äôs waffling and unclear.\n> \n> -- Robin Rendle, [Writing about Typography](http://robinrendle.com/notes/writing-about-typography.html)\n\nIt's what is often called _dry_, I'd say, certainly compared to the alternative. But I don't think it deserves quite the fire he brings to it. Of course he's only doing it -- he says, and I believe him -- because he loves the project, and wants to 'see the whole typographic community break the shackles of this style of writing.'\n\nWhich is fair enough. I'd certainly rather read a piece in Rendle's style than much academic writing. So I guess maybe I do agree with him after all. His final advice to the typographic community could apply just about anywhere where words are used:\n\n> write to swoon, to convince, to make a stranger fall in love. Abandon the academic style, because it‚Äôs making your beautiful work so very boring.\n> \n> -- Robin Rendle, [Writing about Typography](http://robinrendle.com/notes/writing-about-typography.html)\n\n",

Sounds like an interesting book, and the review itself is engaging.

It's based visually on another theme, called [zen-jinja](https://themes.getnikola.com/v8/zen-jinja/), but I made a lot of changes to the CSS.\n\n## The Nikola Micro Plugin\n\nNikola provides a command-line tool for creating posts: `nikola new_post`. But that makes you enter a title. You can tweak things afterwards to remove the title, but if you know up front that your post won't have one, you can now use my 'Micro' plugin, by running `nikola micro`. The [details are here](https://plugins.getnikola.com/v8/micro/) in the [plugin repository](https://plugins.getnikola.com).\n\n",

That may have been signalled by the recent decision to cut 180 jobs (or 12% of its UK workforce) as a result of Covid.\n<br />\n...\n<br />\nBut, tellingly, newsstand print sales, at ¬£49.3m, were 50% down compared with 2016. Last year, print accounted for 42% of revenue (¬£94 million) and an estimated ¬£75 million of production, distribution and marketing costs.

Much of the experience (especially of the Newhouse family‚Äôs Advance newspaper group in the US) seems to show that reducing the daily frequency seldom works: once the daily habit is broken, newspaper buyers quickly seem to stop buying the paper altogether. A consolation print option could be the expansion of the 101-year-old news magazine Guardian Weekly which claims readers in more than 170 countries.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\nI'd guess they'll maybe keep <cite>The Observer</cite> going for a while: Sunday papers have their own distinct identities.\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"The Guardian to end print? - Flashes & Flames\" data-author=\"\" cite=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">\nThe contrast with digital could not be greater. The Guardian has 160 million monthly uniques across the world, some 25% in the UK. More striking, though, are those digital editions in North America and Australia/New Zealand which, respectively, have advertising revenue of ¬£25 million and ¬£11 million. These are now strong operations, evidenced by Australia where The Guardian is the fourth largest online news service with an audience of 11.6 million (more than 50% of the adult population) ‚Äì ahead of News Corp‚Äôs national daily, The Australian.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\nGood to know it's beating Murdoch on his home turf.\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"The Guardian to end print? - Flashes & Flames\" data-author=\"\" cite=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">\nHarvard‚Äôs Nieman Journalism Lab describes The Guardian as ‚Äúa weird newspaper‚Äù because: it has nearly two-thirds of its readers coming from outside its own country; started in one city and moved to another; and is owned by a trust that mandates it promotes liberal journalism in Britain and elsewhere.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n\"A weird newspaper\": works for me.\n\n\n\n",

It's a story set in Victorian times, about two men living Baker Street in London; one a detective, the other a doctor.\n\nBut the detective is an angel, called Crow; and the doctor is JH Doyle, recently back from Afghanistan, where he was injured in an encounter with one of the Fallen.

James Moriarty can't enter your home unless you invite him. But werewolves are respected landlords.\n\nVampires can enter public buildings, of course: \"Any building with an angel.\" Angels only have consciousness and names -- names are important -- if they are attached to a public building. Churches and synagogues have their angels, obviously; but so too do pubs, hotels, and stations. The angel of King's Cross makes an appearance.\n\nBut not the angel I was half expecting. The Angel, Islington is a pub,[^neverSpoons] and we'd have to refer to its angel as 'The Angel of the Angel, Islington,' which would be weird and unwieldy.\n\nSpeaking of language, the Victorianism is handled pretty well, I think, but the author is American, and it shows where a few terms creep in. 'Sidewalk' instead of 'pavement'; 'baseboard' instead of 'skirting board.' 'Row houses' where we would say 'terraced houses.' 'Sundown.' 'Paper folded into fourths'; a British writer would say 'quarters.'\n\nThese are mildly jarring, but not that important. Certainly not enough to detract from the fun of the story overall.\n\n[^neverSpoons]: Sadly now a Wetherspoons. [#NeverSpoons](https://www.tweet247.net/united%20kingdom/neverspoons).\n\n",

At the time of writing, we don't know whether or not it will win.\n\nUnless I've travelled downthread and found out.\n\nIt's a novella, which may be the perfect length of story, in some sense. It's a love story across time and space and multiple parallel existences... It's pure dead brilliant. \n\nThe actual nature of the war, of the sides, even of the protagonists, Red and Blue, is ambiguous at best. But that doesn't matter because the writing is so exquisite. \n\nThe [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_How_You_Lose_the_Time_War) describes it as an epistolary novel. That's only partly true, and not just because it's a novella. The letters are there, and are fundamental, but I feel that to be truly 'epistolary,' the whole story must be told in letters, and that is not the case here. But that doesn't matter.\n\nOne minor oddity I alluded to above: The future is referred to as 'downthread' and the past 'upthread.' That seems the wrong way round to me, but maybe it reflects the fact that, normally, we can't stop sliding down into the future.\n\nGo. Get. Read. VVG. They're adapting it for TV.

She was 81. That's not a bad age, and it's not like I had followed her career. I just knew her as a photographer who had worked with The Beatles, and been Stuart Sutcliffe's partner till he died.\n\nBut from my early reading of Beatles books -- like [<cite>The Beatles: An Illustrated Record</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_An_Illustrated_Record) -- onward, I was aware of her as part of their story, their mythology. \n\nMore than that, though, as the article above, as well as [her obituary](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/17/astrid-kirchherr-obituary), will tell you: she was the one who gave them their early look. She made them the \"lovable moptops.\" They'd have been successful without the haircuts, of course, but there's no denying the importance of that early image.\n\nI think I'm saddened more because of what her death represents. I was born the year The Beatles took America. They had long split up by the time I developed any musical awareness.[^swearingatgran] But they were the first band I really got interested in, when my sister gave me a tape. They were my favourites until punk came along, and I love them still.\n\nBut that whole generation is ageing -- well, who isn't, of course -- and will soon be gone. And mine not too far behind it. So what it all comes down to is that Astrid's death reminds me of my own mortality, and there's no excuse for that!\n\n[Brilliant photos](https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp84332/astrid-kirchherr), though.\t\n\n[^sp]: I note that I always thought her name was Kirchnerr. But there's no \"n\" to be found.\n\n[^swearingatgran]: Though I did shock my grandma when I was very small, by singing \"Obla-di, Obla-da.\" She thought I was \"swearing\". And it might have been The Marmalade's version that I'd heard at that time.\n\n",

				"content_text": "\n\nI'm almost beginning to wish I hadn't switched my site to static generation. Not really, though. I'm very pleased with the way the site is performing, with how it looks, and with how easy it is to change things.\n\nIt's just the _non_-static parts that I want to get working that are complex. By which I mean comments, of course, and Webmentions.\n\nComments are obvious. And the \"obvious\" way to make them work with a static site -- and one that has good support built into [Nikola](https://getnikola.com), the generator application I'm using -- is [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). But Disqus is known to track its users and show ads, and I don't want that for anyone who might comment here.\n\nSo I've been trying other options. But none of them work as easily as you'd hope. There are always complexities, difficulties, bits you have to glue together or even build yourself.\n\nSo far I've tried: \n\n- [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/): you have to run a service on your site.

Everything should go on working, but comments will disappear for a while.</p>\n<h2 id=\"details\">Details</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m changing both the server my site runs on, and the way it&rsquo;s built. I&rsquo;ve been using <a href=\"https://wordpress.org\">WordPress</a> for the blog since I started it in 2006 (before that I used <a href=\"https://www.livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a>, and at some point I imported those posts, so the earliest entries go back to 2002). Just recently, though, I started having a problem with it.</p>\n<p>Everything was still running OK, but I couldn&rsquo;t post to it from external sources. So I couldn&rsquo;t use <a href=\"https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/\">MarsEdit</a>, which is my preferred way to post, or the <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> app for status updates, or even services like <a href=\"https://ifttt.com\">IFTTT</a>, which has been adding notes and ratings for all the films I&rsquo;ve watched over the last few months, from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/devilgate/films/diary/\">Letterboxd</a>.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure I could have tracked down the cause and fixed it. But then there&rsquo;s also the fact that I recently got round to upgrading to WordPress 5<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. I had avoided that because I didn&rsquo;t like the new editor <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/09/02/4985/\">when I tried it out before</a>. I don&rsquo;t know quite why, but eventually I bit the bullet and upgraded.</p>\n<p>And I hate it. I never really cared for the online editing experience at the best of times, which is part of the reason I preferred using MarsEdit. But I just have a visceral bad reaction to the new editor.</p>\n<p>Add to that that static sites are a) much faster to serve and b) what &ldquo;all the cool kids&rdquo; are using nowadays. I started to look into moving to a static site.</p>\n<p>The two big players here are Jekyll and Hugo. I&rsquo;ve used Jekyll before, when I was at SAHSU. The <a href=\"https://smallareahealthstatisticsunit.github.io/rapidInquiryFacility/\">documentation for the RIF</a><sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> is hosted at GitHub Pages, and that uses Jekyll, so it&rsquo;s worth having a local implementation for testing, which I did.</p>\n<p>But as a programmer, there can be times when you want to change the tools you use. Jekyll is written in Ruby; Hugo is in Go. I don&rsquo;t know either of those, and while I like learning new languages, that wasn&rsquo;t the purpose of this exercise.</p>\n<p>In short, I wanted something that is written in Python, and I found it in <a href=\"https://getnikola.com/\">Nikola</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> For reasons too boring to explain, I had trouble with it on my existing server, so I&rsquo;ve set up a new one at <a href=\"https://www.linode.com\">Linode</a>. I&rsquo;ll be switching over to it later today. You shouldn&rsquo;t see any changes, except:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All the comments on the blog will disappear. They&rsquo;re not lost, and I plan to get them back, but I need to find the best way to do that. For now, comment via Twitter or Micro.blog.</li>\n<li>The Atom feed may be broken. I&rsquo;ll try to get that fixed. The RSS feed should still be fine, and at the same location as before.

				"content_text": "\n\n## Abstract/TL;DR\n\nI'm changing my site. Everything should go on working, but comments will disappear for a while.\n\n## Details\n\nI'm changing both the server my site runs on, and the way it's built. I've been using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) for the blog since I started it in 2006 (before that I used [LiveJournal](https://www.livejournal.com), and at some point I imported those posts, so the earliest entries go back to 2002). Just recently, though, I started having a problem with it.\n\nEverything was still running OK, but I couldn't post to it from external sources. So I couldn't use [MarsEdit](https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/), which is my preferred way to post, or the [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) app for status updates, or even services like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com), which has been adding notes and ratings for all the films I've watched over the last few months, from [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/devilgate/films/diary/).\n\nI'm sure I could have tracked down the cause and fixed it. But then there's also the fact that I recently got round to upgrading to WordPress 5[^wp5]. I had avoided that because I didn't like the new editor [when I tried it out before](https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/09/02/4985/). I don't know quite why, but eventually I bit the bullet and upgraded.\n\nAnd I hate it. I never really cared for the online editing experience at the best of times, which is part of the reason I preferred using MarsEdit. But I just have a visceral bad reaction to the new editor.\n\nAdd to that that static sites are a) much faster to serve and b) what \"all the cool kids\" are using nowadays. I started to look into moving to a static site.\n\nThe two big players here are Jekyll and Hugo. I've used Jekyll before, when I was at SAHSU. The [documentation for the RIF](https://smallareahealthstatisticsunit.github.io/rapidInquiryFacility/)[^rif] is hosted at GitHub Pages, and that uses Jekyll, so it's worth having a local implementation for testing, which I did.\n\nBut as a programmer, there can be times when you want to change the tools you use. Jekyll is written in Ruby; Hugo is in Go. I don't know either of those, and while I like learning new languages, that wasn't the purpose of this exercise. \n\nIn short, I wanted something that is written in Python, and I found it in [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/).[^tesla] For reasons too boring to explain, I had trouble with it on my existing server, so I've set up a new one at [Linode](https://www.linode.com). I'll be switching over to it later today. You shouldn't see any changes, except:\n\n* All the comments on the blog will disappear. They're not lost, and I plan to get them back, but I need to find the best way to do that. For now, comment via Twitter or Micro.blog.\n* The Atom feed may be broken. I'll try to get that fixed. The RSS feed should still be fine, and at the same location as before. Anything that uses it should carry on working without any fuss. \n* If you follow me via WordPress.com (Hi Andrew), sorry. That's going away. Try my [RSS feed](https://devilgate.org/blog/feed) instead. Or Twitter; all posts automatically get Tweeted to [my timeline](https://github.com/devilgate).\n\n\n\n[^wp5]: Which may have in part caused the problem.\n[^rif]: Rapid Inquiry Facility.\n[^tesla]: Named after Nikola Tesla.\n\n",

This is contrary to what we were told initially, but it makes complete sense even without technical analysis. <em>Anything</em> coming between someone else‚Äôs droplets and your lungs, or your droplets and someone else‚Äôs lungs, is better than <em>nothing</em> coming between them.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs like wearing a cycling helmet: I‚Äôve always thought that something between my head and the ground, should I come off, is better than nothing.</p>\n<p>And there are <a href=\"https://ragmask.com\">designs online for making masks</a> out of any old cloth. I feel <em>#blessed</em> that my daughter has an A-level in textiles and a sewing machine.</p>\n<p>On the question of masks, though, something has been confusing me since this all started. And to an extent, before that, really, when I‚Äôd occasionally see people out and about wearing what appeared to be a hospital-style mask. Which is, where did people get such things? How did they come to have what looked like professional medical supplies in their private possession? Aren‚Äôt these things <em>controlled</em>?</p>\n<p>Clearly not, for the last one. And I wondered <em>why</em>? Why did people have them? Now, that seems like a foolish question. And it ignores the cultural differences, whereby in parts of Asia it‚Äôs considered rude not to wear a mask if you are sick. Makes sense, though I always wonder how horrible it is if you sneeze while wearing one.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-6473-Rorschach\">\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not trapped in here with the coronavirus.

The narrator is an interesting character, though her practice of astrology adds nothing to the story and gets in its way to an extent.</p>\n<p>Each chapter has a quote from Blake as an epigraph.

Milkmen ‚Äì there were still milkmen in those years, sometimes with horse-drawn wagons ‚Äì and bread men, ditto, and even icemen, and certainly postmen (and yes, they were all men), had to leave things on the front doorsteps. We kids would stand outside in the snow ‚Äì for me, it was always winter in cities, as the rest of the time my family was up in the woods ‚Äì gazing at the mysterious signs and wondering what gruesome things were going on inside the houses. Children were especially susceptible to these diseases, especially diptheria ‚Äì I had four little cousins who died of it ‚Äì so once in a while a classmate would disappear, sometimes to return, sometimes not.\n</p></blockquote>\n</body></html>\n",

I was picking up some jeans that had been in for repair. That‚Äôs a good note for when this is all over, incidentally. If your Levis wear into holes or get torn, most of their shops offer a repair service now. They may have done for years; I only learned about it a month or so back. But it means that for significantly less than a new pair of jeans, I have <em>two</em> good-as-new pairs, including the ones which were <em>already</em> my favourites. One antidote to fast fashion.</p>\n<p>There was almost no-one around, and no-one was getting very close to anyone. In Lakeland I was able to get a refill (really, replacement) for one of our SodaStream CO<sub>2</sub> cylinders. But they didn‚Äôt have any new ones. It seems unlikely that those have been panic-bought, but <em>I</em> was thinking of getting an extra one in case it becomes hard to get replacements, so others might have been ahead of me.</p>\n<p>In and out within half an hour, and the parking was the least I‚Äôve ever paid at Westfield: ¬£3. I wouldn‚Äôt normally drive if I wasn‚Äôt buying much, but getting on the Overground would have been the opposite of social distancing.</p>\n<p>Or maybe not, if it had been as empty as the mall.</p>\n<p>But just yesterday I gave my daughter a lift to a friend‚Äôs house ‚Äî same idea, avoid the bus ‚Äî and up in Stamford Hill at around 4:30pm it was really busy with pedestrians. A lot of cars on the road, too. Maybe that was normal or less than, for that time on a Tuesday, though.</p>\n<p>Dropped into the wee Sainsbury‚Äôs on the way back. No fresh fruit or veg at all. Most tinned goods and bread gone ‚Äî no toilet rolls, obviously ‚Äî plenty of snacks and crisps, surprisingly. Either panic-buyers prefer healthy options, or Sainsbury‚Äôs are quicker at getting unhealthy supplies back.</p>\n<p>I have to confess to feeling a small amount of smugness at having stocked up over the last year or so. Brexit was the initial trigger, but I soon realised that having a supply of non-perishable items is actually pretty useful. If you can afford to buy a bit extra from time to time, and you‚Äôve got the space to store it all, of course.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, meals are going to get dull really fast without a regular supply of fresh things.</p>\n<p>But if that‚Äôs the most we have to worry about, we‚Äôre doing better than many. I hope you are coping OK, dear reader.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I heard of this book ‚Äî <a href=\"http://www.hpmor.com\">HPMOR</a>, as it‚Äôs known ‚Äî from my son, a couple of years ago. Didn‚Äôt think about it for a while, and then recently I saw a tweet from a friend-of-friends, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ciphergoth\">@ciphergoth</a>:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The correct quote is \"There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/n3qAmdyhV2\">https://t.co/n3qAmdyhV2</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Agxq7FruRk\">pic.twitter.com/Agxq7FruRk</a></p>\n<p>‚Äî Paul Crowley (@ciphergoth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ciphergoth/status/1222276296492769280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The fact that it was a quote from Harry Potter, and that I didn‚Äôt recognise it ‚Äî indeed, it didn‚Äôt seem like something Harry would say  ‚Äî intrigued me, so I clicked through.</p>\n<p>And then I shortly found myself downloading the ebook and reading it for the next‚Ä¶ actually, month or so.</p>\n<p>Because this book is <em>looooooong</em>! It‚Äôs a retelling of just the <em>first</em> Harry Potter book, along with much more, and it‚Äôs about half as long as all seven of the JKR originals.</p>\n<p>In fact, it could have done with an editor. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it has some weaknesses.</p>\n<p>First, the strengths, though. Yudkowsky can write a page-turner almost as well as Rowling. What we have here is an alternative universe in which Petunia Evans marries someone else, not Vernon Dursley. They adopt Harry, and bring him up in a loving home. Harry‚Äôs adoptive father is a scientist, which is where he learns his rationality. So his first thought when he discovers that magic exists is to try experiments to understand its capabilities and limits. Experimentation soon gets overwhelmed by events, though, as the plot gets going.</p>\n<p>There are other differences from the original, of course, and the end result is very different.</p>\n<p>Part of what Yudkowsky does is takes the literal translation of Voldemort‚Äôs name ‚Äî ‚Äúflees from death,‚Äù essentially ‚Äî recognises the rationality of that feeling ‚Äî who wouldn‚Äôt prefer going on living, to dying? ‚Äî and builds from there.</p>\n<p>The major flaws are wordiness and couple of authorial tics that get repetitive and mildly annoying. He has a tendency to refer to people by their role, rather than their name: ‚ÄúThe Defence Professor,‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúQuirrell,‚Äù for example. Which is fine if used sparingly, for variety. But he has people referring to other people like that, when they just wouldn‚Äôt.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs also overuse of  scenes that start like, ‚ÄúThe boy stood in the forest‚Ä¶‚Äù and only slowly revealing <em>which</em> boy. Again, fine occasionally, but he overdoes it.</p>\n<p>And a few Americanisms creep in: like calling the staff of Hogwarts the ‚Äúfaculty.‚Äù And anachronisms: nobody apologised for their snarkiness in 1992, since the word hadn‚Äôt been coined yet. Well, I could be wrong there: <a href=\"https://www.wordnik.com/words/snarky\">this site says</a> it goes back to 1906 or earlier. No-one in Britain, then.</p>\n<p>But I shouldn‚Äôt complain. It‚Äôs an astonishingly well-constructed work, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

When I saw the trailer (I think back in December, when we saw Knives Out) I was a bit freaked out by it. What‚Äôs this, you‚Äôve got a film about a kid in the Hitler Youth, with Hitler as a character, and they seem to be playing it for comedy? This looks well dodgy.</p><p>My kids knew it was by Taika Waititi , though, and that seemed to make it likely to be OK? I dunno, but eventually I decided to give it a chance.</p><p>And it turns out to be really good. A sweet film in many ways, though with plenty of menace and darkness, as you'd expect from where and when it's set -- which is an unnamed German town or city in the dying days of the Second World War. Waititi himself plays Hitler, who is not in fact the real one, but an imaginary friend that lets Jojo, the ten-year-old title character, talk to someone about the things he can't talk to anyone else about.</p><p>So I enjoyed it, but I can't help asking: why did he choose to make this film? Why that story, why now? It's based on a novel, Caging Skies by Christine Leunens.

				"title": "The Memory Police by Y≈çko Ogawa (Books 2020, 2)",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Translated by Stephen Snyder. I asked for this for Christmas, because I saw it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/20/the-memory-police-yoko-ogawa-review\">reviewed</a> in <cite>The Guardian</cite> and it sounded interesting. And it is, but I had some problems with it.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs look at the blurb:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <strong>Hat ribbon, bird, rose.</strong><br>\n  <br>\n  To the people on the island, a disappeared thing no longer has any meaning. It can be burned in the garden, thrown in the river or handed over to the Memory Police. Soon enough, the island forgets it ever existed.<br>\n  <br>\n  When a young novelist discovers that her editor is in danger of being taken away by the Memory Police, she desperately wants to save him. For some reason, he doesn‚Äôt forget, and it‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult to hide his memories. Who knows what will vanish next?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That ‚Äú[f]or some reason‚Äù is where this book doesn‚Äôt quite work for me. The setup is fine: a type of item, and the memories, the very <em>idea</em> of that item, disappears. The titular police make sure that all instances of the item ‚Äî roses, hats, photographs‚Ä¶ ‚Äî are removed. But some people keep their memories and the ideas, and try to keep the things. The Memory Police find them and cart them off.</p>\n<p>The protagonist‚Äôs mother was taken in that way when the protagonist was small.<sup id=\"fnref-6249-names\"><a href=\"#fn-6249-names\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Why is it happening? <em>How</em> is it happening? Who are the Memory Police, and what happens to the people they take? Can they be resisted, and how can the islanders get their memories back? These are the sorts of questions you would expect to have answered, were this a science fiction novel. Are the islanders the victims of some sort of mind-control experiment? Are they in a simulation?</p>\n<p>This is not a science fiction novel.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúFor some reason‚Äù. Don‚Äôt read this expecting to find out what the reason is, or to get answers to any of the other questions.</p>\n<p>All that said, I enjoyed reading it. The sense of danger, of menace, is palpable, but subtle. It‚Äôs about people trying to live their lives under these bizarre conditions. It‚Äôs just frustrating thinking about it now, about the unanswered questions.</p>\n<p>But maybe I‚Äôm reading it wrong. In her essay ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2010/01/18/sf-reading-protocols/\">SF reading protocols</a>,‚Äù Jo Walton writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  A reviewer wanted to make the zombies in Kelly Link‚Äôs ‚ÄúZombie Contingency Plans‚Äù (in the collection <cite><a href=\"http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/titledetail.cfm?titleNumber=1185675\">Magic For Beginners</a>)</cite> into metaphors. They‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre actual zombies. They may also be metaphors, but their metaphorical function is secondary to the fact that they‚Äôre actual zombies that want to eat your brains. Science fiction may be literalization of metaphor, it may be open to metaphorical, symbolic and even allegorical readings, but what‚Äôs real within the story is real within the story, or there‚Äôs no there there. I had this problem with one of the translators of my novel <cite>Tooth and Claw</cite>‚Äîhe kept emailing me asking what things represented. I had to keep saying no, the characters really were dragons, and if they represented anything that was secondary to the reality of their dragon nature. He kept on and on, and I kept being polite but in the end I bit his head off‚Äîmetaphorically, of course.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The essay is largely about how there is a ‚Äútoolkit‚Äù for reading SF ‚Äî a set of understandings, of tropes ‚Äî without which some can find the genre  difficult to understand. We learn that toolkit, or build it, from early reading of the genre. But she follows the above quote with this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  When I read literary fiction, I take the story as real on the surface first, and worry about metaphors and representation later, if at all. It‚Äôs possible that I may not be getting as much as I can from literary fiction by this method, in the same way that the people who want the zombies and dragons to be metaphorical aren‚Äôt getting as much as they could.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe that‚Äôs what went wrong for me with <cite>The Memory Police</cite>: Ogawa wrote a metaphorical work ‚Äî about people trying to live their lives under bizarre conditions, as I wrote above. I read it with the expectation that the bizarre conditions would have an explanation, and they don‚Äôt, because they are ‚Äúonly‚Äù metaphors.</p>\n<p>For, I would have to suppose, a totalitarian state, where the slightest infraction of arcane and obscure laws leads to being carted away by the secret police.</p>\n<p>We also get sections of the novel the protagonist is writing. It is about a woman who loses her voice, and communicates using a typewriter. Then the typewriter is taken away from her. It works as a metaphor for the situation the protagonist lives in: a metaphor within a metaphor.</p>\n<p>And from the <cite>Guardian</cite> review that started this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  Why this is happening is unknown; the ideology of totalitarian control and cultural isolation is implied, rather than explicitly outlined, and its intersection with the supernatural strengthens the feeling of allegory.\n</blockquote>\n<p>So maybe I should have been warned. Calling it ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù suggests something more in the magic realism vein. That might be a better way to approach it. Magic needs ‚Äî or at least, generally gets ‚Äî less of an explanation.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-6249-names\">\nNote the lack of names, too: the editor is given an initial, <em>R</em>, but the only character given an actual name is a dog.¬†<a href=\"#fnref-6249-names\">‚Ü©</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

Until 2021 we‚Äôll still be able to travel freely; there will be no added tariffs on goods; food standards will still be the high ones we‚Äôre used to.</p>\n<p>Ah yes, food standards. Just the other day I had a realisation ‚Äî no, it was something that I already knew. More a dawning fear of how close a bad thing was.

The chlorine washing is to kill off bacteria and make the meat fit for human consumption.</p>\n<p>So what that headline means is that a US trade deal could depend on the UK lowering its food standards. That‚Äôs what Brexit means: our government could choose to lower the standards of hygiene required in food production. Sit with that thought for a while.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of good things to think about on this bleak day. Both of those are also from America, and neither has anything to do with Brexit.

I‚Äôm there.</p>\n<p>The <em>best</em> Christmas songs, though, <em>do</em> belong to the ‚Äî let‚Äôs say ‚Äî secular side of things. I have a hierarchy of my personal favourites.

It‚Äôs not, though. It‚Äôs much darker and more interesting than that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  They sold me a dream of Christmas<br>\n  They sold me a Silent Night<br>\n  They told me a fairy story<br>\n  Till I believed in the Israelite\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>And that closing couplet:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Hallelujah, Noel, be it Heaven or hell<br>\n  The Christmas we get we deserve\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lake and Sinfield have argued that it‚Äôs not anti-religious or atheistic. Well, you can have your interpretation, guys. I know what I think.</p>\n<p>I mainly wrote this because I‚Äôve wanted to use the line I‚Äôve stolen as a title for years.

I had probably heard the title track ‚Äî it was a single, after all ‚Äî and I went and bought the album, most likely at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Menzies\">John Menzies</a> in Dumbarton (though maybe at Hall Audio, the nearby hi-fi shop, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_Group\">Woolies</a>, or Boots, who used to sell records in those days). I do know it cost ¬£3.99, because the band took a reduction in their royalties so it ‚Äî a double album ‚Äî could be sold at the same price as a single album. Excellent value, for one of the greatest records ever made.</p>\n<p>Though I paid for it a couple more times over the years.

I replaced it with a second-hand copy, probably from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Record-Shak/131108243603860\">Record Shak</a> (<em>sic</em>) on Clerk Street.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>One interesting thing about this book that I don‚Äôt recall noticing when I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/2007/09/20/the-steep-approach.html\">read it twelve years ago</a> is that the story itself <em>is</em> the titular approach. We don‚Äôt get to Garbadale House until about two-thirds of the way through, and then the rest of it is set there. With a few flashbacks and <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">-forwards</span> thrown in to both sections.</p>\n<p>Banksie always plays with form and structure, and this is no exception. Not just the aforementioned directional flashes, but use of different viewpoint characters and tenses. Mostly it‚Äôs from the viewpoint of Alban McGill, one of the many members of the Wopuld family. Some scenes are from that of a cousin of his. There are even a couple of instances of promiscuous PoV, or ‚Äúhead-hopping,‚Äù where we get the thoughts of another character within the same scene.</p>\n<p>Also some parts switch to present-tense, while most if it is past. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any obvious function to those switches: it‚Äôs not like the tense reflects the timeline within the story. It seems arbitrary, almost random ‚Äî though maybe I‚Äôm missing something there.</p>\n<p>None of this harms the story, it‚Äôs just worth noting. The strangest of these devices is that there are three or four sections in first-person, from the PoV of a minor character. All the rest is third-person. That gives the impression that this character is more significant than he is. The text in those sections is also rendered with spelling mistakes and grocer‚Äôs apostrophes, as if it was the direct transcript of what this relatively poorly-educated character has scribbled down.</p>\n<p>What‚Äôs the point of all that? I‚Äôm not sure. Just writerly games, maybe. I wonder if it suggests that Banks didn‚Äôt think the story itself was interesting enough to sustain the narrative, which might be a valid criticism. A well-off family with a secret at its heart has to decide whether to sell its business. The secret comes out, but it doesn‚Äôt make much difference. It would be significant to the characters affected, but we hardly see them after the reveal.</p>\n<p>Endearing characters, though, and even on a second read (I didn‚Äôt recall the secret), it keeps the pages turning.</p>\n<p>As I said twelve years ago, ‚ÄúIn a book like this, the pleasure is in the journey more than the destination.‚Äù</p>\n</body></html>\n",

They would say: <strong>‚ÄòBut it‚Äôs on Facebook ‚Äì how can there be something that isn‚Äôt true?‚Äô</strong> They think there are gatekeepers but there aren‚Äôt.‚Äù\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Emphases mine.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Well tonight is a fucking disaster. Even if the reality is lower than the exit poll, it looks like it‚Äôs going to be a landslide for the Tories. We‚Äôll get a hard Brexit starting in a month and a half (and taking years and years before it ‚Äúgets done,‚Äù of course). We‚Äôll see more privatisation in the NHS. We‚Äôll see more austerity, I don‚Äôt doubt, despite the spending pledges that might have been in the Tory manifesto. And we‚Äôll see moves to restrict what parliament and the courts can do to protect ordinary people.</p>\n<p>Our best hope is that Johnson is incompetent, and that‚Äôs not something we should have to rely on.</p>\n<p>What is wrong with this country? Why do people continue to vote against not just the interests of the most vulnerable in society, but against their <em>own</em> self interest?</p>\n<p>On Twitter a lot of people are blaming Corbyn, and I think they‚Äôre right. I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/12/10/fear-and-loathing-all-over-the-land/\">said just the other day</a> that I didn‚Äôt understand the dislike; but a thread by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/RussInCheshire\">@RussInCheshire</a> has helped to clarify my thinking. This regards not so much why people generally dislike him, but why he was ineffectual or worse as a leader. The key points:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  People will say ‚Äúthe media is biased‚Äù. Yes. But that‚Äôs the environment Labour leaders always operate in. Complaining about it is like trawler captains complaining the sea is wet. Yep. Learn to thrive in those conditions, or get off the boat.</p>\n<p>  People will say ‚Äúthey treated him worse than any previous leader‚Äù. They did. Cos he was shit at working the press, had a history of opinions that could be easily made to look awful, was inept on antisemitism, shifty on Brexit and cantankerous on TV.</p>\n<p>  People will say ‚Äúno way is he racist‚Äù. Perhaps. But if people accused me of antisemitism, I‚Äôd be able to clearly defend myself, demonstrate my credentials, and put in place a strategy to stop accusations. He couldn‚Äôt. If he‚Äôs not antisemitic, he‚Äôs inept.</p>\n<p>  People will say ‚Äúvoters love him in person‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure. But we‚Äôve been in the age of broadcasting for 80 years. What the hell use is being warm and cuddly to 600 people in a field, when you come over badly to 60 million people on TV?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The thread <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RussInCheshire/status/1205249028637806592\">starts here</a>, but it might be easier to read <a href=\"https://threader.app/thread/1205249028637806592\">here, as expanded</a> by the <a href=\"https://threader.app\">Threader App</a>.</p>\n<p>I still don‚Äôt understand ‚Äî I never will ‚Äî people who switch from Labour all the way to Conservative. They just vox-popped someone on the telly who used to vote Labour, but ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt, in conscience,‚Äù vote for them with Corbyn as leader. Fair enough. But she voted Tory. Why go all the way over to the party that diametrically opposes the values she claims to support, when there are other progressive parties, that support some of those values. The party she voted for opposes those values.</p>\n<p>Baffling. Utterly baffling.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It doesn‚Äôt seem to come from dislike of his policies. Some of the people who say they don‚Äôt like or don‚Äôt trust him seem to be Labour voters, who you‚Äôd expect to have similar beliefs. Even if those people have more centrist beliefs, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be close enough to the party‚Äôs current policies  not to be put off totally.</p>\n<p>It seems almost to be <em>personal</em>. Do some people dislike him as a person? Strikes me as odd, as he comes across as quite moderate and reasonable to me. To be sure, he can get snappy with interviewers at times, but it‚Äôs nothing compared to some people. And at least he doesn‚Äôt bluster; doesn‚Äôt lie; and always gives the impression that he knows what he‚Äôs talking about.</p>\n<p>Yet some people say they don‚Äôt trust him. Sometimes those same people say they <em>do</em> trust Johnson, even as they acknowledge he lies. It‚Äôs unfathomable.</p>\n<p>On tonight‚Äôs <cite>Channel 4 News</cite> they interviewed a guy in Johnson‚Äôs constituency who claimed to be a socialist, but who is going to vote for Johnson this time. They didn‚Äôt push him for an explanation.</p>\n<p>In the same constituency there was a business owner who had always voted Tory but is <em>not</em> going to this time, because of the way the party has been taken over by the far right. It takes a Tory businessman to recognise what a ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù can‚Äôt. We are through the looking glass and no mistake.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I‚Äôll be voting Green. I hope everyone reading this will get out and vote on Thursday, for anyone who isn‚Äôt the Tories, and to stop Brexit.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

As I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/11/14/watchmen-by-alan-moore-dave-gibbons-books-2019-21/\">suggested I might</a>.</p>\n<p>It felt a little grubby, going to the NowTV site and setting up an account. As you know, Sky TV and I have a history. Or maybe an anti-history, insofar as I am anti everything that their former owner stands for. But the key word is ‚Äúformer.‚Äù With Comcast now owning it, I can feel a little better about giving them my time and possibly some money.</p>\n<p>Still, though: grubby.</p>\n<p>But what‚Äôs worse, as a viewing experience, is that their app is the worst video-playback app I‚Äôve ever used. It‚Äôs fine at all the basics; it even has a ten-second jump back and forward feature, which is good. But! It completely fails at subtitles.</p>\n<p>Now,  in this era ‚Äî this platinum age of television ‚Äî subtitles are often an essential part of viewing. And that isn‚Äôt true just due to my age, because my kids, who are young adults, are at least as likely as us olds to want them on. Mumblecore actors are to blame. Or maybe bad sound on our TV. Or a combination. Doesn‚Äôt matter. We watch with subtitles on <em>a lot</em> of the time, and I wanted them on for <cite>Watchmen</cite>.</p>\n<p>But NowTV ‚Äî in its Mac app, at least ‚Äî just can‚Äôt handle them properly. They either freeze, so you get the same sentence stuck on the screen for five minutes; or they just get out of sync. Sometimes they rush through minutes of text at a time, as if trying to catch up. In the end I turned them off.</p>\n<p>But I watched one episode on my iPad, and the subtitles were fine there. So I guess it is the actual Mac app. The Mac plugged into the telly is an old one. A <em>nine-year-old</em> MacBook Pro, in fact. I‚Äôm impressed that it‚Äôs still working, though I did <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2016/04/27/i-upgraded-my-macbook/\">upgrade it at one point</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that can‚Äôt be the reason it‚Äôs bad, because I‚Äôve also tried it on my 2017 MBP, with exactly the same results.</p>\n<p>But what about the programme?</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a sequel to the comic, set around thirty years later. I found the first episode kind of annoying, though I‚Äôm not quite sure why. Too much of it set in the past, maybe? But as we‚Äôve got to know the characters and things have moved along, it‚Äôs definitely interesting. I‚Äôve watched the first five episodes so far. Up to which point it‚Äôs kind of a cop show with an unusual background. Cops go masked so that criminals can‚Äôt identify them. Criminals go masked too, of course, specifically in Rorscach-style black and white masks.</p>\n<p>And there‚Äôs a mysterious old guy who puts on plays reenacting the origin of <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Osterman\">Doctor Manhattan</a>. You‚Äôll have guesses about who he is, if you know the source material. Well, one guess.</p>\n<p>I like the way they‚Äôve built on the comic, and are weaving the backstory in. Though I think it must be extremely confusing for anyone who hasn‚Äôt read the novel, or at least seen the movie.</p>\n<p>My main question (apart from the obvious ones, like what‚Äôs going on with Veidt?) is: why is <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Laurie_Juspeczyk\">Laurie</a> using her father‚Äôs surname? It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me that she‚Äôd call herself Blake, instead of Juspeczyck.</p>\n<p>Oh, and whatever happened to <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Dan_Dreiberg\">Dan Dreiberg</a>? I want to see some Nite owl action. Something that looked a lot like the <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Owlship\">Owlship</a> appeared in the first episode, so maybe he‚Äôll turn up. As, I imagine, will Doctor Manhattan.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Plenty of non-Jewish people are put off by it too.</p>\n<p>There are two things I don‚Äôt understand.</p>\n<p>If there are antisemites in Labour (which, again, does seem to be the case): why and how? Who are these people that have joined a party of the left, a party that has always been anti-nazi, anti-racist, pro equality and human rights ‚Äî who join it, and yet stand in direct opposition to its core values? It‚Äôs like a climate-change denier joining the Green Party.</p>\n<p>Further, why now? Why has this blown up in the last couple of years? These invasive members presumably haven‚Äôt <em>just</em> joined the party. It‚Äôs hard to imagine that they joined because of Corbyn being the leader.</p>\n<p>Unless that‚Äôs exactly what it is. Maybe Corbyn‚Äôs seeming weakness on responding to the problem. and/or a willful misunderstanding of his stance on Palestine and the government of Israel, has attracted such people to the party.

Corbyn was, predictably, calmer, more sensible, and less blustering. He needed to answer the ‚ÄúWhat way would you campaign in a second referendum‚Äù question that Johnson kept going back to, but otherwise he handled it pretty well.</p>\n<p>Johnson, of course, is the epitome of bluster, barely gave a straight answer to anything, and went over his allotted time on every question, as well as his opening and closing statements.</p>\n<p>I criticise him for that since he was violating the agreed-upon format. But the time-limited questions may have been the worst part of the event. The purpose is to limit bloviation, I suppose, but it seemed like often the chair was cutting the speaker off while they were still trying to make a point. I saw a tweet while it was going on, to the effect that part of the problem in politics is that everything is reduced to soundbites, with no opportunity to go into details. I‚Äôm inclined to agree.</p>\n<p>However, much more interesting, and a bettter format, was the interviews, an hour later, with the leaders of the some of the other parties: Jo Swinson, Nicola Sturgeon, Si√¢n Berry of the Greens, and, unfortunately, Nigel Farage.</p>\n<p>One interviewer, one interviewee at a time, and it was all much more sensible. That is, in part, because of the people involved, of course. The three women were all good, especially Wee Nicola, as we like to call her. But perhaps it wouldn‚Äôt have worked so well if Johnson had been in the interviewee‚Äôs chair. He‚Äôd have been havering and talking over the interviewer, no doubt. Though to be fair, Farage managed not to do that, so who knows.</p>\n<p>But overall, I think that the debate format is not the best way to present your ideas.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

The Murdochs no longer own Sky TV, so I can let myself watch it.</p>\n<p>But then we have the other ethical question, about <cite>Watchmen</cite> in particular.

I saw the movie version, but I didn‚Äôt get the <cite>Before Watchmen</cite> spin-offs.</p>\n<p>Well, it‚Äôs been a long time; Moore and Gibbons must have known what they were signing up for, even if things didn‚Äôt go quite as they expected.

The trailers look great, anyway.</p>\n<p>The difference with this year‚Äôs pause will be that, while I will get back to the Chambers eventually, I‚Äôm obviously not in any hurry to do so.

Surprise, surprise. I don‚Äôt really care for dystopias, <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2015/09/08/station-eleven-by-emily-st-john-mandel-books-2015-8/\">as I‚Äôve said before</a>. Interesting that the book I linked to there had just won the Clarke, and the one we‚Äôre discussing was the inaugural winner of that award.</p>\n<p>For the first few chapters I was distracted by wondering how this situation, this state, could have come to be. Strangely what I found difficult to cope with was not the restrictions, the rolling back of rights ‚Äî they are horrific, but I could and can easily imagine an America (or, hell, maybe even a Britain) that could enact those laws.</p>\n<p>No, what I found hardest to believe in was the dress codes. The way not just the Handmaids, but the marthas (domestic servants), econowives (lower-class, probably infertile women, assigned to lower-class men) and even Wives (the wives of the ruling-class men) all dress in the standard costume of their class.</p>\n<p>Somehow I feel ‚Äî or at least felt ‚Äî that it would be harder to get everyone to dress the same way than to obey laws that restrict more important freedoms.</p>\n<p>As the chapters went on, those concerns evaporated. The telling of the backstory through Offred‚Äôs reminiscences outlines a convincing route from 80s America to Gilead. Though a lot more could be told: it is only an outline. Still, it‚Äôs enough.</p>\n<p>These days, with actual nazis poisoning our political discourse, and attempts to roll back reproductive rights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/06/french-protests-against-ivf-treatment-for-gay-and-single-women\">even in France</a>, it sometimes feels ‚Äî as Atwood no doubt intended ‚Äî that Gilead is not so much a fable as a warning.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Don‚Äôt read on if you haven‚Äôt seen it and care about being spoiled.</p>\n<p>Or maybe ‚Äúbuddy pic,‚Äù rather than ‚Äúlove story;‚Äù but the relationship between the two leads will be analysed for its homoerotic content, no doubt.</p>\n<p>How it certainly <em>has</em> been described is ‚Äúa love letter to Hollywood,‚Äù and that‚Äôs fair enough. What it also is, is a counter-factual, or alternative history. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not going to claim this one for SF.<sup id=\"fnref-5837-sf\"><a href=\"#fn-5837-sf\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The main characters ‚Äì fading cowboy actor Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his regular stunt double Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt ‚Äì are invented. But most of the other named characters, and many who are mentioned or appear as extras, are real people. The most significant of these is Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie. And it‚Äôs her story that makes this film most interesting, and maybe problematic.</p>\n<p>Because of course she died tragically, murdered by members of Charles Manson‚Äôs ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù cult. And in this version ‚Äî she doesn‚Äôt.</p>\n<p>If you know the history ‚Äî which of course, many younger people won‚Äôt, which makes for different ways of experiencing the film ‚Äî then you spend half the time expecting the massacre. There are captioned dates, and even though most of us wouldn‚Äôt know the date of the murders, there can‚Äôt really be any other reason for showing them. And then when it comes, something else happens.</p>\n<p>The violence in that scene is gruesome, over the top, ludicrous ‚Äî almost hallucinogenic, making me wonder if the tripping Booth<sup id=\"fnref-5837-transgressor\"><a href=\"#fn-5837-transgressor\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> is meant to have hallucinated some or all of it. But there‚Äôs no need for there to be so much of it, or for the majority of it to be directed at women. The ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù did consist largely of women, I guess, but I can‚Äôt help but feeling that Tarantino is revelling in it a little too much.</p>\n<p>And on top of all that, as my family agreed after seeing it: there‚Äôs no real <em>need</em> for the whole Sharon Tate thread of the story. It would have made a fine tale if were just about the two actors against the backdrop of late-60s Hollywood. I wonder what the point of it was. Did Tarantino feel he could in some way ‚Äúsave‚Äù Sharon Tate?</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5837-sf\">\nAlthough that might be an interesting exercise.

I think I saw a tweet, or something, thought it looked interesting, and instantly bought it because it was only a few quid on Kindle. It‚Äôs a huge book which tries ‚Äî successfully, in my mind ‚Äî to explain how the bulk of David Lynch‚Äôs creative works can be considered part of a single story, which Horton refers to as <cite>The Dream</cite>.</p>\n<p>Now obviously <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, <cite>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</cite>, and <cite>Twin Peaks: The Return</cite> are all part of the same story. As are the various spinoff books: Jennifer Lynch‚Äôs <cite>The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer</cite>, and Scott Frost‚Äôs <cite>The Autobiography of FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes</cite>, from back around the time of the original broadcast; and Mark Frost‚Äôs more recent <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/03/the-secret-of-twin-peaks-by-mark-frost-books-2017-1/\">The Secret History of Twin Peaks</a></cite> and <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/02/27/twin-peaks-the-final-dossier-by-mark-frost-books-2018-4/\">Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier</a></cite>, which I‚Äôve written about here.</p>\n<p>But Horton argues that the whole story gets kicked off in <cite>Eraserhead</cite>, and that <cite>Blue Velvet</cite>, <cite>Lost Highway</cite>, <cite>Mulholland Dr</cite> and <cite>Inland Empire</cite> are side stories related to the main branch. The overall story being about an eternal being, The Dreamer, who dreams reality into existence, and also creates another being, known as Jowday, or Judy, who becomes his adversary. BOB, the possessing spirit of the original <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, is a creation of this entity, and the Black and White Lodges are the vanguards in the battle between the two beings.</p>\n<p>Sure, on one level it‚Äôs just good vs evil, heaven &amp; hell ‚Äî ‚Äújust,‚Äù I say, as if that wasn‚Äôt enough. But the sheer scope of it is astonishing. The eighteen hours of <cite>The Return</cite> has been hailed as an incredible masterpiece of visual storytelling. But when you include all that I‚Äôve listed above, and three of Lynch‚Äôs paintings to boot ‚Äî it must be one of the greatest ‚Äî in terms of size, at least ‚Äî creative works by a single visionary. True, it‚Äôs far from being by a single <em>creator</em>, but the vision behind it is solely or primarily Lynch‚Äôs, or that of Lynch and Mark Frost.</p>\n<p>And even if the connections to the other films are just in Horton‚Äôs head (and, to be fair, those of others whose work he acknowledges): the obviously-connected stuff is still amazing, and the current work, Horton‚Äôs book that I‚Äôm writing about, is something a of a creative triumph itself.</p>\n<p>One that is slightly marred by its self-published nature and obvious lack of an editor ‚Äî there are a <em>lot</em> of typos ‚Äî but a hugely impressive one nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Though obviously it‚Äôs only for the very serious <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> fan.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I had vaguely seen references to ‚Äúratios,‚Äù and was aware it was something to do with engagement on Twitter and elsewhere. But I hadn‚Äôt understood what exactly people meant by it. Then last night I saw a tweet in which someone said, ‚ÄúI accept I‚Äôve been ratiod.‚Äù (Should the verb form rather be ‚Äúratioed‚Äù? Hard to say. Neither looks quite right.)</p>\n<p>A search for understanding led me to <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-ratio\">this article on  Know Your Meme</a>.  It tells us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The Ratio refers to an unofficial Twitter law which states that if the amount of replies to a tweet greatly outnumbers the amount of retweets and likes, then the tweet is bad\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>and goes into some detail about the origin of the term.</p>\n<p>It makes me sad to read that. Imagine an interaction system where, if people reply to something you say, that‚Äôs bad. Well, it seems we don‚Äôt have to imagine it: we can see it right here on the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù web.</p>\n<p>I like to get replies on Twitter or elsewhere. A reply means, to me, that someone has read what I‚Äôve written, thought about it, and found it worth responding to. I‚Äôm aware that I speak from a position of some privilege, in that I‚Äôm not in a group that is likely to experience the mass abuse that many do. But something has broken down in our systems of interaction if getting replies mean what you said ‚Äúis bad.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm far from the first to have made that observation, of course.</p>\n<p>But consider <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a>, the still-young social network based on blogs that I‚Äôve <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/02/02/success-for-micro-blog/\">written abut before</a>. Micro.blog has replies, but it doesn‚Äôt even have the concept of likes or retweets/reblogs. If you read a post and want to say something about it ‚Äî even just that you like it ‚Äî you have to reply. With words, in human language.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a much friendlier place than Twitter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eli.li/2019/06/18/i-know-there-are-some-ham-radio-folks-on-the-indieweb-and-adjacent-so-im-passing-along-this-question\">This conversation</a> from the last day or two gives a good flavour of the kind of thing you can expect.</p>\n<p>If you clicked through that link you‚Äôll have seen that it appears to be ‚Äî and is ‚Äî on the blog of the user who made the original post. The responses appear as blog comments. But while every Micro.blog user has a blog, you don‚Äôt have to interact with it <em>as</em> a blog if you don‚Äôt want to. You can do it all through the Micro.blog app or one of the third-party clients, or just the Micro.blog website, where <a href=\"https://micro.blog/eli/4107886\">you can see the same conversation</a>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you can <a href=\"https://micro.blog/devilgate\">see all my posts here</a>, as well as at their <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/\">natural home</a>.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs well worth a try if you‚Äôre looking for a less toxic social-media environment.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Back when the internet was young ‚Äî or at least the commercial, available-at-home internet ‚Äî I sent an email with the  subject line, ‚ÄúBicycle on the Superhighway‚Äù. It was about me having a publicly-accessible email address for the first time since uni (as opposed to one that was only usable within the company where I worked at the time).</p>\n<p>This was back when people ‚Äî inspired, if I recall correctly, by Al Gore ‚Äî were calling the net the ‚Äú<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_superhighway\">Information Superhighway</a>.‚Äù</p>\n<p>This post is not about all that, though; this is about literal cycling on a literal superhighway: specifically London‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/routes-and-maps/cycle-superhighways\">Cycle Superhighways</a>.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Since the building where I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/05/08/new-job-obtained/\">now work</a> has showers, I decided it was time to get back on the bike. And since it‚Äôs in Westminster, it turns out there‚Äôs a really easy route, that uses CS6 and CS3: down Farringdon Road and west along Embankment, by the river.</p>\n<p>These are fantastic cycling facilities, especially the Embankment one. Properly separated from the motor traffic, plenty of room to move and overtake, great sequencing of traffic lights so you hardly have to stop. It‚Äôs hard to fault it. Especially compared to nearly every other pathetic painted cycle lane in the city.</p>\n<p>It gets a bit hairy where it all ends, in Parliament Square: the traffic there is unfeasibly heavy. Who drives near parliament?</p>\n<p>If there‚Äôs a downside to it all, it‚Äôs this: I suspect that the motorised traffic is busier and faster, exactly because it‚Äôs not tempered by having bikes in the mix. I can‚Äôt be sure ‚Äî I‚Äôve never used Embankment before, and it‚Äôs years since I used to cycle regularly on Farringdon Road ‚Äî but it feels to me that there‚Äôs a crazy amount of traffic and that it‚Äôs going faster than ever.</p>\n<p>The latter can‚Äôt really be true ‚Äî there are still speed limits, and they either won‚Äôt have changed or might have dropped to 20 mph in sections. But I still get this sense that, freed from interacting with the fragile two-wheeled minority, the armoured legions behave more like they‚Äôre on a motorway.</p>\n<p>Whether that‚Äôs the case or not, the number of people cycling ‚Äî especially in the recent bright spring weather ‚Äî is huge. The only time I‚Äôve seen more cyclists together was when I did the London to Brighton ride many years ago.</p>\n<p>And also in the mix now are electric scooters and electric skateboards, which makes it all the more interesting. There‚Äôs even the odd cycle rickshaw.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôll be interesting to see how the volume changes with the seasons, but you can‚Äôt beat it for a way to commute: it‚Äôs faster than the tube, it saves you money, and you get some exercise. I recommend it for anyone who‚Äôs able.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

In fact I started it sometime last year. But reading the Clash book did make me want to get back to this, and refresh my memories of the early days of punk.</p>\n<p>Reading a history of a time you lived through is interesting. Not that I was involved in the events, but I was distantly aware of at least some of them. In the years the book covers I was between 12 and 15. Or maybe just 14, as it only gets as far as early 79. It‚Äôs a short period of time, looking back, and they ‚Äî the Pistols, and most of the other bands too ‚Äî were incredibly young. They were just 20 and 21 when they signed their first deal. And their second. And their third.</p>\n<p>At times Savage appears to think that punk was over when the pistols split, if not before. And generally to have quite negative thoughts about it as it developed Though he undercuts that contempt later, in the appendices and in the notes scattered through the huge discography at the end. He acknowledges the influence of punk, though considers it just to be one of a range of genres or forms that influences popular music. Which is fair enough, though there are still, even today, bands that consider themselves to be punk. Whether that‚Äôs a good thing or not, I don‚Äôt know.</p>\n<p>Something that came out of it that surprised me ‚Äî though doesn‚Äôt, now that I know the facts ‚Äî is that you can no longer get the film of <cite>The Great Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Swindle</cite> in any form (though you can still get the soundtrack album). That‚Äôs because it was McLaren‚Äôs project, it sets him up as hero, and makes Lydon the almost-unseen villain. Lydon hated McLaren by the end, and eventually won control of the Sex Pistols name and assets in a series of court cases. Presumably he controls whether it will ever be released.</p>\n<p>I find this mildly annoying, because I saw it couple of times when I was a student, and enjoyed it, and wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing it again. Second-hand DVD copies are available, but they‚Äôre mostly pricey and/or being shipped from the States.</p>\n<p>I suppose the more recent, documentary film, <cite>The Filth and the Fury</cite>, might be worth seeing. I see that, like <cite>The Swindle</cite>, it is directed by Julien Temple. Clearly Lydon didn‚Äôt mind <em>his</em> work on McLaren‚Äôs film.</p>\n<p>What doesn‚Äôt come through very much is any sense of Jon Savage himself. What was he doing, and how did he get involved in all this? I gather he wrote a fanzine, <cite>London‚Äôs Outrage</cite>, and he became a journalist writing for <cite>Sounds</cite>, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Savage\">his Wikipedia entry</a>. While he has done extensive research, and interviewed many of the participants, some of the story clearly comes from his being there at the time.</p>\n<p>But the only real sense of that we get is that, towards the last third or so of the book, a series of dated, italicised entries appear. They clearly are ‚Äî or are meant to be ‚Äî diary entries from the time. Or notes for articles he wrote at the time, perhaps, giving us something of a first-person view of some to the gigs and so on. I would have liked to see more made of these, or more generally about his experience and from his point of view. A book about punk ought to be a bit more gonzo, I think.</p>\n<p>But on the whole it‚Äôs a great read.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>You could spend a lot of time wondering what makes Theresa May tick.</p>\n<p>She says she supported remain and voted to stay in the European Union. So her increasing fervour for Brexit has been one of the most confusing factors in British politics over the last two and a half years.</p>\n<p>Taking over the Tory leadership after David Cameron resigned was always going to be a poisoned chalice. No-one would have had a good time in that position, except maybe a genuine hard quitter like Jacob Rees-Mogg. That‚Äôs probably why Gove and Johnson pulled out.</p>\n<p>If she truly believed that staying in was best, though, she would not have rushed into triggering Article 50 (nor would she have gone to court to fight for her wish to do so by diktat; luckily National Hero Gina Miller had the nation‚Äôs back on that one).</p>\n<p>If she had used more care, collaboration, and consideration, she might have had an easier time when Article 50 finally was triggered and the negotiations started. In fact if she had been more thoughtful in the first place she might even have said something like, ‚ÄúThe vote was close; the country is clearly divided. We will discuss the possible ways forward in parliament and with the rest of the EU, and come back to you, the people, for confirmation when we better understand what Brexit means.‚Äù <sup id=\"fnref-5415-brexitmeans\"><a href=\"#fn-5415-brexitmeans\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>But no: ‚ÄúBrexit means Brexit‚Äù: she knew up front what it meant, and never deviated. Even if the majority of the country had no idea what it would mean.</p>\n<p>She then proceeded as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ignore any idea of cross-party talks and so involving parliament (the UK‚Äôs sovereign body) in the negotiations;</li>\n<li>trigger Article 50 as soon as she could;</li>\n<li>negotiate with the EU27 almost in secret;</li>\n<li>have inflexible ‚Äúred lines‚Äù to appease the hard quitters, leaving herself no room for compromise in the negotiations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It‚Äôs a truism, even a cliche, to say that she puts the Tory party before the country. But the only way I can explain such a dramatic change of heart is that her love for the Tory party overruled her knowledge that being in the EU was, is, and will be the best situation for the UK. And that she somehow convinced herself that she could heal her fatally-divided party.</p>\n<p>In fact, the very thing that Cameron was trying to do by calling he referendum in the first place.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúTory eurosceptics‚Äù used to be a common enough phrase, but it denoted a tiny fringe of the party: a few loons like John Redwood. But in trying to appease them, two Tory leaders and prime ministers have turned them mainstream and brought us to where we are today, on the brink of leaving the EU without any kind of agreement for our future relationship.</p>\n<p>And their party is as divided as ever.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5415-brexitmeans\">\nThat‚Äôs fanciful, of course.

The subtitle is ‚ÄúReagan, Thatcher, and the Last Stand of A Band That Mattered,‚Äù<sup id=\"fnref-5409-oxford\"><a href=\"#fn-5409-oxford\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> which captures well its structure. It interleaves the politics of what was happening on both sides of the Atlantic ‚Äî the miners‚Äô strike, Reagan‚Äôs nuclear brinksmanship, the Iran/Contra scandal ‚Äî with what was happening with the most political of the original punk bands.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs interesting to read a history of a time you lived through and were, however tangentially, involved in. Andersen and Heibutzki more than do justice to their material. The research they must have done is impressive. I know personally that Andersen came to the UK on a research trip, but aside from that they have interviewed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Howard\">three</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Sheppard\">non-original</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_White\">members</a> of The Clash, <a href=\"https://kosmovinyl.com/\">Kosmo Vinyl</a>, and various other people who were involved or just had something useful to say.</p>\n<p>And they must have spent a lot of time listening to concert tapes and studying set lists ‚Äî which doesn‚Äôt sound like a chore to me, it‚Äôs fair to say.</p>\n<p>I learned two major things: first, I‚Äôd forgotten how good <cite>Cut the Crap</cite> is. I haven‚Äôt listened to it in ages, and when I went to do so on Apple Music, I found it isn‚Äôt there. Nor is it on Spotify. I have it on vinyl, but I don‚Äôt currently have access to a record player.</p>\n<p>Luckily Amazon and CDs both still exist, so I put some more money the way of‚Ä¶ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Rhodes\">Bernie Rhodes</a>, as it turns out.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs the other big thing I found out: how ‚Äî <em>difficult</em>, let‚Äôs say ‚Äî Rhodes was. Not least since he signed the band ‚Äî well, Joe and Paul: the others were effectively employees ‚Äî into a contract that gave him, Rhodes, control over the album, as well as the name ‚ÄúThe Clash.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But worse was the way he treated the new members while they were with the band. Constantly haranguing them, telling them they weren‚Äôt up to scratch, shouting at them‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a wonder they stayed. It sounds like an abusive environment.</p>\n<p>Joe could and should have stopped it, but it seems like he was still to some extent in Rhodes‚Äôs thrall ‚Äî Bernie did bring the band together, after all ‚Äî and possible suffering from depression. Certainly he was drinking heavily, and during that time his dad died and his mum got ill, and he became a father himself. It was a difficult time for him.</p>\n<p>I have more to say about the album, but I think that‚Äôs for a separate post. For now, this is a great rock book about a little-discussed time in the history of my favourite band.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5409-oxford\">\nGood to see the proper use of the Oxford comma there.¬†<a href=\"#fnref-5409-oxford\">‚Ü©</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

Not least for the closing quote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that Italian coffee has always been bad,‚Äù Campeotto said. ‚ÄúThey have been geniuses. The god of coffee is the Italian espresso. The problem is, they have been stuck there. They stopped.‚Äù\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If they had already achieved the ‚Äúgod of coffee‚Äù (which I happen to agree with), then why would they do anything <em>other</em> than stop? If you‚Äôve already achieved perfection you have no need to improve. Just make sure you maintain that level.</p>\n<p>I spent twelve months of 1989-90 in Turin. A cappuccino was 1200 lire, or about 60p (around 45-50 US cents, probably). And it was <em>delicious</em>. The best coffee I had, or have, ever tasted.</p>\n<p>The growth of Starbucks and the other chains came after that, and I‚Äôve been looking for coffee as good ever since. I‚Äôve never found it. The closest I ever found in London was Costa in its early days. It has slipped down to the level of Starbucks and Caff√® Nero, though.</p>\n<p>Which is not to say that any of those are truly <em>bad</em>: not, at least, compared to what was available before they came on the scene.</p>\n<p>But nothing matches my memory of Torinese cappuccino.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Right, let‚Äôs get 2019 off to a start by talking about my favourite TV programme. I haven‚Äôt said anything about the recent season of <cite>Doctor Who</cite> here since my <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/07/5050/\">appreciative post</a> at the end of the first episode. Not for any reason other than not getting round to it.</p>\n<p>I absolutely love this iteration of the series. Jodie Whittaker is fantastic as The Doctor, and the supporting cast is brilliant as well. I like the crowded Tardis feel. It does have the limitation that some of the characters don‚Äôt get as much time or as many lines as others. That‚Äôs been notably true of Yaz ‚Äî except in the ‚ÄúDemons of the Punjab‚Äù episode, of course.</p>\n<p>But there‚Äôs plenty of time for her to be developed further, assuming they‚Äôre all sticking around. And the focus being more on Ryan and Graham was entirely correct, since if there was an overarching theme to the season, it was grief.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not perfect. There have been several occasions when I‚Äôve thought that the writing team don‚Äôt really understand what a galaxy is, or the scale of it. Lines like ‚Äúhalf the people in the galaxy are unemployed,‚Äù or ‚Äúthey‚Äôve crossed four galaxies to get here,‚Äù just don‚Äôt really make a lot of sense. And there have been several episodes where things maybe weren‚Äôt as tidily resolved as we‚Äôre used to.</p>\n<p>Tonight‚Äôs New Year special episode, ‚ÄúResolution,‚Äù was a classic example of the kind of story where the ideas are good, but the whole thing could have been improved if they‚Äôd taken the time to come up with slightly better ways to make things happen. Some way of defeating the enemy that didn‚Äôt involve the microwave oven, for example. And the whole vacuum/supernova bit at the end was kind of farcical.</p>\n<p>But no matter. This season was all about the character dynamics, and those were great. It‚Äôs a strong start for Chris Chibnall as showrunner, and an incredibly strong start for Jodie Whittaker.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Which may be only three or four times. A friend got into Michener when we were teenagers. None of his books much interested me, until I looked at this.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a tale of hippies and others in 1969. Six young people from various countries meet each other in Torremolinos, and drift around the Iberian Peninsula and parts of Africa. The narrator, seemingly detached third-person at first, turns out to be an older man who knows some of the young people, and arranges business trips so that he can hang out with them from time to time.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs about what was going on in the world ‚Äî Vietnam, the Arab/Israeli conflict, drugs, music ‚Äî and about the characters. They aren‚Äôt that well developed ‚Äî indeed, he largely abandons character development after the first six chapters where he introduces each one ‚Äî but those introductions are enough to see us through.</p>\n<p>Actually, thinking about it now, I wish he had written more about some of them.

Sadly, after <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/11/30/a-five-and-four-zeroes/\">last year‚Äôs success</a>, this year <a href=\"https://nanowrimo.org/participants/devilgate/novels/delta-blues-beat-poet-of-the-spaceways/stats\">I failed</a>.</p>\n<p>As you‚Äôll have seen if you clicked through to look at my stats, I averaged 595 words per day, for a total of 17,800. It‚Äôs not nothing, and it‚Äôs still a decent start on the new novel, but it‚Äôs nothing like last year.</p>\n<p>Why did I fail? A better question is, why was I successful last year? This year‚Äôs result is comparable to other years when I‚Äôve tried it. Last year‚Äôs success looks like the aberration.</p>\n<p>The big difference between last year and any other was my commute. I‚Äôve tended always to have a commute of about an hour ‚Äî except when I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/02/recent-events-2/\">worked at the bank in the City</a>, when it was shorter. Last year I was working in Croydon, which took me an hour and a half or more to get to. The one good point was that, picking up the Overground from Dalston Junction, I nearly always got a seat within a few stops. And on the way back had one from the start (coming from West Croydon, which is the start of the line).</p>\n<p>So I was able to get forty or fifty minutes of concentrated writing time in each direction. Add to that the fact that the office I was in was really horrible, so I didn‚Äôt want to spend my lunch hours in it. I mostly went out and wrote in cafes or at <a href=\"https://www.boxpark.co.uk/croydon/\">Boxpark Croydon</a>. The one thing I miss about that job is the the places to eat, especially a little pizza place in Boxpark.</p>\n<p>Whereas now, working at Imperial, I‚Äôm back to a one-hour commute, with much less guarantee of a seat. And I really like both job and office, so I‚Äôm quite happy to go back there after I‚Äôve got my lunch.</p>\n<p>One other point is that last year I had worked out how I was going to end the novel I had been working on for years, so I was running downhill towards that end. This year, starting a brand-new one ‚Äî even though I‚Äôve got a plan, it feels much more uphill.</p>\n<p>Still, we press on, writers against procrastination, borne forward ceaselessly into the future.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It is, in case you don‚Äôt know, a film from 1980 about and featuring The Clash. It‚Äôs kind of a fictionalised documentary, in that the titular character, Ray Gange, is both someone who was a sometime roadie for/hanger-on of The Clash, and playing the part of ‚ÄúRay Gange.‚Äù<sup id=\"fnref-5250-Gange\"><a href=\"#fn-5250-Gange\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The worst part of it is, as I recalled, his ‚Äúacting.‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs not quite true.

And indeed the organised racism of the National Front rally shown at the start.</p>\n<p>Also bad are the violence from police and bouncers, and the general horribleness of Britain in the seventies.

And we won‚Äôt get them back after Brexit.</p>\n<p>Also, in looking up the IMDB article, I discover that a) Ray Gange has actually been in a couple of other movies, and b) far more importantly, there is a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081441/\">2016 movie called <cite>London Town</cite></a>, which is a drama about those times.

Look at this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Not just Labour, but the whole country is extremely divided at the moment ‚Äî not least because of Brexit. If you could stop Brexit, would you?</p>\n<p>  <strong>Corbyn:</strong> We can‚Äôt stop it. The referendum took place. Article 50 has been triggered.

The will of the people can change, and almost certainly has. And you don‚Äôt agree to a deal with going back and checking that it‚Äôs still OK.

Labour won three general elections under Tony Blair, and was able to do a lot of good. They could have done more, they could have been better, and Blair destroyed his legacy by throwing his lot in with George W Bush and the Iraq War. But those were times when things were improving in the country and we looked to the future with positivity.

It looked like nothing was moving ahead of us. My assumption was that they hadn‚Äôt yet closed all the roads between us and Parliament Square, but there was no way to know for sure. Eventually we started moving.</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2262.jpeg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2262.thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"These noisy bastards were around all day\"></img></a>\n\n<p>The mood was universally peaceful and cheerful. There were hardly any police to be seen.</p>\n<p>I tried to post a couple of photos, but inevitably the network was swamped and nothing would work. I guess even if people weren‚Äôt trying to post, just that many phones trying to register with a cell tower would slow things down dramatically.</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2265.jpeg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2265.thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"An idea of the numbers\"></img></a>\n\n<h2>The Rally</h2>\n\n<p>By the time we got to Whitehall Parliament Square was full, and we couldn‚Äôt get in. The organisers had set up some big screen-and-speaker systems, so we could hear the speeches (at least when the hovering helicopters weren‚Äôt too close).</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2299.jpeg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2299.thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"Wee Nicola on screen\"></img></a>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>There isn‚Äôt one, really. Like I say, the Mayhemic leadership of the country won‚Äôt pay any attention. But if nothing else it helps to keep our spirits up in these dark days.</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2302.jpeg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/10/IMG_2302.thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"rafalgar Square in the aftermath\"></img></a>\n\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect with this. I knew it was about, or set around, a party ‚Äî in part because I‚Äôve seen <cite><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274558/\">The Hours</a></cite>.</p>\n<p>But it‚Äôs about so much more; and not really about the party very much at all. It‚Äôs an intriguing look at the mental lives of a range of people in London on a day in the 1920s. Not a very wide range of people, in that they‚Äôre all very much upper-middle to upper class. There are a few people from what would have been called the lower classes, but they‚Äôre just passersby, background colour. There is, however, a sympathy towards all people ‚Äî from at least some of the characters.</p>\n<p>Given the limited range of types of people, we get a remarkably effective insight into their mental lives. And it‚Äôs all done with reported thought. There is some actual dialogue, but very little. And we jump around from head to head promiscuously, but incredibly smoothly. There‚Äôs usually some handoff: the current viewpoint character sees someone, and then we‚Äôre in that person‚Äôs head. Or they might just think about someone, and now we hear the other person‚Äôs thoughts.</p>\n<p>I guess this, along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce\">Joyce</a>, is one of the originators of the stream of consciousness as a literary device. An  interesting thing to me is how it reminded me of other, later, works; which of course shows its influence. Most noticeable: <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/04/10/the-illuminatus-trilogy-by-robert-shea-and-robert-anton-wilson-books-2018-7/\">Illuminatus</a>!</cite> Now <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson\">Robert Anton Wilson</a> was a Joyce scholar, so he was probably coming more from that direction, but there are definitely some similarities of style, or at least echoes.</p>\n<p>And ‚Äî also from this year‚Äôs rereading ‚Äî <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/08/01/walking-on-glass-by-iain-banks-books-2018-18/\">Walking On Glass</a></cite>. Especially in the contrast between the thoughts of people who are or are not ‚Äúsane.‚Äù</p>\n<p>It can be surprisingly confusing at times, such as when someone suddenly thinks  of a person or an idea that hasn‚Äôt been mentioned before. But that just simulates the way our minds work. Our thoughts jump from topic to topic without an introductory paragraph, after all.</p>\n<p>So it‚Äôs psychology, feminism, and a critique of (parts of) the British class system. Oh, and it‚Äôs also partly a love-letter to London. I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I don‚Äôt know where I learned about this. It‚Äôs been sitting on my Kindle for a while. I have a feeling that a friend recommended it on Facebook. It‚Äôs subtitled ‚ÄúAn Hallucinated Oral History of the Post-Punk Scene in Airdrie, Coatbridge and Environs 1978‚Äì1986,‚Äù which annoys me, but only because of that ‚Äú<strong>An</strong> Hallucinated.‚Äù Not because it‚Äôs a subtitle. I like subtitles.</p>\n<p>And this subtitle describes its book extremely well, especially with respect to that incorrectly-articled vision. It‚Äôs the fictionalised biography of a band called Memorial Device. Or at least that‚Äôs partly what it is. It verges on magic realism at times. It‚Äôs presented as a series of interviews and parts written by other contributors (as opposed to the supposed author, ‚ÄúRoss Raymond‚Äù). The actual author does a fine job of presenting those different voices and making them <em>sound</em> different. The whole thing reads like an actual music biography where the author has drawn on the experiences of a range of people as well as their own experience.</p>\n<p>The hallucinatory part comes from the way some of those people speak, or write. They are variously damaged or otherwise otherworldly, and their mental strangeness comes across well ‚Äî or is it the world that‚Äôs strange?</p>\n<p>Airdrie is in the west of Scotland, not far from Glasgow, so it‚Äôs very much the same part of the world I grew up in. This feels very realistic: there was a similar swathe of bands inspired by punk and the post-punk/new wave/new romantic scene around Dumbarton and environs. None of the characters were as much larger-than-life as some of the members of Memorial Device ‚Äî or at least not that I knew ‚Äî but that‚Äôs why this is fictional, I guess.</p>\n<p>Not the best thing I‚Äôve read this, year, but not bad.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Gutenberg is a change to the web-based editor in the WordPress dashboard, not a separate app. I typed up my <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/09/01/chile-trip-part-1-there-and-back/\">previous post</a> in <a href=\"https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/\">MarsEdit</a>, as is my wont, and uploaded it.

				"title": "Chile Trip Part 1: There and Back",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>We‚Äôre not long back from a family holiday to Chile. I plan to write several posts about it. I‚Äôm going to take a thematic approach, rather than a purely chronological or location-based one. Though some will be that kind, too. There will be pictures, but not so much in this post, as it‚Äôs about planes, airports, etc.</p>\n<p>First, then, the whole business of travelling to another continent, and to the southern hemisphere of our amazing planet.</p>\n<h2>Getting There</h2>\n<p>We flew on Latin American Airlines, or LATAM. They were pretty good. I have no complaints. Maybe not as good as British Airways to New York a few years ago, but certainly much better than the budget airlines. The only thing was that we couldn‚Äôt get a direct flight. There just don‚Äôt seem to be any to Santiago. Though a taxi driver told us towards the end of our stay that BA have one direct flight a week. If so, then either we didn‚Äôt find it, it was on an inconvenient day, or it was really expensive. Or any combination of those.</p>\n<p>So we had a multipart flight out: first to S√£o Paulo, then on to Santiago via Rosario. That was just a stop at another airport, without leaving the plane. Though some confusion in the booking system meant that we had different seats for the second part. We were not alone: it was all a bit chaotic, as new people boarded and wanted to sit in already-occupied seats, as people who were staying on didn‚Äôt realise they had to move. Still, it got sorted out.</p>\n<p>Also I didn‚Äôt realise till later that Rosario is actually in Argentina. It doesn‚Äôt count as visiting a country if you stay airside, but still, interesting to have touched down in two more countries than we planned to.</p>\n<p>Above all, it‚Äôs a <em>long</em> journey. Around 6000 miles, and about 22 hours, if memory serves.</p>\n<h2>Jet Lag</h2>\n<p>We didn‚Äôt suffer too much from jet lag going out. Except‚Ä¶ almost every day for the entire three weeks I woke up around 4 in the morning. Usually got back to sleep OK. Our clock-time confusion was confounded after about a week when the clocks in Chile went forward by an hour. It‚Äôs the tail end of winter there, so it‚Äôs the start of summer time. But it‚Äôs earlier than when clocks in Europe change, relatively. Also it was <em>only</em> Chile: in Bolivia and Brazil the time was unchanged.</p>\n<h2>Taxis Home and Abroad</h2>\n<p>While I‚Äôm on travel I‚Äôll just touch on taxis. Chilean taxi drivers, in common with those all over Europe, get out of their car and help you load your bags into the boot. This happens everywhere; except Britain. Or at least, except London. When we were getting a cab when we were coming home I was struck by the fact that all these people were struggling into the stupidly-designed-for-luggage black cabs with no help from the driver.</p>\n<p>And then I was ashamed when it was our turn, and the driver <em>did</em> get out and help us. But it‚Äôs uncommon.</p>\n<h2>Internal Flights</h2>\n<p>Chile is distinctive on the map for its length. It runs almost the entire length of the continent. So there are some long distances to travel if you want to see much of it. As it is, I couldn‚Äôt say that we saw <em>much</em> of it, but we did see some very distinctive areas. Notably the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert\">Atacama Desert</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Lagos_Region\">Lakes region</a>.</p>\n<p>They‚Äôre quite far apart, though, so we took some internal flights. All by LATAM (we should have signed up for their frequent-flyer programme), and all fine. Security at the airports was generally less intrusive than it is here. We didn‚Äôt have to take iPads out of carry-ons, and I once went through security with my metal water bottle full! Radical.</p>\n<h2>Long(ish) Distance Buses</h2>\n<p>The only other trip we took was from Santiago to Valpara√≠so, which was by bus (coach). A couple of hours. Very comfortable, if you could avoid hitting your head on the badly-designed overhead screens.</p>\n<h2>Santiago Metro and Valpara√≠so Light Rail</h2>\n<p>Santiago has a decent Metro system. You get a contactless card like London‚Äôs Oyster cards, called <em>Bip!</em>. Which is a great name, in my humble opinion. It also has the advantage over Oyster that you can make multiple journeys simultaneously with one card. So for a family of four, for example, you just put enough money on the card for everyone, and tap in four times.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt really know why Oyster doesn‚Äôt support this. My only guess would be that they thought it would cause too many complaints with people accidentally being charged twice.</p>\n<h2>Return</h2>\n<p>Coming back took even longer: 23 hours in airports and planes, but 27, 28, if you count getting to and from the airports.</p>\n<p>The weird thing here was that we flew from Santiago to Rio de Janeiro; then, after a four or five hour stopover, to S√£o Paulo. An hour and a half there, and finally on to Heathrow. I don‚Äôt understand why it was like that, but as I recall it was the only available option when we booked the flights.</p>\n<p>The annoying part was that ‚Äî seemingly because the Rio ‚Äì S√£o Paulo bit was a domestic flight ‚Äî we had to collect our luggage in Rio, and then check it back in. We went landside, got Brazilian entry stamps in our passports, all that.</p>\n<p>We took off for Heathrow at 22:10, which made it 02:10 in the UK. So I wanted to get to sleep, but first I wanted to eat. On these long flights, though, they don‚Äôt rush to serve food like they do on a short European flight. So it was, I think, around 4 am before I could close my eyes.</p>\n<p>Adjusting back home wasn‚Äôt too bad, though. People always say it‚Äôs worse coming east, but, apart from sleeping late on Bank Holiday Monday, I didn‚Äôt have too much trouble.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

But when I was about a third through this, I had a dawning realisation: this appeared not to be science fiction.  The Clarke Award being for the best <em>SF</em> novel of the year, of course.</p>\n<p>At that point there were, to my reckoning, two things that don‚Äôt quite exist in the real world today: a self-driving car, and a kind of personal health sensor that can tell how much you drank last night, and if you‚Äôre pregnant. Neither is key to the plot or anything else, though.</p>\n<p>There was also a hint that global warming has taken a turn for the worse. But it could just be a year with a bad crop, and anyway, that‚Äôs hardly fiction, never mind SF.</p>\n<p>But then I hit part two, and it jumped forward 50 years, with corresponding technological advances. Part three takes us forward another fifty or so years.</p>\n<p>So what we have is a series of vignettes about the experiences of several interlinked families, over a hundred or so years. It‚Äôs interesting enough, but it‚Äôs limited. It‚Äôs about families and the future of how humans conceive, bear (or not), and raise children. Which is fine. But there‚Äôs very little about what else is going on in the world, in society. Or even much about the societal effects of the technologies we <em>are</em> looking at. Yes, by the end there are reports of a visibly-pregnant woman being abused in public for giving her baby a bad start in life (by not using the artificial uterus technology and associated genetic cleansing). But that‚Äôs it.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs interesting enough, as far as it goes, but I‚Äôve got to admit I‚Äôm surprised the judges considered it the best SF novel published in Britain in 2017.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>A novel of three parts. Two of them are ‚Äî probably ‚Äî tightly linked. By some interpretations, anyway. The third ‚Äî which is the first as presented ‚Äî brushes up against one of those two, and is to a small extent influenced by it. But in no way that I can discern is it really linked to the others. Which kind of makes me wonder what it‚Äôs for.</p>\n<p>I mean, sure, maybe he just wanted to tell that story, with no more reason than that. That would be fine. But since the three are presented under one common title, I‚Äôve got to assume that they share more than just a passing brush with simultaneous walks and some sugar in a tank.</p>\n<p>The title itself is interesting. The only people who are literally walking on glass at any point are the two exiles from a galactic war in the far future (if that‚Äôs really what they are). But glass suggests fragility, slipperiness: maybe everyone is walking on glass, as everything could collapse under them at any moment.</p>\n<p>It also suggests transparency: maybe everyone can be seen at any time. If you walk on a sheet of glass, you can be viewed from below. Which sounds not unlike the crosstime telepathic viewing that people in the castle are apparently doing of people in Earth‚Äôs past.</p>\n<p>All of which leads me to the conclusion ‚Äî which I didn‚Äôt actually expect when I started writing this ‚Äî that my long-preferred interpretation is the correct one: that Quiss and Ajayi really are former warriors who have been banished to the castle as a punishment for misdeeds. The castle has the technology to let people live vicariously in the minds of humans from its past. At one point Quiss probably touches Grout‚Äôs mind and partly causes the road accident.</p>\n<p>Is Grout really an exile from the same war, or a similar one? Probably not, but maybe. Maybe someone like Quiss or Aliya touched his mind at some earlier, vulnerable time, and something of their experience passed in to Grout.</p>\n<p>But again, what of Graham‚Äôs story, and Sara‚Äôs betrayal? What does that have to do with the bigger stories?</p>\n<p>I remain unsure.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Like this function or this expression; or my typical thing, ‚Äúwould this work‚Äù or how the fuck was that syntax again?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôve sometimes found that they have a downside. When you are looking for code examples, then if a language has a REPL, very often the examples show the use of a feature <em>in</em> the REPL. Which may be fine, but is not so helpful if you‚Äôre trying to find out how to construct a class or a function.</p>\n<p>Which point, to be fair, Hjertnes does address:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  In other words, if your language require a lot of ‚Äúforeplay‚Äù to run code, like declaring a namespace and a class etc (I‚Äôm looking at you Java and C#) it will probably not be the right thing. But if you can evaluate code without much fuss it is.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Java is supposed to be getting one soon, I believe, if it‚Äôs not already in version 9.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Outside of TV companies, at least.</p>\n<p>Still a great, crazy story with an ending that, now, seems less believable than it ever did.

I was a little late. I went straight to Oxford Circus. I came out of the tube station and just stood and watched the people walking down Regent Street. It was amazing, and seemed endless. Then I saw these two with great signs:</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1911.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1911.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protestors with signs: 'If Adolph (sic) Hitler flew in today...

Anyway, if so, it was the biggest since the Iraq war demo. More amusingly, we were a bigger crowd than at Trump‚Äôs inauguration.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I looked around and it didn‚Äôt feel that crowded. I‚Äôve seen the O2 full, and I would guess that there were a similar 20,000 in the square.</p>\n\n<p>But it turned out when I left that there were many, many people in the streets around the square. I guess they didn‚Äôt want to push forward because the square looked full. I‚Äôm quite glad about that.</p>\n\n<p>The atmosphere was fantastic all day. The police presence was pleasingly low (or at least low-key), despite the stories of leave being cancelled and people drafted in from all over the country.</p>\n\n<p>Did it do any good?

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>This is not a book about an imaginary rock musician: it‚Äôs a book about guilt.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is about an imaginary rock musician too, but reading it now, for the third or perhaps fourth time, it‚Äôs striking to me how totally it‚Äôs about guilt. And not very subtly, either. It‚Äôs right there at the start of chapter 2:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Guilt. The big G, the Catholic faith‚Äôs greatest gift to humankind and its subspecies, psychiatrists . . . well, I guess that‚Äôs putting it a little too harshly; I‚Äôve met a lot of Jews and they seem to have just as hard a time of it as we do, and they‚Äôve been around longer\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I had forgotten that the character of Daniel Weir (or ‚ÄúWeird‚Äù) was brought up as a Catholic. I don‚Äôt think any of Banksie‚Äôs other characters were. The man himself wasn‚Äôt. Not that it makes a lot of difference: his (and our) Scottishness has a lot more impact on his character ‚Äî and his characters ‚Äî than any religion his parents may have had.</p>\n<p>As always, I had forgotten some key parts, but I remembered more of this than of most. It‚Äôs still great.</p>\n<p>And I realise that these notes are becoming more about me, and what I remember, than about the books. But that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs my blog, after all, and as much as anything these <em>are</em> for me. They‚Äôre just out there in public in case anyone else is interested.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you haven‚Äôt read any Banks, then this would be a damn fine place to start. Though it‚Äôs interesting to note that ‚Äî set as it is in the 70s and early 80s ‚Äî it‚Äôs so dated that it feels almost like a period piece. One example: one of the members of the band buys an IBM mainframe and transfers recording-studio tapes to it, so he can play any track at the touch of a button. Something we can do from our pocket computers today.</p>\n<p>But there was one point that I thought seemed anachronistic. Maybe not, but aluminium takeaway cartons? Chinese &amp; curries? In 1973? Hmmm. I mean, it is in the foaming metropolis of Paisley, not Balloch. And even we had a Chinese by 1980, 81, or so. Still, I wonder when those things started to become commonplace.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I think I‚Äôve read it twice before, but (and you won‚Äôt be surprised here if you‚Äôve been following along) I don‚Äôt remember much about it.</p>\n<p>I didn‚Äôt recall, for example, that Sharrow, the protagonist, was a noble; or that it‚Äôs set as we approach the decamillenium on and around what I at first assumed to be an Earth colony, although one that is long detached from Earth. And it‚Äôs in a similar state to the last one I read, <cite>Feersum Endjinn</cite>, in that we‚Äôre in a decadent stage, where technology was more advanced in the past, but things have been lost or forgotten.</p>\n<p>The most notable example of that, of course, is the Lazy Gun, the big maguffin at the heart of the story. I had thought it was semi-mystical, or at least alien in origin. But now I think maybe not, it‚Äôs just from the more advanced past.</p>\n<p>Turns out it‚Äôs not anything to do with Earth, of course. Golter is a planet round an extra-galactic star. The million-light-year distance to any other star seems to be the ‚Äúdark background‚Äù of the title. Though I still don‚Äôt really get why it‚Äôs called that.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I still loved it. And strangely the ending felt less bleak than I had remembered. Though it‚Äôs still pretty dark. And it turns out he <a href=\"http://www.rulit.me/books/against-a-dark-background-epilogue-read-290563-1.html\">published an epilogue online</a>.

But if you‚Äôre running a big software platform, you might update your servers constantly‚Äîmany times a day or every 20 minutes.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>is a bit over the top. There were a lot of changes between sending out floppies and continuous deployment.</p>\n<p>I question his (lack of) capitalisation. The command is <code>git</code>, all lower case. But if you‚Äôre talking about the application, you should spell it ‚ÄúGit‚Äù, with the capital. I think so, anyway. You would write about ‚ÄúCVS‚Äù, even though the command was (is) <code>cvs</code>; and ‚ÄúSubversion,‚Äù with the command <code>svn</code>. But at least it‚Äôs not as annoying as people who write it in all-caps.</p>\n<p>Lastly, when he says, ‚ÄúComputers are mercurial,‚Äù I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs wryly referencing what was once <a href=\"https://www.mercurial-scm.org\">Git‚Äôs major rival</a> in the distributed version-control space.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Email apps, especially ones that offer advanced services like ‚Äúsend later,‚Äù may be storing our usernames and passwords on their servers.</p>\n<p>To be clear what that means: if you use Gmail, for example, you put your Google username and password into the app when you set it up. You expect the app to store them securely on your device. But some apps may also be storing that username and password ‚Äî your keys to all the Google services in this example ‚Äî on computers owned by the company that makes the app. Computers over which neither you nor Google has any control.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not suggesting that the company I talk about below, or any other, is doing anything nefarious. They <em>need</em> to be able to log in to your mail server in order to send your mail later. But I hadn‚Äôt realised until now what that means, and I‚Äôm guessing neither will a lot of people.  And to my mind they don‚Äôt make what they‚Äôre doing clear enough.</p>\n<p>Worst of all, having passwords stored on unknown servers ‚Äî at the very least, that‚Äôs worrying.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/connected/194\">episode194</a> of the <cite>Connected</cite> podcast, <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/people/mykehurley\">Myke Hurley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/people/federicoviticci\">Federico Viticci</a> were reviewing the latest version of the iOS (and Mac) app <a href=\"https://sparkmailapp.com\">Spark</a>. It‚Äôs a fine email app, which I was using on my iPhone and iPad. So I was alarmed when they mentioned in passing that mail handled by the app is routed through <a href=\"https://readdle.com\">Readdle‚Äôs</a> servers. That didn‚Äôt seem likely at first. Spark is an email <em>client</em>. You tell it what servers handle your mail, and it connects to them to receive and send. The servers belonging to the company that makes the app have no business getting involved in that.</p>\n<p>I did some digging. Whether or not <a href=\"https://mykewasright.com\">Myke was right</a>‚Ñ¢ about mail going through their servers, the reality turned out to be much worse.</p>\n<h2>Digging</h2>\n<p>I tweeted at the Spark account.

Without such access, our Product won‚Äôt be able to provide you with the necessary communication experience. In order for you to take full advantage of additional App and Service features, such as ‚Äúsend later‚Äù, ‚Äúsync between devices‚Äù and where allowed by Apple ‚Äì ‚Äúpush notifications‚Äù we use Spark Services. Without using these services, none of the features mentioned above will function.\n</blockquote>\n<p>The wording ‚ÄúSpark requires your credentials to log into your mail system in order to receive, search, compose and send email messages‚Äù suggests that Spark the <em>app</em> needs to log into your server, which it does. But nothing about that says that your credentials will be stored on their servers.</p>\n<p>Further down, in point 4, ‚ÄúHow Long Personal Data is Stored For,‚Äù in a table that includes ‚ÄúType of information,‚Äù we see (emphasis mine) :</p>\n<blockquote>\n  Email address, email content for Spark Services, <strong>mail server credentials</strong>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So there it is. They do store your username and password on their servers, and they do tell you; though only if you read well into the kind of document that notoriously goes unread.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>For features like ‚Äúsend later‚Äù they need to store the fact that you want to send an email at a specific time, and log in to your server in order to send it. And to be fair, I‚Äôm sure they can‚Äôt be alone in keeping that kind of data. Lots of clients offer ‚Äúsend later‚Äù and similar services, and all of them will have to log in to your mail server to work. So they have to store your credentials on <em>their</em> servers to do it.</p>\n<p>And consider, if you use Gmail, that means your username and password not just for Gmail, but for <em>all</em> Google‚Äôs services, are now stored on somebody else‚Äôs servers. Their security might be great, but how do we know?</p>\n<p>The more I think about this, the more concerned I become. Passwords should only be stored in one place: a secure, trusted password manager. But above all, these services need to be much clearer about the fact that they‚Äôre storing our passwords.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Two album-related memes have been doing the rounds on Facebook lately. Both involve posting cover images of ten favourite albums across ten days. One involves doing so without any comment, but the more interesting one to me involves the poster writing about their thoughts on each album. I was nominated by my friend <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006622569425\">Peter</a> to join in with the long-form version.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm all about owning my own content, as you know, and not having it locked away in Facebook‚Äôs walled garden. So my plan is to write about ten albums, but to do so here, on my blog. Links to the posts will automatically be crossposted to Facebook anyway.</p>\n<p>I started compiling a list of possibles, and thinking about starting to write posts. First I decided to restrict it one per artist. Otherwise I could just pick five by The Beatles and five by The Clash.</p>\n<p>But then I played some albums, and thought some more.</p>\n<p>See, I knew right up front that it was going to be almost entirely a white-guy fest. I wanted to approach it honestly, and not try to appear to be anything I‚Äôm not, so that‚Äôs how it would have to be. It would be reflecting my life as a music fan. As it stands the long list has one woman and no non-white people.</p>\n<p>But as I played those albums ‚Äî albums I love ‚Äî and as I thought about them, I realised two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I know these albums too well. I‚Äôm not <em>bored</em> of them, but they can drift past without me really being aware of them, through overfamiliarity.</li>\n<li>This won‚Äôt be very interesting, and certainly won‚Äôt have any surprises for anyone who knows me.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So I‚Äôve come to a decision, I think: I‚Äôm going to do it slightly differently. I‚Äôm going to write about ten albums that I like <em>now</em>. Ones that I‚Äôve discovered in the last few years, maybe, or that I‚Äôve known for a while but have listened to a lot more in recent years.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not entirely sure what that list is going to look like. I only have two, maybe three definites on it at the moment, and it‚Äôs going to take a while to construct it. But I think it could be a much more interesting list ‚Äî certainly for me ‚Äî when it‚Äôs done.</p>\n<p>And I‚Äôll do a post with a rundown of what the original list <em>would</em> have been, just for completeness.</p>\n<p>So watch out for those in the next few days.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>This is a great story about how some people have to fix things in the aftermath of something they did that may change the world fundamentally, if not destroy it. With that description it sounds very similar to Ellis‚Äôs earlier webcomic (with Paul Duffield), <a href=\"http://www.freakangels.com\">Freak Angels</a>.</p>\n<p>Which is a fair enough assessment, though the triggering event in this case is a combination of AI, the internet, and old magic; as opposed to the psychic powers in the older work. Ellis has deeply embedded the ‚Äústart late‚Äù advice often given to aspiring authors. Both of the works under discussion, and some of his others, start long after the events that set their plots in motion.</p>\n<p>It can be a very effective device. We get to know characters who already know each other, and the past events are revealed gradually, through conversation and flashbacks. And the fact that the protagonists don‚Äôt at first fully understand what they did means that we learn along with them.</p>\n<p>This is great, but the only frustrating thing is that these three volumes ‚Äî comprising fifteen issues of the comic ‚Äî are to date all that there is. I don‚Äôt know if they plan to continue it, but the last issue came out in November, and the story is far from over. Googling has not so far revealed the answer to this.</p>\n<p>Recommended, though.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"title": "Tab Convert",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>That‚Äôs <strong>con</strong>vert, with the stress on the first syllable. The noun, in other words. As in, ‚ÄúI am a tab convert.‚Äù A convert, that is, to using tabs for indentation of source code, instead of spaces.</p>\n<h2>A Background of Spaces</h2>\n<p>From the earliest time that I learned about the tabs vs spaces debate, I‚Äôve been a spaces guy. This is at least partly because of the influence of my then-colleague <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/author/benjamin-geer\">Benjamin Geer</a>. He has gone on to other, no doubt better, things, but he was probably the best programmer I‚Äôve ever worked with. He introduced me to the idea that you should always use four spaces for indentation. The reason being that if you use tabs, people can have their editor‚Äôs tab size set to all sorts of different values, and it leads to source files not looking as you expect them to.</p>\n<p>Whereas spaces are spaces: you can‚Äôt go wrong with a space (or four).</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve changed, though. I have become a convert, in my job, and maybe philosophically, to tabs.</p>\n<h2>Stack Overflow Survey</h2>\n<p>About a year ago there was a <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017\">survey of developers on Stack Overflow</a>. Among many questions, they asked about whether people used spaces or tabs. The <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/\">detail that got most attention</a> was that developers who use spaces were paid more on average than those who use tabs. I strongly suspect that correlation is not causation in this case, but it seemed noteworthy at the time.</p>\n<p>More interesting to me was the fact that <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#work-tabs-or-spaces\">more people used tabs</a>, at 42.9% against 37.8%. I was surprised: I thought spaces had won years ago. Though I often wondered (<a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/04/28/3353/\">sometimes publicly</a>, and I‚Äôm surprised to see that was only last year) why the default setting for Eclipse was tabs.</p>\n<p>Maybe that default, and others like it, is part of the reason for the statistics. Most people don‚Äôt change defaults. On the other hand, surely developers are the kind of people who are <em>most likely</em> to change defaults?</p>\n<p>Anyway, after the survey came out there were various posts about it, notably <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/15/spaces-vs-tabs\">John Gruber</a>, who said he was ‚Äúa devout user of tabs‚Äù. OK, he‚Äôs not a developer these days, but there were others who are who said similar things. The one that struck me was one that I can‚Äôt locate now that said ‚Äútabs are semantic.‚Äù In other words, pressing the tab key means ‚Äúindent here.‚Äù Four spaces means‚Ä¶ four spaces? Could be an indentation, could be something else.</p>\n<h2>Everything Changes Imperially</h2>\n<p>So I was primed for the idea of switching to tabs, even though I still used spaces in <a href=\"http://tinlion.software/products/pertwee/\">my own projects</a>. And then I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/03/03/imperial-adventures/\">started my new job at Imperial College</a>. When I first started looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility\">the code</a>, I quickly realised that it was indented with tabs throughout. I checked with my co-worker who is the main contributor. He didn‚Äôt mind, but they had always used tabs.</p>\n<p>Obviously I didn‚Äôt want to introduce a mixture. That‚Äôs what <em>really</em> messes up the display of code in different editors. You have to be consistent within a project. So if I were to change the project to spaces I would have to change every file. That was an unnecessary step; and per the above, I was primed to use tabs. They‚Äôre semantic, after all.</p>\n<p>I switched my IDE to indent using tabs, with the tab-stop value set to 4. And so we proceed, tabbing away merrily.</p>\n<p>So far I prefer it this way.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Trilogy</cite></a>. As clearly are Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, or the KLF, as they used to be known. This book is ‚Äî what, a spoof of, a homage to? ‚Äî <cite>Illuminatus</cite>. Explicitly modelled on it, referring back to it constantly.</p>\n<p>Plus there are lots of Beatles references, and I‚Äôve been into them for even longer. Then among the characters are Alan Moore, who (in this corner of the multiverse) is a member ‚Äî along with Cauty and Drummond ‚Äî of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Noise_Terror\">Extreme Noise Terror</a>. Our world‚Äôs version of that band did collaborate with the KLF, but as far as I can tell they had no connection with Moore.</p>\n<p>So don‚Äôt expect to get too much accurate information about popular culture out of this. Plenty of references, though. Other characters include Michelle O‚ÄôBama, M‚ÄôLady Gaga, Yoko Ono (two versions), Lady Penelope, and her chauffeur/hitman Aloysius Parker.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a lot of fun. The downside is that it‚Äôs not very well written, at least as far as the dialogue is concerned. Most notable is the complete absence of contractions. Which is fine for an odd thing, or maybe to give one character a particular voice, but when no-one uses them, it all gets a little strange.</p>\n<p>The story is fun, though, and I finished it and immediately started rereading <cite>Illuminatus</cite> yet again, so there‚Äôs that.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It was very satisfying to take the failing <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing\">tests</a> from 600 down to 490 with a single commit. That‚Äôs 600 failing tests out of 800. And looking at what‚Äôs there, it‚Äôs hard to see how some of them could ever have passed. I sort of get the impression that a whole lot might have been written but never run.</p>\n<p>That big win involved nothing more than changing a class from being <a href=\"http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html\">all static methods</a> to being one that you can instantiate, and then passing in a test version of a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html\"><code>ResourceBundle</code></a>, instead of trying to read a properties file which wasn‚Äôt there in my setup.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the people are nice. The commute is shorter than to Croydon, by a good half hour. But it‚Äôs a lot more crowded on the Circle Line than I remember from two years ago when I was at Misys.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Just over a month ago I posted a <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/02/01/4158/\">brief note</a> about job news, saying that more details would be forthcoming. I was, as I said then, just waiting for some paperwork.</p>\n<p>It took longer than I expected to get that paperwork sorted out, but I received and returned the contract yesterday afternoon. On Monday I start work at the <a href=\"http://www.sahsu.org\">Small Area Health Statistics Unit</a> (SAHSU), part of the School of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs quite a mouthful, but in short I‚Äôll be working on programming something called the <a href=\"https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility\">The Rapid Inquiry Facility</a> (RIF), which is an open-source tool for studying health statistics.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm neither a medical researcher nor a statistician, but I am a programmer (or a software engineer, if you want to be fancy). Our job is to understand the needs of someone ‚Äî usually referred to as ‚Äúthe business,‚Äù but I‚Äôm guessing that will be different in my new job ‚Äî and translate those needs into actions in software. That basic definition doesn‚Äôt change according to the problem domain. Whether it‚Äôs sending payments from one bank to another, checking a person‚Äôs right to work on a government database, or doing something with statistical data about health issues, the programmer‚Äôs job is to understand what the user needs and make things happen on a screen.</p>\n<p>The big difference for me, I think, will be that in this new role I‚Äôll have the chance to contribute to doing something good in the world. As I said at my interview, I‚Äôve mainly worked in financial software, and while, sure, people need banks, it wasn‚Äôt the most socially-usefully thing. The last half-year working at the Home Office had some value, but I was a tiny cog in a huge machine.</p>\n<p>At Imperial I‚Äôll be able to feel that I‚Äôm actually contributing something useful to society, as well as doing what should be really interesting work.</p>\n<p>Oh, and: I‚Äôll be back in Paddington, which I know from my Misys days, and it‚Äôs a much shorter commute than to Croydon.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>You know how they say you shouldn‚Äôt meet your heroes? Well it turns out that sometimes that includes not meeting them between the pages of a book. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd  call Warren Zevon a hero, but he‚Äôs definitely a hugely respected and much missed singer and songwriter.</p>\n<p>I knew of the tales of wild and crazy behaviour, though I hadn‚Äôt actually read any of them ‚Äî except inasmuch as they come out in the songs. And anyway, those tales are a dime a dozen in rock‚Äôn'roll. A lot of this biography, though, is concerned with the people he hurt.</p>\n<p>Which is fine, not least since the author ‚Äî his wife and the mother of one of his children ‚Äî is a major one of those people. Most of his bad behaviour happened while he was an alcoholic ‚Äî or while he was drinking, I suppose I should say, since the standard twelve-step narrative is that you never stop being one. Alcoholics Anonymous helped him to stop, though he eventually stopped going to meetings. He didn‚Äôt drink for seventeen years, and the opening chapter tells us that when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer he had a scotch. Who could blame him for stepping off he wagon at a time like that?</p>\n<p>So he comes across as a far from pleasant character. But my disappointment with the book is more about the complete focus on the man and his relationships, almost to the exclusion of the music.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe man and his relationships‚Äù sounds like an important set of themes to address in a biography. But in the case of a creative person ‚Äî or really any person worthy of a biography ‚Äî a key part of the story of their life is their <em>works</em>. If it‚Äôs a writer you‚Äôll expect to read about their books; a politician, their victories and defeats; a general their battles. And of course, a musician, their music. It would be strange to read a biography of Beethoven or the Beatles that told of their personal lives but largely elided the music.</p>\n<p>Which may be the key: this isn‚Äôt a <em>biography</em>, as such. It makes no attempt to be comprehensive, and there‚Äôs no real narrative. Although there are plenty of reminiscences from Crystal, the vast bulk of the book is reminiscences from people in Zevon‚Äôs life, directly quoted and preceded with their names; almost like a play script. Presumably Crystal interviewed them all, but she herself comes across as just one of the interviewees.</p>\n<p>There are quotes from Zevon‚Äôs diaries, but he either wrote them in a very fragmented, abbreviated way, or they have been heavily edited. An example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Jan. 12, 1975<br>\n    ‚Ä¶ Took Jordan, visited Father at the steam baths. He gave me a handsome Seiko watch and $135 ‚Ä¶ quarreling with Crystal ‚Ä¶ T-Bone came over for spaghetti and I quaffed vodka martinis all night. T-Bone trounced me soundly at chess which surprised and aggravated me, but pleased me, too, by mellowing my lonely-giant-of-the-intellect trip ‚Ä¶ Made love.<br>\n  <br>\n  Jan. 15, 1975<br>\n    ‚Ä¶ Snorted coke which kept Crystal awake all night ‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs thinking of pregnancy and worried about chemicals in her body ‚Ä¶\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>(All ellipses in original.)</p>\n<p>After he gets sober the diary entries become more frequent, which is good. But as a fan of his music, I would have liked to read a lot more about it: its creation, how it was accepted or not at the time, stories of gigs and recording studios, and all that. Unfortunately Crystal wasn‚Äôt really involved in that part of his life, and the interviewees who were ‚Äî like Jorge Calder√≥n or Jackson Brown ‚Äî either weren‚Äôt asked to talk about it, or weren‚Äôt quoted doing so.</p>\n<p>So not quite the music biography I‚Äôd have liked, but not without interest.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Trouble is it‚Äôs now been quite a while since I saw them both.</p>\n<p>Still, I should be able to gather together a few memory cells.</p>\n<h2><cite>The Last Jedi</cite></h2>\n<p>I went on opening night, as <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/12/14/4017/\">I microblogged</a>.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>The worst thing about this book is that it tells you, two or three chapters from the end, that it‚Äôs only the first half of the story. Now, I knew there are two other books in the series, but I expected the first book to be at least capable of standing alone. Turns out it isn‚Äôt: the ending leaves us hanging right after the big reveal.</p>\n<p>The other worst thing about this book is that I‚Äôm not really that compelled to read on. I mean, I probably will, but it‚Äôs not like when I read <cite><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion\">Hyperion</a></cite>, say, and had to scurry around the city trying to find a copy of the second volume.<sup id=\"fnref-6028-Hyperion\"><a href=\"#fn-6028-Hyperion\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>After all the fuss <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/26/publishers-and-sinners/\">about it not being published in the UK, and me not being able to get it</a>, I had high expectations. Probably too high, as it turns out.</p>\n<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong: it‚Äôs by no means a bad book, and it‚Äôs astonishingly accomplished for a first novel. I did enjoy reading it. Its true weakest point‚Äî ignore all that complaining above ‚Äî is that it can be a little bit hard to understand the world she creates. Not impossible, though, and Palmer does go to some efforts to explain it with minimal infodumping. Or at least with infodumping disguised as a conversation with the reader, which works quite well.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs about four hundred years in the future, and since the Church War some two hundred or so earlier, the world no longer exists as countries in the way that we know them. Instead people are members of one of seven ‚Äúhives,‚Äù which they can choose to align themselves with at majority. Or not: some people are hiveless by choice.</p>\n<p>Countries mean less at least in part because of super-fast international transport by ‚Äúcars,‚Äù which I think are probably suborbital rockets or similar. Though they may have a more advanced propulsion system. The most confusing thing is probably that the leaders of the seven hives are characters and each of them has several names. For any given one of them, each of the others might know them by a different nickname, and the narrator uses these interchangeably. It gets hard to keep track of who‚Äôs who.</p>\n<p>Global warming appears to have been conquered, or ameliorated to the point where it‚Äôs not a major concern. In fact it seems to be very close to a post-scarcity society. People only work at things they want to, and seem to be able to live OK without having to work.</p>\n<p>Apart from ‚ÄúServicers,‚Äù that is. Our narrator, Mycroft Canner, is one of these. People convicted of sufficiently serious crimes can end up as one of these. They are essentially public slaves. They are required to work for seemingly anyone who asks them, and are paid in food and board ‚Äî and occasionally other treats such as cinema tickets. But they have no other way to get these things.</p>\n<p>I found it quite a disturbing an idea; though it would almost certainly be better than being in prison; and at least they don‚Äôt have the death penalty.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not the most disturbing thing in the book. But I‚Äôll say no more about that.</p>\n<p>As I write about it, my estimation of it is going up. Isn‚Äôt that strange? If I write enough about it I‚Äôll probably stop to download <cite>Seven Surrenders</cite>, the next volume.</p>\n<p>Oh, yes, as I said, it says it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe first half‚Äù of Canner‚Äôs story; but there are two more volumes. Are they both short, or is the third one more standalone? There‚Äôs only one way to find out.</p>\n<p>But I have a stack of other things to read first. Also I realise I have no idea what the title has to do with the story. üìñ</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-6028-Hyperion\">\nIf memory serves: it was a long time ago, and it may not have happened exactly like that.¬†<a href=\"#fnref-6028-Hyperion\">‚Ü©</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

It's been a while. <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/01/the-year-turns-again/\">That daily posting thing</a> didn't work too well in the latter part of the year, and was particularly weak in the last couple of weeks. Weak weeks.\n\nIn fact I posted 261 times in 2017. It's surprisingly hard to find that kind of thing out from Wordpress itself. I had to dig into the database and run some simple SQL:\n\n```sql\nselect count(*) from devilgate_posts\n  where  post_status = 'publish'\n  and post_type = 'post'\n  and post_date_gmt like '2017%';\n```\n\n261 is 72% of the days of the year, which is not too bad. Certainly the most posts in any year out of the past  fifteen(!)\n\nHere's the monthly breakdown:\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Month</th>\n<th>Posts</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan</td>\n<td>32</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Feb</td>\n<td>33</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mar</td>\n<td>33</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Apr</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>May</td>\n<td>27</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jun</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jul</td>\n<td>21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aug</td>\n<td>17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sep</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oct</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nov</td>\n<td>23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dec</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nA strong start, tapering off in the middle, with a rally in November and then a complete collapse in December. I suspect the last is from a combination of <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/11/30/a-five-and-four-zeroes/\">post-nano slump</a> and the festive season.\n\nIf you're interested, here's the SQL that got me that table:\n\n```sql\nselect\n  date_format(post_date_gmt, '%b') as Month,\n  count(*) as Posts\n  from devilgate_posts\n  where post_status = 'publish'\n  and post_type = 'post'\n  and post_date_gmt like '2017%'\n  group by date_format(post_date_gmt, '%m');\n```\n\nAs to this year, we'll see how it goes.

I was on the other side of the punk/metal wars, of course, and screechy vocals always put me off.</p>\n<p>I completely understand the spirit of that piece, though, and feel the same way about The Clash, the Velvet Underground, probably others. But there is one telling line in it that says something about the different attitudes of the different sides in those not-really wars. I don‚Äôt know, maybe not; but this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  But we thought we were gonna live forever. The music too.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>is not how things were for me, for us. We didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd live beyond the eighties. The nineties at a pinch As Queen put it, we were the ones who:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  grew up tall and proud<br>\n  Under the shadow of the mushroom cloud.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>But so too did the author of the AC/DC piece. He‚Äôs a decade older than me, but that still means he experienced the cold war.</p>\n<p>Maybe it‚Äôs not generation, but location. I lived a few miles from the Faslane naval base, where the Polaris submarines were based (and where the Trident ones are still). We knew we‚Äôd be one of the first places to go.</p>\n<p>Generations are too abstract, too arbitrary to make sweeping statements about in any case. But I still sometimes find myself surprised to be here, now, in this century.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

But I‚Äôm going to have to break ranks with all the legions of newspaper reviewers who love it to death &amp; back (honestly, I can hardly find a bad, or even a mixed, review), and nearly everyone else.</p>\n<p>Because I didn‚Äôt enjoy it all that much. I spent a lot of the time (of which there is a <em>lot</em>) saying, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is going on here? Why did they do that?‚Äù The former is fine, as long as it becomes clear over time, which it generally did. The latter less so: understanding characters‚Äô motivations is fundamental to understanding and enjoying a work of fiction.</p>\n<p>But much worse than those: I spent some of the time bored.</p>\n<p>The main reason for that is that it‚Äôs paced like an 80s movie. Which is to say, much more slowly than we are used to today.</p>\n<p>I should have expected that, I suppose. The original <cite>Blade Runner</cite> moves slowly even by 80s standards. That‚Äôs part of its visual and storytelling style. So it‚Äôs reasonable that a sequel, even one thirty years later, should follow suit. But they could have picked the pace up <em>a bit</em>.</p>\n<p>The reviews all describe it as ‚Äúthought-provoking‚Äù or similar, and it‚Äôs true that the questions of what it means to be human or to be artificial are in there. But to my mind there‚Äôs not enough of that. Which in a way is linked to another problem: world-building.</p>\n<p><aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-right\">\n        <p>It‚Äôs paced like an 80s movie</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside></p>\n<p>As before the world is very visually striking. What we have is the world of <cite>Blade Runner</cite> with thirty years of technological advancements. Like the film, the pace of advancement has been slow, but I suppose that‚Äôs not surprising, given how damaged the world is.</p>\n<p>But slowly or quickly, technology advances in parallel with a conversation <em>about</em> that technology. What‚Äôs missing here is any in-world debate about the legal and ethical status of replicants. Certainly there‚Äôs a nod to the idea that the casual use of ‚Äúskin-job‚Äù is insulting and shouldn‚Äôt be used. But it never seemed that insulting anyway ‚Äî indeed I think it‚Äôs only the voiceover version of the original that tells us it <em>is</em> an insult. Deckard likens it to the n-word. (He does so <em>using</em> that word, which, rightly, would not happen today.)</p>\n<p>In a more realistic world there would be a debate about replicants. There would be rights groups campaigning against using them as slaves, and even for them to be given full citizenship status. And from others there would be discrimination against them, abuse of them. That could all be going on in the background of this society ‚Äî and the debate is not what the film is <em>about</em> ‚Äî but I think a small acknowledgement that the debate existed would at least hint at a richer society.</p>\n<p><aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-left\">\n        <p>Technology advances in parallel with a conversation <em>about</em> that <br />technology.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside></p>\n\n<p>That all applies to the original too, of  course, but now it‚Äôs much more common for the replicants to be living among humans on Earth, so the conversation would be that much more active.</p>\n<p>And speaking of that commonality of the replicants on Earth, one question you might ask is, are there any humans actually left on Earth? Because only two characters appear to be unambiguously human.</p>\n<p>One is K‚Äôs boss in the LAPD, Lt Joshi, who could unknowingly be a replicant, though nothing suggests that. The other, Ana Stelline, who creates the memories that are implanted in replicants. She lives in isolation because of sensitivity to the environment, and the implication is that only a human can provide the memories. But since not all of the memories are actually hers, all that needs is gift for imaginative imagery. And, now that we know that replicants are fully-biological beings who can reproduce (whether only with each other or also with humans is unknown), then anything is possible.</p>\n<p>The situation appears to be that anyone with the money and without any disqualifying problem has left Earth. ‚ÄúA new life awaits you in the offworld colonies,‚Äù after all. I always suspected that the colonies would consist of grinding hardship based on subsistence farming, but I suppose the idea is you have replicant slaves to do the work.</p>\n<p>\n<aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-right\">\n        <p>There are no robots in these <br /> films.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside>\n</p>\n<p>The Earth that we see is incredibly empty. The original‚Äôs LA streets were packed with people, but now it seems sparsely populated at best. Empty highways ‚Äî because of course nobody‚Äôs driving cars anymore. But the air is empty too. Mostly there‚Äôs only ever one car flying at a time. All those giant buildings might be filled with people, but you don‚Äôt get any sense of them being there.</p>\n<p>San Diego is a literal dump, and Las Vegas a nuclear wasteland. Apart from the still-standing casino hotel, of course. A million bottles of whisky and you choose Johnnie Walker Black Label? Come <em>on</em>. (That brand is owned by Diageo, though, which is the first of the big neon advertising signs you see.)</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt know, I wonder if it was just my expectation of something more striking, more startling. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: I didn‚Äôt hate it, or even dislike it. I was just disappointed by it. Yet I think I want to see it again.</p>\n<p>I loved the music, by the way, though it was perhaps a bit overwhelming in places.</p>\n<p>\n<aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-left\">\n        <p>I think I want to see it again.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside>\n</p>\n<p>And as a last thought: I still see people talking about the replicants being ‚Äòrobots‚Äô or ‚Äòandroids.‚Äô If it wasn‚Äôt clear from the first film, where they bled what seemed to be blood, it is powerfully obvious now: there are no robots in these films. The replicants are fully biological. They are probably more like clones, genetically engineered for enhanced strength and stamina.</p>\n<p>The original book had androids (the clue was in the title); but not these films.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I think I might have to develop an app for reading Facebook the way I think it should work.</p>\n<p>There was an article doing the rounds the other week about how ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">our minds can be hijacked</a>,‚Äù which was all about how terrible social networking is for us. I skimmed part of it, but got annoyed when it seemed to be about rich Silicon Valley entrepreneurs deciding to go ‚Äúoff-grid.‚Äù That‚Äôs all very well for them, but most of us have to make a living.</p>\n<p>More pertinently, since the main target for the attack was Facebook, it annoyed me because I use Facebook to keep in touch with people that I might otherwise not. For that, it can be very good.</p>\n<p>And yet‚Ä¶ it struck a chord with, me to some degree. I realised that Facebook has increasingly become more of a time sink than a pleasure. Not that I spend vast amounts of time on it each day, but when I do open it up, I often end up spending longer than I‚Äôd have wanted to. And not reading updates from friends and family, but following links to articles and quizzes and nonsense, most of which I wish I hadn‚Äôt bothered with.</p>\n<p>By comparison, a similar length of time spent in my feed reader lets me read blog pieces by people I actively want to hear from, and which I‚Äôm generally glad I‚Äôve read.</p>\n<p>But they mostly aren‚Äôt friends and family.</p>\n<p>And then there‚Äôs the fact that the Facebook algorithm is tuned to show me what <em>it</em> thinks I should see, not what <em>I</em> want to see. What I want to see is all the updates from my friends, in reverse-chronological order. And that‚Äôs all. But there‚Äôs no guarantee that it will show me everything everyone posts, and the order is close to random at times.</p>\n<p>One way to work round this is to visit people‚Äôs individual Facebook pages. You could see all your the posts by all your friends by going to each of their profiles in turn. But that would mean you‚Äôd have to keep track of all that: remember who you visited and when, and somehow manage the list of people.</p>\n<p>Keeping track of things is what computers are good at. The software should be doing that for us.</p>\n<p>So I‚Äôm thinking that what I want is an app that will do that for me: that will keep a list of my Facebook friends, and show me all their posts (which of course is what Facebook used to do).</p>\n<p>As far as I know, no such app exists. This seems strange and unlikely, but I don‚Äôt think Facebook make a public API available for third-party clients, so such an app would have to work by scraping the web pages, which is neither good practice nor much fun.</p>\n<p>Of course, what this means is effectively turning Facebook back into a set of RSS feeds ‚Äî or now, <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/07/24/some-open-source-software-for-your-delectation/\">especially as I have some experience with them</a>, a set of <a href=\"https://jsonfeed.org/\">JSON Feed feeds</a>. Which would then be usable in all sorts of other places.</p>\n<p>Web scraping may be bad and painful; still, I think I want to write this thing. Watch this space.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It‚Äôs the summer holidays, and we‚Äôre in a holiday home with a TV. That in itself makes me doubt the memory, because back then holiday houses just didn‚Äôt have TVs. A lot of houses in general didn‚Äôt. But this memory has always told me that we were on a family holiday. And it‚Äôs Saturday, late afternoon. I‚Äôm settling down at the TV, and somebody says ‚Äî I think it‚Äôs my sister ‚Äî ‚ÄòMartin, <cite>Doctor Who</cite> finished, remember?‚Äô Because it was <cite>Doctor Who</cite> time.</p>\n<p>And I said, ‚ÄòBut this is <em>like</em> <cite>Doctor Who</cite>!‚Äô</p>\n<p>And as the new programme started someone else ‚Äî my Dad, I think ‚Äî said, with a tone of surprise, ‚ÄòHe knows all about it!‚Äô And then the <cite>Enterprise</cite> swooshed towards me out of the screen.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve long wondered how true this memory was. It was 1969; I‚Äôd have been five. But I just <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/BBC\">checked</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Initially, the BBC was the first-run broadcaster of Star Trek (12 July 1969-15 December 1971).<br>\n  ‚Ä¶<br>\n  The series was shown in four seasons, the first on Saturday evenings at 5:15 pm (in the time slot usually taken by Doctor Who).\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which exactly matches my memory: summer, Saturday, <cite>Doctor Who</cite> slot. And the calendar confirms that the 12th of July 1969 was a Saturday.</p>\n<p>I wouldn‚Äôt be five for another month plus. Not a bad bit of early-memory retention. I wouldn‚Äôt have remembered it at all, if it wasn‚Äôt for one thing: trauma caused by fear that my parents would turn the TV off just as this exciting new programme was starting burned it into my brain.</p>\n<p>My Dad always liked <cite>Star Trek</cite> too, so I guess I was partly responsible for that.</p>\n<h2>Present</h2>\n<p>Yesterday I watched the first two episodes of <cite>Star Trek: Discovery</cite>, which are on Netflix (in the UK and Europe, at least; in the US they‚Äôre on CBS‚Äôs own new streaming service). And I really enjoyed it. I wouldn‚Äôt say it felt like being that nearly-five-year-old again, but it did feel like they‚Äôre trying something new and potentially very exciting.</p>\n<p>Today I was looking at <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5171438/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">its entry on IMDB</a>. It turns out there are user-written reviews there, which I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd been aware of before.</p>\n<p>Sadly they are almost universally negative. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not <cite>Star Trek</cite>,‚Äô is a common theme. But there‚Äôs a strong whiff of racism and misogyny coming through. Two non-white women as leads means ‚Äòsocial justice warriors‚Äô are running the show, it seems. Well from what I‚Äôve read of Gene Roddenbery, I think he‚Äôd have been happy to be called a social justice warrior. <cite>Star Trek</cite> was <em>always</em> about diversity and tolerance.</p>\n<h2>Future</h2>\n<p>I don‚Äôt know how many episodes of this new series they have lined up, but I know I‚Äôm looking forward to watching them. So is my inner five-year-old. So would my Dad have been. And so would Gene.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>If you work with plain text, as I prefer to, then you probably try out different text editors from time to time (or, you know, constantly). I recently tried out a nice one called <a href=\"http://www.bear-writer.com\">Bear</a>. It‚Äôs an attractive environment to write in, syncs well between Mac, iPhone, and iPad, has good previewing and exporting features, as well as a host of different themes to suit your preferences. All in all, it‚Äôs got a lot going for it. I used it exclusively for a while, and paid the first month of its subscription.</p>\n<p>But I‚Äôm dropping it.</p>\n<p>The reason why is simple: although it‚Äôs all about plain text notes, it doesn‚Äôt store your notes as plain text <em>files</em>. Instead, it keeps them all in some kind of database and syncs that via iCloud.</p>\n<p>Using iCloud for syncing isn‚Äôt a problem, but locking my notes away in a form that‚Äôs not accessible to any other text editor definitely is.</p>\n<p>Its export features are good, so it‚Äôs not that your notes are locked away irretrievably. But while you‚Äôre using Bear, you can only edit your notes ‚Äî or view them, for that matter ‚Äî <em>in</em> Bear. And that‚Äôs just not how I want to work.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs kind of antithetical to whole plain-text ethos, to my mind. You should be able to switch text editors without having to even think about it. Just open the file in the new editor and get on with it.</p>\n<p>Next I tried the unimaginatively-named <a href=\"https://www.notebooksapp.com\">Notebooks</a>. A similar setup with the syncing, but you can point it at a directory of files on the filesystem. It has its own strangenesses, though, in that it wants to keep tight control of the directory structure, and when you look at the directory in Finder or another text editor, you find it has been polluted with <code>plist</code> files, one for each plain-text file.</p>\n<p>So I dumped that one, too.</p>\n<p>And right now I‚Äôm trying <a href=\"https://ulyssesapp.com\">Ulysses</a>, which is very much of the moment, because it has just switched to subscription-based pricing, and caused much furore in doing so. I happen to also be trying out the <a href=\"https://setapp.com\">SetApp</a> service, which is interesting in itself, and which includes Ulysses as one of the apps it makes available.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs fine, but is also prone to dropping the odd <code>plist</code> file in my folder, I see.</p>\n<p>In the end I‚Äôll probably stick with <a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\">nvAlt</a> for short-form notes on the Mac, using a folder synced via Dropbox, and <a href=\"http://omz-software.com/editorial/\">Editorial</a> on iOS. Not forgetting <a href=\"https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/\">Drafts</a> on iOS, of course, but you only type things there to export them somewhere else, really. And then <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html\">BBEdit</a> or <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a> for longer pieces.</p>\n<p>Those last two might become the subject of another piece, about how I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so great about BBEdit.  But that‚Äôs for another time.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Yes, this is <em>that</em> long.</p>\n<nav id=\"TOC\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#calling-the-election\">Calling the Election</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#the-fixed-term-parliaments-act\">The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#brexit\">Brexit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#saving-the-nhs\">Saving the NHS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#thoughts-on-corbyn-past-present\">Thoughts on Corbyn, past &amp; present</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#around-the-referendum\">Around the Referendum</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#post-referendum\">Post Referendum</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-big-improvement\">The Big Improvement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#manifesto-destiny\">Manifesto Destiny</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#back-to-brexit\">Back to Brexit</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#may-madness\">May Madness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n<h2 id=\"calling-the-election\">Calling the Election</h2>\n<p>Calling the election at all was at best a cynical ploy by Theresa May. Labour looked weak. She thought she could get a hugely increased majority for relatively little effort. So despite her repeated promises that should would not, she called a general election.</p>\n<p>Now, however, it might have backfired on her. The polls have shifted (though we know we can‚Äôt trust polls). Quite dramatically by some measures. It‚Äôs looking like she might end up with a <em>reduced</em> majority. Or even ‚Äî dare we hope? ‚Äî a radical change. A Labour majority seems implausible, but a hung parliament? That‚Äôs beginning to look a lot like a real possibility.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-fixed-term-parliaments-act\">The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act</h3>\n<p>But what of the act that was supposed to remove prime-ministerial whim from the choice of election date? It turns out it wasn‚Äôt worth the paper it was printed on. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011\">Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011</a> contains a clause that allows the current government to call an election if it has the support of the house.</p>\n<p>Not, I note, with a simple majority. Obviously that would be ridiculous for anything really important. No, a two-thirds majority is needed.</p>\n<p>And was easily obtained, owing to the failure of the opposition to oppose; and now May wants to repeal it anyway. But more on both of those later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brexit\">Brexit</h2>\n<p>When the election was called, my <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/04/18/scattered-thoughts-on-the-general-election/\">initial reaction</a> was that it would be all about Brexit. Nothing else loomed so large. And that was why I had concerns about Labour, because Jeremy Corbyn seemed committed to carrying on the madness that the referendum started.</p>\n<p>I wrote then:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n[P]eople will be torn between voting on the normal things they care about: health, security, homes, welfare, the economy‚Ä¶ ‚Äî and the big thing of our time: Brexit.<br>\n‚Ä¶<br>\nI can‚Äôt in conscience vote for a Labour party that won‚Äôt clearly place itself against Brexit. I just can‚Äôt. This means I have to leave the party, I guess. Corbyn called today for ‚ÄúA Brexit that works for all.‚Äù No, no, no.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I didn‚Äôt leave the party, and though there‚Äôs still some truth in that, things have changed. I‚Äôm not entirely sure when, or how; but somewhere along the line ‚Äî the publication of the manifestos was certainly part of it ‚Äî the normal things began to matter again. They never stopped mattering, of course, but they came back into focus.</p>\n<p>One of the normal things in particular: the NHS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"saving-the-nhs\">Saving the NHS</h2>\n<p>The Tories ‚Äî modern Tories, at least ‚Äî have never really supported it. They have always pushed privatisation of it, or as much of it as possible. Though to be fair, the last Labour government at fault there too, with their public-private partnerships.</p>\n<p>Tories, of course, have pushed for privatisation in everything, not just the NHS, at least since Thatcher. But even Thatcher kept her hands off the NHS. Not so this lot. Thatcher didn‚Äôt leave much to privatise, so their eyes are firmly on the last great publicly owned body.</p>\n<p>I fear that if May‚Äôs lot get back in, especially with an increased majority, we could see the beginning of the end of free universal healthcare in the UK. We are in that much danger.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thoughts-on-corbyn-past-present\">Thoughts on Corbyn, past &amp; present</h2>\n<p>I voted for Corbyn as leader twice. I had my doubts, but he always seemed to be on the right side; and as well, there was no good alternative (not the second time, anyway).</p>\n<h3 id=\"around-the-referendum\">Around the Referendum</h3>\n<p>Then I felt totally let down by Brexit &amp; after. To be fair, his ‚Äútrigger Article 50 now‚Äù comments were slightly misinterpreted, but expressing himself like that just added to the idea that he couldn‚Äôt handle himself with the media.</p>\n<p>And that was certainly true in the first several months. It was like he ‚Äî the party as a whole ‚Äî had no media management at all.</p>\n<p>And at no time did he resist Brexit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"post-referendum\">Post Referendum</h3>\n<p>Then there was a series of mistakes, or bad decisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The three-line whip on the first Article 50 vote.</li>\n<li>Not resisting the invocation of Article 50 at all, even when criticising it.</li>\n<li>Waving through the vote to have the election. Because even if he didn‚Äôt want to stop it, how much better would it have been to make the Tories call a vote of no confidence? If only for the <em>schadenfreude</em>.</li>\n<li>Then he chose not to join the debate because May wasn‚Äôt involved? That‚Äôs what we call missing an open goal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-big-improvement\">The Big Improvement</h3>\n<p>Things have ‚Äî and he has ‚Äî got so much better since then. Somewhere along the line he started to come across as the dignified, statesmanlike man of principle that we knew he was. What changed? Was it better media management, or did the media actually start to give him some proper time?</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt know, but the result is that the polls have turned round dramatically, giving rise to a measure of that most terrifying of things: <em>hope</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"manifesto-destiny\">Manifesto Destiny</h3>\n<p>Everything in the Labour manifesto is better for the country than everything in the Tory one. It‚Äôs as simple as that. ‚ÄúFor the many, not the few‚Äù is the tag line they‚Äôve been using, and it‚Äôs great. Simple, to the point, meaningful. And accurate.</p>\n<p>Not to mention costed. No ‚Äúmagic money tree‚Äù here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"back-to-brexit\">Back to Brexit</h3>\n<p>Although they haven‚Äôt said so, I could see a Labour government offering a second referendum. At least you can imagine them being more open to considering the possibility. Especially, of course, if they were in coalition.</p>\n<p>Now that takes us to the next question: if it‚Äôs a hung parliament, can we trust the LibDems not to back the Tories again?</p>\n<p>I mean, surely, this time‚Ä¶ But that‚Äôs what we thought he last time, and look where that got us. So it‚Äôs a worry. But the LibDems are likely to get some of their old seats back, and Labour almost certainly can‚Äôt get a majority with the way things have changed in Scotland, so a coalition is our best hope.</p>\n<h2 id=\"may-madness\">May Madness</h2>\n<p>Now let‚Äôs turn our attention to our gloryless leader.</p>\n<p>Theresa May has presented an increasingly bizarre face to the world over the last few weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Her ‚ÄúMe, me, me‚Äù approach to presenting Tory policy (‚ÄúIf I lose six seats‚Ä¶‚Äù you only get one); that‚Äôs not how politics in the UK works.</li>\n<li>She wants to reverse the country‚Äôs stumbling steps toward better voting systems, such as the proportional system for the London Mayor.</li>\n<li>Politicising the terrorist attacks:\n<ul>\n<li>first troops on the streets, <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/05/27/losing-the-war-on-terror/\">as I discussed</a>;</li>\n<li>and now she wants to tear up human rights legislation. Next it‚Äôll be internment, I shouldn‚Äôt wonder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She was seemingly scared to debate the other party leaders on TV. Debates may not be quite standard in British elections yet, but that is the way the world was moving.</li>\n<li>Oh, and along with voting reversals, she wants to <em>repeal</em> the fixed-term parliaments act, for what little use it was.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, it seems like she just wants to go backwards to an imagined Little-England past.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It won‚Äôt surprise you in the slightest to hear that I‚Äôm strongly advocating voting <em>against</em> the Tories, in whatever way you can have the most effect. I will be voting Labour, of course, but then I live in one of the safest Labour seats in the country, so that doesn‚Äôt have a lot of effect.</p>\n<p>However, I‚Äôll also be joining other Labour members from Hackney tomorrow in heading over to Westminster North, which is a Labour marginal. I‚Äôll be helping to get out the vote there.</p>\n<p>To you I say, please vote. Vote to stop the Tory mayhem. Vote to save the NHS.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I didn‚Äôt intend to discuss these two episodes of <cite>Doctor Who</cite> together, but watching the first was delayed because I was <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/05/21/3446/\">in Scotland</a> when the first one was on. And I didn‚Äôt realise they were a two-parter.</p>\n<p>Except (spoilers) ‚Äî oh, they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre the first two of an <em>n</em>-parter, where <em>n</em> equals‚Ä¶ who knows? At least three, and I‚Äôm sort of guessing from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_10)\">titles and directors</a> that it might be four.</p>\n<p>Anyway, in them we have one really good episode, one not so good.</p>\n<p>Episode 6, ‚ÄúExtremis,‚Äù was really very good indeed. Right up there with the best of this series so far. And good to get the mystery of the vault revealed early on, rather than letting it drag on to the end of the season and be an anticlimax.</p>\n<p>Episode 7, ‚ÄúThe Pyramid at the End of the World,‚Äù despite the great title, was weaker, largely because of scientific irrationality and foolish plotting. To say nothing of incredibly lax biosecurity.</p>\n<p>That said, I did enjoy it while watching it. It‚Äôs one of those ones where a little bit more care, a few easily-insertable words, and it would all have held together much better. The problem with bad science or plotting based on foolish mistakes is that they can dump you out of the story.

Now they‚Äôre becoming alarmingly commonplace. I saw two outside Liverpool Street Station yesterday; armed, like the two above, not just with pistols, but with big, two handed things that most people would call ‚Äúmachine guns.‚Äù This increasing militarisation of the police was taken a step further this week when the Maybot ordered actual troops onto the streets. And I read that armoured vehicles were going to be deployed at the FA Cup final.</p>\n<p>Armed police on a beach: why? Was there a reasonable expectation of some sort of attack on <em>Scarborough beach</em>? And if there was: would weapons have helped? Armed police would not have stopped the tragedy in Manchester.</p>\n<p>The aim of the terrorist is to cause terror. All this escalation does is make ordinary people feel more worried, more scared. Worry and low-grade fear aren‚Äôt terror, but they‚Äôre on the same axis. Overreacting like this is playing into the terrorists‚Äô hands. As well, of course, as being a cynical political move in the runup to an election whose calling was, itself, a cynical political move.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn gave speech <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/25/jeremy-corbyn-links-foreign-policy-to-growing-terror-threat\">making reasonable, uncontentious points about</a> the links between foreign policy and terrorism.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I got an email from the BBC today, telling me that <a href=\"https://store.bbc.com/customer-info\">the BBC Store is closing</a> in November. Oddly, they don‚Äôt explain why. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/25/bbc-store-closing-november/\">This Engadget article</a> says it‚Äôs because ‚Äúpeople prefer streaming.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At least, that‚Äôs what the headline says. The article actually says the decision comes ‚Äúfollowing poor sales and tough competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Video.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Which is plausible enough, I suppose. Though I doubt that most people could explain the difference between a streaming service and one in which you have to download the file first. And in any case, Netflix and I think Amazon also allow you to download now.</p>\n<p>In fact my guess would be more that people prefer subscriptions. Amazon and Netflix are compelling because once your monthly fee is paid you can always watch anything they have. With the Store you had to buy specific titles, and there‚Äôs always that hesitation about paying before you watch something.</p>\n<p>I only ever used it to watch a couple of episodes of something I had left too late to see on iPlayer. specifically, one episode of <cite>Undercover</cite>. Apparently I spent ¬£1.89, and I‚Äôll be getting a ¬£2.50 Amazon voucher to make up for it. Whee, an investment.</p>\n<p>So I guess I was part of the poor sales.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there is the opinion of some ‚Äî and it would be of many in Britain, I imagine ‚Äî that BBC programmes should just be available. We shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for them again. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just listeners and viewers, it belongs to us,‚Äù as a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q2iZuU5WM\">great man once sang</a>.</p>\n<p>Maybe that‚Äôs the solution to the arguments over funding: treat the licence fee as a subscription charge. Increase it, make it optional, but include access to the BBC‚Äôs entire back catalogue.</p>\n<p>But the Engadget article goes on to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  If the rumours are true, BritBox ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/07/bbc-itv-britbox-streaming-service-launch/\">the BBC- and ITV-owned streaming service that launched in the US earlier this year</a> ‚Äî could be expanded to host more of the BBC‚Äôs back catalogue and eventually launch in the UK.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>BBC <em>and</em> ITV? Together? Well I never.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Back in Balloch in 1981, 82 or so we use to play a Pac-Man clone called Spout Rolla. But there are no references to it on the internet, as far as I can tell. So this is my story about it.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time a gang of kids ‚Äî thinking they were adults, but not really ‚Äî used to go to the pub, and play a game.</p>\n<p>The pub was actually the bar of a place called <a href=\"http://www.duckbay.co.uk\">Duck Bay Marina</a>. I see from that link that they now call it ‚ÄúDuck Bay Hotel.‚Äù Either way, it was a couple of miles outside Balloch, on the west bank of Loch Lomond.</p>\n<p>Why did we go there, when there were pubs in the town? Two reasons, I suspect. One, some of us had driving licences and the chance to use our parents‚Äô cars, so why not? (I wasn‚Äôt yet one of them at that point.) And two, it had video games in the foyer.</p>\n<p>That had a dual advantage. We could play the games, and those of us who, let‚Äôs say, weren‚Äôt quite strictly within the parameters of the legal drinking age, could stay out of sight of the staff.</p>\n<p>So: usually two machines, as I recall, plus maybe a fruit machine or two. I first played Frogger there. It was the era when arcade games had started to extend beyond shooting things in space to other tests of skill, like crossing rivers on logs.</p>\n<p>Spout Rolla was in a similar vein. But it was a clear derivative of ‚Äî let‚Äôs be honest, rip-off of ‚Äî Pac-Man. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd actually played Pac-Man at that point, but I must have been aware of it.</p>\n<p>The idea was you guided a paint brush moving around a watery maze, painting the maze behind it. Fish would come out and try to catch your brush. If you painted all the maze you got a new screen (which I think might just have been the same maze in different colours, maybe speeded up a bit).</p>\n<p>Instead of the power-pills of Pac-Man, there was one part of the maze that had a paint roller in it. If you approached the roller from the right direction, it went with you and you accelerated just for that section. Then you could turn back and roll over the fish that were following you, for extra points. And that was it.</p>\n<p>Simpler times, simpler pleasures, I guess. It never made much sense, but we liked it.</p>\n<p>Thing is, everything‚Äôs on the net today, right? Well, apparently not. When I googled it today, I found two surprising thing. First, that there are no references to ‚ÄúSpout Rolla game‚Äù to be found, with or without quotes round the first two words. Second, that <a href=\"https://mapcarta.com/17620080\">Spout Rolla is a place in Scotland</a>, namely a waterfall in Perth and Kinross.<sup id=\"fnref-3345-waterfall\"><a href=\"#fn-3345-waterfall\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Could this possibly be that most unlikely of things (at least before Rockstar Games): a Scottish game?</p>\n<p>My son suggested that there would be people my age trying to remember what the game was called. So I tried googling for a description of it: <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pac-man+clone+fish+paint+roller&amp;t=ipad&amp;ia=videos\">pac-man clone fish paint roller</a>. That search has selected videos, which I didn‚Äôt. But I did find a possible explanation.</p>\n<p>It seems there was a game called <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/arcade_crush\">Crush Roller, also known as Make Trax</a>, and the one I remember could be a rebadged version of that. Plus you can play it at that link. As with many games of the time, it‚Äôs not as satisfying playing them with arrow keys as it was with a joystick.</p>\n<p>So, no, it‚Äôs not Scottish, but it could possibly have been rebadged for the Scottish market. Or maybe just that one in Duck Bay, who knows.</p>\n<p>The only thing is that, seeing that version, I had forgotten about there being <em>two</em> rollers. I was fairly sure there was only one, but playing it felt familiar, so I guess Crush Roller/Make Trax is it.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-3345-waterfall\">\nInitially the only <a href=\"https://sv.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spout_Rolla\">Wikipedia page for it</a> I could find was in Swedish.

				"title": "Scattered Thoughts on the General Election",
				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"an-election-unlike-any-other\">An Election Unlike Any Other</h2>\n<p>This election is going to be completely unique in our lifetime, probably ever. Because people will be torn between voting on the normal things they care about: health, security, homes, welfare, the economy‚Ä¶ ‚Äî and the big thing of our time: Brexit.</p>\n<p>There were close to half the electorate who voted to stay in the EU (close to half the turnout, anyway). There‚Äôs no reason to suppose that any of those have changed their minds, even if many now talk in terms of acceptance. There are plenty who voted the other way who wish things had gone differently. And the non-voters are an unknown.</p>\n<p>If a party ‚Äî or a coalition ‚Äî were to clearly stand on a platform of stopping Brexit, or even of promising a second referendum, they would be in a position unlike any party ever. Or so it seems to me.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately only the Liberal Democrats seem to be even close to that position.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"i-cant-vote-labour\">I Can‚Äôt Vote Labour</h2>\n<p>I can‚Äôt in conscience vote for a Labour party that won‚Äôt clearly place itself against Brexit. I just can‚Äôt. This means I have to leave the party, I guess. Corbyn called today for ‚ÄúA Brexit that works for all.‚Äù No, no, no.</p>\n<p>I imagine this means I‚Äôll be voting Lib Dem. Possibly Green. I‚Äôm not sure where they stand yet. In one sense, of course, it doesn‚Äôt matter, as I live in one of the safest Labour seats, but that‚Äôs not really the point. I‚Äôll be writing to Diane Abbot to explain my position, but I don‚Äôt imagine it will change hers, which is to support Corbyn, even though her constituency is one of the most pro-remain in the country.</p>\n<p>I voted for Corbyn as leader twice, but he‚Äôs very disappointing now. Though I have to say that his policies on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->literally everything else<!-- raw HTML omitted --> would be dramatically better than the Tories.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-and-why-now\">Why, and Why Now?</h2>\n<p>Why has Mayhem changed her mind on a snap election, and why now? The obvious thing is the Tory lead in the polls, and to take advantage of Labour chaos. Nothing to with Brexit at all, not directly.</p>\n<p>But something I was seeing on Facebook tonight was the idea that they were about to lose their majority, when the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) brings charges for electoral fraud against up to 30 Tory MPs. The prosecutions will still happen, but they won‚Äôt affect the position of MPs who get elected this time round (well, unless they get convicted, of course, but I‚Äôm guessing the Tories will quietly deselect the ones who are likely to go down).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"effect-of-fixed-term-parliaments-act\">Effect of Fixed-Term Parliaments Act</h2>\n<p>My first reaction was, ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt: what about the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act?‚Äù Turns out that contains a clause that lets the sitting parliament ignore it, as long as they get a two-thirds majority. The irony of that figure was not lost on me, as possibly my most-retweeted tweet shows:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>‚Äî Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->April 18, 2017<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Without Labour voting with the government they wouldn‚Äôt get that two-thirds. Corbyn has cheerfully agreed to go along, missing an open goal. First, the opposition should oppose the government, as a general principle. Unless the government is doing the right thing, which is not the case here. More amusingly, if they didn‚Äôt get the two-thirds, they would have to go for a vote of no confidence. That is, a Tory MP would have to stand up in the House of Commons and move that ‚ÄúThis house has no confidence in Her Majesty‚Äôs Government.‚Äù Even if they could come back from that, Corbyn should have forced it just for the lulz.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"polls-cant-be-trusted\">Polls Can‚Äôt Be Trusted</h2>\n<p>All is doom and gloom, because the polls look so bleak.

				"content_text": "\n## An Election Unlike Any Other\n\nThis election is going to be completely unique in our lifetime, probably ever. Because people will be torn between voting on the normal things they care about: health, security, homes, welfare, the economy‚Ä¶ ‚Äî and the big thing of our time: Brexit.\n\nThere were close to half the electorate who voted to stay in the EU (close to half the turnout, anyway). There‚Äôs no reason to suppose that any of those have changed their minds, even if many now talk in terms of acceptance. There are plenty who voted the other way who wish things had gone differently. And the non-voters are an unknown.\n\nIf a party ‚Äî or a coalition ‚Äî were to clearly stand on a platform of stopping Brexit, or even of promising a second referendum, they would be in a position unlike any party ever. Or so it seems to me.\n\nUnfortunately only the Liberal Democrats seem to be even close to that position.</p>\n\n## I Can‚Äôt Vote Labour\n\nI can‚Äôt in conscience vote for a Labour party that won‚Äôt clearly place itself against Brexit. I just can‚Äôt. This means I have to leave the party, I guess. Corbyn called today for ‚ÄúA Brexit that works for all.‚Äù No, no, no.\n\nI imagine this means I‚Äôll be voting Lib Dem. Possibly Green. I‚Äôm not sure where they stand yet. In one sense, of course, it doesn‚Äôt matter, as I live in one of the safest Labour seats, but that‚Äôs not really the point. I‚Äôll be writing to Diane Abbot to explain my position, but I don‚Äôt imagine it will change hers, which is to support Corbyn, even though her constituency is one of the most pro-remain in the country.\n\nI voted for Corbyn as leader twice, but he‚Äôs very disappointing now. Though I have to say that his policies on <em>literally everything else</em> would be dramatically better than the Tories.</p>\n\n## Why, and Why Now?\n\nWhy has Mayhem changed her mind on a snap election, and why now? The obvious thing is the Tory lead in the polls, and to take advantage of Labour chaos. Nothing to with Brexit at all, not directly.\n\nBut something I was seeing on Facebook tonight was the idea that they were about to lose their majority, when the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) brings charges for electoral fraud against up to 30 Tory MPs. The prosecutions will still happen, but they won‚Äôt affect the position of MPs who get elected this time round (well, unless they get convicted, of course, but I‚Äôm guessing the Tories will quietly deselect the ones who are likely to go down).</p>\n\n## Effect of Fixed-Term Parliaments Act\n\nMy first reaction was, ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt: what about the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act?‚Äù Turns out that contains a clause that lets the sitting parliament ignore it, as long as they get a two-thirds majority. The irony of that figure was not lost on me, as possibly my most-retweeted tweet shows:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Snap general election called. Ironic that to ignore Fixed-Term Parliaments Act needs a two-thirds majority. Unlike, say, leaving the EU. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/fb?src=hash\">#fb</a>\n\n‚Äî Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/854281181864624129\">April 18, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nWithout Labour voting with the government they wouldn‚Äôt get that two-thirds. Corbyn has cheerfully agreed to go along, missing an open goal. First, the opposition should oppose the government, as a general principle. Unless the government is doing the right thing, which is not the case here. More amusingly, if they didn‚Äôt get the two-thirds, they would have to go for a vote of no confidence. That is, a Tory MP would have to stand up in the House of Commons and move that ‚ÄúThis house has no confidence in Her Majesty‚Äôs Government.‚Äù Even if they could come back from that, Corbyn should have forced it just for the lulz.</p>\n\n## Polls Can‚Äôt Be Trusted\n\nAll is doom and gloom, because the polls look so bleak. Except‚Ä¶ if there‚Äôs one thing the last few years have taught us, it‚Äôs that we can no longer rely on polls.[^bookies]\n\nOn <cite>Newsnight</cite> tonight <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mason_%28journalist%29\">Paul Mason</a> says he thinks Labour will win. Gotta admire his confidence, at least.\n\n[^bookies]: Or the bookies, and don‚Äôt get me back onto that argument about how bookies‚Äô odds can be mapped to percentages of expected voting.\n",

And at Easter, which still feels like the right time of the year.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/11/28/raven-and-what/\">as you‚Äôll know</a>, I thought last season was the best season of New Who. I may have been being a tad hyperbolic there‚Ä¶ but not entirely.</p>\n<p>And now we‚Äôve got ‚ÄúThe Pilot,‚Äù the first episode of the new season. Introducing <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4929530/\">Pearl Mackie</a> as Bill Potts. Among other things, I‚Äôve got to say that this would be a great jumping-on point; a fine episode for someone new to the series to start.</p>\n<p>The story was good, not great; there were unnecessary Daleks, but if that means they‚Äôre going to otherwise be given a rest for this season, I won‚Äôt complain; and we‚Äôve got the mysterious vault that The Doctor and Nardole are investigating. I suspect it might be most of the season before we find out what‚Äôs going on with that.</p>\n<p>Nice references to the past with the pictures of River and Susan; and the people who were fighting the Daleks were <a href=\"tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Dalek-Movellan_War\">Movellans</a>, apparently. I learned this on Jason Snell‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.theincomparable.com/teevee/doctorwho/\">Doctor Who Flashcast</a> podcast. I knew I recognised them, so I thought they must be <a href=\"http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Thal\">Thals</a>, and that we were right back at the start of it all. It‚Äôs a very long time since I saw either.</p>\n<p>So, The Doctor has been lecturing at Bristol University for maybe fifty years? Intriguing. And the mini-trailer that we got as well as the usual ‚ÄúNext time‚Ä¶‚Äù is even more so. Both Missy and John Simm (presumably as The Master). The start of The Doctor‚Äôs regeneration sequence. We know he‚Äôs going to regenerate, but not, presumably till the last episode.</p>\n<p>Though on that point, Capaldi said on <cite>The Graham Norton Show</cite> that he had already filmed his part of the regeneration scene, and the only thing they still had to film was the Christmas special. Not surprisingly he wouldn‚Äôt give an explanation of that paradox.</p>\n<p>I have a theory, or suggestion for how things might develop. They won‚Äôt do this, and they shouldn‚Äôt; but bear with me.</p>\n<p>In a reversal of the now-common trope of The Doctor‚Äôs companion falling for him, The Doctor falls for Bill. She, of course, is not interested. So The Doctor regenerates into a female form.</p>\n<p>That would be to put Bill‚Äôs sexuality too much to the fore, and of course be wildly unlike The Doctor. But it amused me to consider for a few minutes.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

That implies a path laid out for us, an unshakeable future that is planned and unchangeable. And it is entitled.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That is a perfectly normal use of the modern sense of the word ‚Äúentitled,‚Äù and it still slightly bothers me, as it has lo! these several years.</p>\n<p>Because what it really means is that the person isn‚Äôt actually entitled to the thing in question. The older sense of ‚Äúentitle‚Äù is to have the right to something ‚Äî literally to have the <em>title</em>.</p>\n<p>The modern meaning ‚Äî the ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so entitled‚Äù formulation ‚Äî really means ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs behaving as if he were entitled to‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/entitle\">Dictionary.com gives the definition of <em>entitle</em></a> as:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  to give (a person or thing) a title, right, or claim to something; furnish with grounds for laying claim\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Merriam-Webster is similar;</p>\n<blockquote>\n  1:  to give a title to :  designate<br>\n  2:  to furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming something this ticket entitles the bearer to free admission\n</blockquote>\n<p>And neither has the modern meaning at all.</p>\n<p>But I‚Äôm slightly horrified to find that the built-in dictionary in MacOS <em>only</em> has the modern meaning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  adjective<br>\n  believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment: kids who feel so entitled and think the world will revolve around them\n</blockquote>\n<p>It‚Äôs interesting, though, that its definition of <em>entitle</em> is similar to the two web-based ones. And <a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/entitled\">Cambridge</a> has <a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/entitle\">both</a>. It seems the difference is whether you use the verb or the adjective. The latter is the only one with the modern meaning.</p>\n<p>Language changes, and that‚Äôs fine. But I wish that people who use it in the modern fashion understood what it is they‚Äôre saying, and what it can sound like they‚Äôre saying.

Let‚Äôs go through them one by one.</p>\n<p>Warning: spoilers follow.</p>\n<h2>‚ÄúThe End of Hope Street,‚Äù by Malcolm Devlin</h2>\n<p>This is a strange story, set in the present day, about houses becoming ‚Äúunliveable.‚Äù This phenomenon is completely unexplained, but it is disastrous, and can even be fatal. And it accepted fatalistically by the large, and largely undifferentiated, cast of characters.</p>\n<h2>‚ÄúLiberty Bird,‚Äù by Jayne Fenn</h2>\n<p>The favoured son of a noble clan races the family yacht. In spaaaaaace. But he has a shameful secret that should be neither in highly advanced future society. On the other hand, a highly advanced future society shouldn‚Äôt have a nobility. I guess societies can go back as well as forward.</p>\n<h2>‚ÄúTaking Flight,‚Äù by Una McCormack</h2>\n<p>Another rich person mooches around with no real aim in life, this time in a society that has genetically engineered slaves.</p>\n<h2>‚ÄúPresence,‚Äù by Helen Oyeyemi</h2>\n<p>This is the most disjointed, disconnected of the stories. A heterosexual married couple avoid communicating with each other because she‚Äôs convinced he‚Äôs about to leave her. Until they do, and it turns out instead that he wants to postpone their holiday so they can try out some sort of therapy for grieving people that he has developed. They do, and things get strange. There‚Äôs potential here, but all the initial setup about them not communicating is just ignored after they get to the point, so it could have mostly been left out. It really feels like it wants to be two or more different stories.</p>\n<h2>‚ÄúThe Apologists,‚Äù by Tade Thompson</h2>\n<p>A super-advanced alien race have accidentally killed all by five people of the human race. The five are put to work helping the aliens reconstruct a simulacrum of Earth, while a daily apology is blasted at them out of a sound system (hence the title). They seem surprisingly untraumatised by this situation.</p>\n<h2>‚ÄúThe Arrival of Missives‚Äù (Extract), by Aliya Whiteley</h2>\n<p>Not sure why this is an extract. Probably the original work is too long to fit in the booklet. A during the First World War a sixteen-year-old girl is in love with her teacher. She decides she has to let him know. The extract ends just when something out of the ordinary is revealed.</p>\n<h2>Thoughts and Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Well, I haven‚Äôt made them sound very good, have I? I did actually enjoy reading them all, but reduced to capsule summaries, they aren‚Äôt going to win any awards. Oh, wait‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve no idea which one I‚Äôll vote for.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\nMy recent and forthcoming live music experiences all involve bands of my youth that have reformed and are touring their old material.[^mixture] Wallowing in nostalgia, some might call it.\n\nBut there‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with bands getting back together. It can be problematic if you are the band that tours as the Dead Kennedys, of course. There‚Äôs a whole saga there that I won‚Äôt go into, but if Jello Biafra‚Äôs not involved, and in fact is actively against it, then it‚Äôs not the Dead Kennedys.\n\nIndeed, in his song ‚ÄúBuy My Snake Oil‚Äù Jello suggested that a way for old punks to make money off their history would be to\n\n<blockquote><p>\n  Give in<br>\n  Ride the punk nostalgia wave<br>\n  For all it‚Äôs worth<br>\n  Recycle the name of my old band<br>\n  For a big reunion tour<br>\n  Sing all those hits from the ‚Äúgood ol‚Äô days‚Äù<br>\n  ‚ÄòBout how bad the good ol‚Äô days were\n</p></blockquote>\n\nWhich is a fair criticism of old bands doing their thing in modern days, I guess. But I see two arguments to counter it, from a gig-goer‚Äôs point of view.\n\n## Unfinished\n\nThe first was made by my friend <a href=\"http://www.writers-bloc.org.uk/comrades/andrew-j-wilson/\">Andrew</a>, around the time that the Sex Pistols reformed and toured. This would have been in 1996.\n\n‚ÄúI missed them first time round,‚Äù he said when I challenged him about it. ‚ÄúThis is unfinished business for me.‚Äù\n\nWhich was a good point, and kind of made me regret playing the purist and not going.\n\nIn 1993 I had investigated going to see the reunited Velvet Underground. But I really didn‚Äôt want to see them at an all-seated venue.  Partly because I‚Äôd had a bad experience seeing Lou Reed a year or so before (despite having had a very <em>good</em> experience with him a year or two before that).\n\nI recall that I phoned the venue ‚Äî Earl‚Äôs Court, I think ‚Äî and found that it did have some standing room. But those tickets were sold out. So I didn‚Äôt go. Regretted that, too. So I‚Äôm taking the chance to see bands like the Rezillos, or The Beat and The Selecter, that I missed first time around.\n\n## OK, But What is it Really?\n\nThe second point about the ‚Äúpunk nostalgia wave‚Äù (or any similar accusation of nostalgia) is: that is not what it is.\n\nBecause here‚Äôs the thing: it isn‚Äôt nostalgia if you‚Äôre carrying on with something that was always there.\n\n<blockquote><p>\n  Nostalgia (noun):  a feeling of pleasure and also slight sadness when you think about things that happened in the past\n</p></blockquote>\n<a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nostalgia\">according to Cambridge</a>.\n\nBut this isn‚Äôt that. Because while those bands‚Äô heydays might have been in the past, their music has remained available and frequently-played. You can‚Äôt be nostalgic for an album you listened to last week, or last night.\n\nAnd a live performance always happens in the present.\n\nThis train of thought was kicked off for me a couple of years back when there was an article in the <cite>Guardian</cite>, prior to <cite>The Force Awakens</cite> coming out. I can‚Äôt find it now,[^links] but it claimed that ‚Äúnostalgia‚Äù was part of the cause of the excitement for the new film.\n\nAnd I thought, no. Well, maybe for some people. But for many of us, if not most of us, <cite>Star Wars</cite> never went away. We‚Äôve watched it,  talked about it, read theories about it, and so on. It has been part of our lives.\n\nOr take <cite>Doctor Who</cite>. Sure, there were the wilderness years before 2005, but The Doctor never really went away. The Tardis and Daleks are burned into Britain‚Äôs cultural memory, and I think they always will be.\n\nNow if I were to see an episode of, say, <cite>Marine Boy</cite>: <em>that</em> would be nostalgic. I remember it fondly from my childhood, and have never seen it since. I‚Äôve never even seen it in colour, because those were the days of black &amp; white televisions.[^anothertime]\n\nBut I can‚Äôt be nostalgic for punk bands or <cite>Star Wars</cite> or <cite>Doctor Who</cite>, because they <em>never went away</em>. The sense of warmth and shared experience they bring: that‚Äôs not nostalgia, it‚Äôs something else. Familiarity, at worst. Or better: <em>community</em>.\n\n[^mixture]: Or a mixture of old and new, as with <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/28/rezillos-gig/\">The Rezillos</a>.\n\n[^links]: This is why you should always save links, folks.\n\n[^anothertime]: God, I really come from another time, don‚Äôt I?\n\n",

You can no longer argue that characters in popular TV programmes should not reflect the whole range of people in society. Nor can you make the argument that a character‚Äôs sexuality should have no place in <cite>Doctor Who</cite>, when it plainly has had a place at least since 2005.</p>\n<p>  Or don‚Äôt these people remember Rose being in love with The Doctor? Martha pining over him? Hell, go back further: Jo went off and married a male ecologist. And I‚Äôm sure at least a couple of other female companions went off with guys.</p>\n<p>  <strong>Flaunting</strong> their heterosexuality.</p>\n<p>  We won‚Äôt get any of that with Bill, at least.</p>\n<p>  Unless the next Doctor is a woman.\n</p></blockquote>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Borrowing that title from (what used to be) a regular section in Dave Langford‚Äôs <cite><a href=\"http://news.ansible.uk\">Ansible</a></cite> newsletter.</p>\n<p>The publishing sin in question, though, is quite astonishingly egregious, if the story is true. And I have no reason to doubt it.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs a book called <cite><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/too-like-the-lightning-ada-palmer/1122537906?ean=9780765378002\">Too Like the Lightning</a></cite>, by Ada Palmer. I read a review of it a year or so back and thought it sounded really interesting. But I didn‚Äôt get round to trying to get it at the time.</p>\n<p>Something reminded me of it recently, and I tracked it down, at least to the publisher‚Äôs site that I linked to there. But I wanted to buy a copy on Kindle, and Amazon had no sign of it. This is relatively rare nowadays. Especially in SF, surely.</p>\n<p>I tried again a couple of times, but to no avail. There are a few chapters available on the Tor website; and they were one of the first major publishers to really push ebooks without DRM, so you‚Äôd expect something there, but no.</p>\n<p>I think you can get a Nook copy at the site above, but Nook? I mean, come on.</p>\n<p>Anyway, eventually I duckducked in the modern style, which is to say I just typed the question: ‚Äúwhy is ‚Äòtoo like the lightning‚Äô not available on kindle‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I was led to a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5wwmo9/ada_palmer_ama_author_of_too_like_the_lightning/?st=j0pneb2r&amp;sh=d911c934\">Reddit AMA with the author</a>, wherein she said this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  That [making the book available on the UK Kindle store] can only happen if a UK publisher decides to publish it. Unfortunately <strong>UK publishers rarely publish female SF authors; a lot of them feel strongly that only male SF authors are likely to sell</strong>. If you want it to come out in the UK Kindle store, the best option is to write a quick e-mail to a couple of your favorite UK SP publishers to tell them you‚Äôre eager for these books ‚Äî hearing from readers makes a big difference when publishers are considering picking up an author for localization.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Emphasis mine. If this is true ‚Äî and again, I have no reason to doubt her word ‚Äî I am beyond horrified that such an attitude can be prevalent at UK publishers. In 2017.</p>\n<p>Obviously what I want to do now is to buy a physical copy, here in the UK. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Lightning-Terra-Ignota-Assistant-Professor-History-Palmer/0765378019/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490566148&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=too+like+the+lightning\">It‚Äôs listed on Amazon UK</a>, but it‚Äôs not clear whether it‚Äôs an import from the US, or what. (Also very strange is the author‚Äôs credit in that entry: ‚ÄúAssistant Professor of History Ada Palmer.‚Äù It even makes it into the URL.)</p>\n<p>As well as blatant sexism, this is an example of the ridiculous regionalism that publishers still try to force onto the internet age. Also film and TV companies. Luckily Apple stopped the music business doing that.</p>\n<p>Bits don‚Äôt see borders. And neither should we. But that‚Äôs very much another conversation.</p>\n<p>Actually, you know what I‚Äôm going to do? I‚Äôm going to see if I can order it from <a href=\"http://pagesofhackney.co.uk\">my local bookshop</a>. Support your local, as well as fight sexism in a small way.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

The UK takes the broader approach ‚Äî but for a different set of countries.</p>\n<p>The most interesting point to my mind is that this may all be Trump trying to help American businesses:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/us-unveils-new-restrictions-on-travelers-from-eight-muslim-majority-countries/2017/03/21/d4efd080-0dcb-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html?utm_term=.f8fd93ddc28d\">pressed by reporters</a>, officials in both countries said the measures were not a response to a specific threat, but rather the result of intelligence assessments¬†that concluded groups like the Islamic¬†State and al-Qaeda are seeking new methods to sow terror in the skies, possibly through hidden bombs in electronic equipment.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>And later:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Farrell and Newman suggested Tuesday‚Äôs order is an example of the Trump administration ‚Äúweaponizing interdependence‚Äù ‚Äî using its leverage in a world where American airports are key ‚Äúnodes‚Äù in¬†global air travel to weaken competitors. My colleague Max Bearak <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/21/what-is-the-logic-behind-trumps-new-electronics-ban-people-are-stumped/?utm_term=.41d88b6c74d5\">detailed how this could be a part of Trump‚Äôs wider protectionist agenda</a>. In February, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-08/u-s-airline-chiefs-set-to-talk-jobs-traffic-control-with-trump\">met with executives of U.S. airlines</a> and pledged that he would help them compete against foreign carriers that receive subsidies from their home governments.</p>\n<p>  ‚ÄúA lot of that competition is subsidized by governments, big league,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/21/what-is-the-logic-behind-trumps-new-electronics-ban-people-are-stumped/?utm_term=.41d88b6c74d5\">said</a> Trump at that meeting. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard that complaint from different people in this room. Probably about one hour after I got elected, I was inundated with calls from your industry and many other industries, because it‚Äôs a very unfair situation.‚Äù\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So unfair. But if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs behind it, what the hell does our glorious leader get out of going along with a slightly modified version of it? It‚Äôs certainly not to protect British airlines, as they (unlike American airlines) are affected by the ban. Maybe my ‚Äúlapdog‚Äù dig was exactly right. For years Tony Blair was referred too as George W Bush‚Äôs poodle. Maybe Theresa May is adopting the same role for Trump. Which is a horrifying thought.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/us-unveils-new-restrictions-on-travelers-from-eight-muslim-majority-countries/2017/03/21/d4efd080-0dcb-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html?utm_term=.0c6ec86f35ee&amp;wpisrc=nl_todayworld&amp;wpmm=1\">Another WaPo article</a> contradicts all that, though, suggesting that the whole thing might be based on some credible concerns:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  The U.S. restrictions were prompted by a growing concern within the government that terrorists who have long sought to develop hard-to-detect bombs hidden inside electronic devices may have put renewed effort into that work, according to people familiar with the matter\n</blockquote>\n<p>But it asks the question and fails to get a satisfactory answer, ‚ÄúWhy not ban all electronics on flights, then?‚Äù</p>\n<blockquote>\n  People familiar with the discussions said the restrictions were designed to defeat the particular type of threat that is of greatest concern: the possibility that terrorists could smuggle explosives inside electronics and manually detonate them once on a plane.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if that makes sense (after all, its not like a computer in the hold is (or could hide) some kind of timing device): why just from a strange subset of airports, even in the countries of concern?</p>\n<p>And if it‚Äôs all based on a real threat, why the US/UK difference?</p>\n<p>They also raise the real concern that journalists, activists, and just ordinary citizens, will be separated from their personal information, leaving it under the control of unknown people.</p>\n<p>Buckle up, folks, this ride is only going to get stranger and more unpleasant.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I‚Äôve just had two slightly odd experiences while researching Stiff Little Fingers.</p>\n<p>SLF were the first band I ever saw live, and they had a major effect on my life ‚Äî which is why I was researching them: I‚Äôm writing a longer piece about the effect they had on me.</p>\n<p>So as I was reading the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_Little_Fingers\">Wikipedia article</a> about them, I became somewhat confused. Because it says they split up in 1983, and reformed in 1987. Now the breakup I‚Äôd forgotten about, but it seems right. However, I saw them on the tour in 87. I saw them two days in a row. I had tickets for the Brixton Academy gig, which I think was on a Saturday, and then when <cite>Time Out</cite> came out that week there was a small advert in the back (I‚Äôve no idea how I came to see it), which said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <strong>Tin Soldiers</strong><br>\n  Belfast‚Äôs finest. Shhh: a secret gig!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Or something very like that. It was on the Friday night at the Mean Fiddler. Which I don‚Äôt think I had ever been to at that time, and which was a bastard long way from Tooting. But I wasn‚Äôt going to miss the chance to see SLF in a small club.</p>\n<p>What I mainly remember was that the Academy gig the next night was a bit of a letdown after the intensity of seeing them at the Mean Fiddler.</p>\n<p>But anyway, the point of all of this is that as far as I remember things, this all was ‚Äî or was billed as ‚Äî their farewell tour. That‚Äôs why the t-shirt (which I still have) says ‚ÄúGame Over.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Now obviously they‚Äôre around again, and I‚Äôve seen them since, and bought albums they‚Äôve released since. But my memory says they broke up in 87 (or it could have been 88, but I think not (though actually March 88 if <a href=\"http://www.setlist.fm/setlists/stiff-little-fingers-7bd6b20c.html?page=32\">this setlist site</a> is to be believed)), and then reformed later. But Wikipedia and <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/stiff-little-fingers-mn0000937098/biography\">All Music</a> both say I‚Äôm wrong.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt know. Who would <em>you</em> trust?</p>\n<p>Actually probably not me. I‚Äôm becoming more convinced as I look at that setlist site, that I must have seen them several times at the Academy, after moving to London in 87, and the supposed farewell tour must have been later. In which case the Mean Fiddler was a bastard long way from Walthamstow, but that‚Äôs still true.</p>\n<p>The second odd experience was that I clicked onto the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stiff_Little_Fingers\">Wikipedia talk page</a> to see whether the history was disputed at all. It isn‚Äôt, but around five sections in there‚Äôs a section entitled ‚Äúthe?‚Äù, in which someone asks whether they were ever referred to as ‚Äúthe Stiff Little Fingers.‚Äù</p>\n<p>And back in 2007 some guy called ‚Äú<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Devilgate\">Devilgate</a>‚Äù answered firmly in the negative.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

In fact, having written that, I just have: <a href=\"/categories/language\">language</a> (hopefully that link will work once I publish this).</p>\n<p>Today I want to talk about the word ‚Äúpivot.‚Äù As you know, pivot has come, over the last few years, to mean change direction, especially in a political context. A recent example from the <cite>New Yorker</cite>: <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dont-be-fooled-donald-trump-didnt-pivot\">Don‚Äôt Be Fooled. Donald Trump Didn‚Äôt Pivot</a>.</p>\n<p>It sort of makes sense, but like many knew usages, I can‚Äôt help but wonder <em>why</em> it has come into this use.</p>\n<p>And for this one I also can‚Äôt help but wonder to what extent <cite>Friends</cite> is responsible.</p>\n<p>You‚Äôll know the episode I‚Äôm thinking of, if you‚Äôve seen it: Ross is moving in to a new apartment, and being too cheap to pay the delivery charge, ropes Rachel in to help him move a sofa. Inevitably they get stuck on the stairs, and he keeps shouting at her, ‚ÄúPivot! Pivot!‚Äù to try to get her to turn the sofa in an unspecified direction.</p>\n<p>Of course, he might have been using it quite precisely: the sofa probably needed to rotate about a fixed point, which is what ‚Äúpivot‚Äù originally meant.</p>\n<p>What it has come to mean, in politics, is a change of direction less than a U-turn (or flip-flop); but still quite a substantial one. I suppose it has a sense of turning without moving forward at the same time. Though I may be overthinking it there. It‚Äôs quite descriptive, but it seems like it has becoming ubiquitous incredibly quickly; and is already practically a cliche.</p>\n<p>Of course that‚Äôs just my view of the <a href=\"/blog/2017/02/08/optics/\">optics</a> of the thing.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Though I notice the article is two years old. It just came to my attention via <strike>Facebook</strike> one of Twitter‚Äôs occasional emails.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  David Tredinnick said astrology, along with complementary medicine, could take pressure off NHS doctors, but acknowledged that any attempt to spend taxpayers‚Äô money on consulting the stars would cause ‚Äúa huge row‚Äù.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Getting his defence in early, he goes on to say that his likely critics (he names Brian Cox specifically):</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ are also ignorant, because they never study the subject and just say that it is all to do with what appears in the newspapers, which it is not, and they are deeply prejudiced, and racially prejudiced, which is troubling.‚Äù\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nice tactic: he knows he‚Äôs talking bullshit, so accuses people of racism. Last time I checked, astrology wasn‚Äôt a race.</p>\n<p>Nor was stupidity.</p>\n<p>And in the unlikely event that anyone reading this thinks I‚Äôm just being reflexively mean and as bad as the critics he fears, here‚Äôs a considered scientific opinion. The only possible known way the positions of the planets and stars at our birth could affect us is by gravity. And while gravity does travel all through the universe, it is very, very weak ‚Äî the weakest of the fundamental forces. Just look at how hard it was to measure gravitational waves. We were only able to do that in the last year, and it took colliding black holes to make enough of a splash for us to measure.</p>\n<p>Is it possible that heavenly bodies affect us in some other, as yet unknown way? Yes. And here‚Äôs what science says about that: show us how, and we‚Äôll study it. Demonstrate the mechanism by which this influence happens, and we‚Äôll write down the equations that govern it and learn all about it. We‚Äôll have to throw out all existing models of physics, but if you bring the evidence, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll do.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs science.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>More trouble with the home network today. We had a smart electricity meter installed a few days ago. Though without the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù part, because they couldn‚Äôt get a good enough signal down in our basement. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have considered that possibility in designing them, since that‚Äôs the kind of place where a lot of people‚Äôs meters are. Anyway, I think it was interfering with our powerline connection.</p>\n<p>We have a BT HomeHub as our main router and connection out to the fibre. But the wifi was a bit crap up at the top of house. So about a year back I got a couple of powerline connectors and used them to extend the 5GHz network upstairs, using another router that we had accidentally acquired as the other access point.</p>\n<p>It worked fine, until just the other day. The first symptom was that the Sonos app couldn‚Äôt connect to the speaker. I did some diagnosis, and everything was just weird. We could mostly connect to the outside world without any trouble, but I couldn‚Äôt connect to the HomeHub‚Äôs web interface by name. Nor, I think, by IP address. And then in one of my experiments I tried a slightly different IP address (one that shouldn‚Äôt have existed on our network), and I found myself at‚Ä¶ a Sky box.</p>\n<p>Now you know my dislike for that bunch. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd let their networking hardware on my LAN, any more than I‚Äôd subscribe to their channels. and in any case, just, what?</p>\n<p>I wondered if our network could somehow have got crossed with one of the neighbours‚Äô. But it seemed so improbable. The neighbouring network would need to be using the same <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-service-set-identifier-816547\">SSID</a>, at the very least.</p>\n<p>As you‚Äôd imagine, I started taking components out to try to isolate the problem. With just the BT HomeHub in place, things were back to normal. But as soon as I began adding parts, everything went weird.</p>\n<p>Eventually I concluded ‚Äî guessed, really ‚Äî that the smart meter might be using powerline itself. We‚Äôre supposed to get a screen-based device for monitoring usage, and maybe that communicates with the meter over powerline. And the meter could have an embedded sky router? That seems unlikely, but maybe Sky have the contract to do the phoning home for EDF.</p>\n<p>Anyway, since the root of the problem seemed to be at least partly to do with IP address conflicts, I decided to factory-reset everything and rebuild with a different IP address range (I‚Äôve never used <code>172.16.0.0</code> before). Along with a new wifi SSID and password.</p>\n<p>And so far so good. But I‚Äôm having trouble getting the second router to route properly via the first, so upstairs is going to be problematic till I can solve that.</p>\n<p>All this is doing, of course, is making me wish that we could get <a href=\"https://eero.com\">Eeros</a> in the UK. A self-configuring mesh network is exactly what we need, and not all this jerry-rigged nonsense.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

We do know that, should we ask and the other 27 member states agree, we could remain. But it is brave to assume that two years of exposure to the negotiating skills of Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and David Davis will not generate even one hold-out. [...] The preponderance of legal opinion is that we could, after all, decide to remain. That we could, having notified, withdraw that notification. But, given the magnitude of the issue, our parliament must know more than what the answer probably is. It must know what it actually is.<br>\n  [...]<br>\n  only the court to which we all subscribe can give an answer: the European Court in Luxembourg.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>He/she (I‚Äôm guessing ‚Äúhe,‚Äù from the writing style) says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  But a case which‚Äîalong with Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley, Steven Agnew, a Green member of the Northern Irish Assembly and Keith Taylor, a Green MEP‚ÄîI am bringing in the Dublin High Court seeks to give us the power to travel back if we need it.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>And he explains that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  We access it via a national court. And it can‚Äôt be one of ours. One of the complaints in the Dublin case is that the other 27 have breached the Treaty by excluding us from Council meetings before we‚Äôve notified under Article 50. And that complaint can only be made by a court in one of those 27. The Irish court is the natural choice\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which all seems fair. The idea seems to be that the European Court of Justice could rule definitively that we could revoke our triggering of Article 50 at the end of the two-year negotiating period. And if the deal is bad, or especially if there isn‚Äôt one, parliament is likely to call another referendum in those circumstances, wherein we‚Äôll know exactly what we‚Äôre voting for, and get it right this time.</p>\n<p>A small hope, like I say. And it doesn‚Äôt protect us from the damage that‚Äôs being inflicted in the meantime.</p>\n<p>But a small hope is better than none at all.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I‚Äôm far from alone in that attitude, of course. But this means, most notably, that I would never get Sky TV. That has only ever mildly bothered me on the odd occasion when they‚Äôre showing a film I‚Äôd like to see that isn‚Äôt available elsewhere.</p>\n<p>But things have taken a turn for the worse lately, and it‚Äôs largely the fault of an American TV company that I generally heartily approve of: HBO.</p>\n<p>Actually the rot probably started to set in when Sky got the rights for <cite>Mad Men</cite> Season 5, after the first four had been on BBC 2. I‚Äôve still never got round to seeing the later seasons.</p>\n<p>But the problem with HBO shows is that Sky has the exclusive UK right for something like five years. And that means I haven‚Äôt been able to see <cite>Westworld</cite>. Which is a shame, because everyone was talking about it a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>More worryingly by a long way for me, though, is that the new series of <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, which is not being made by HBO, but something called Showtime. It‚Äôs due out in May, I believe, and guess who has the UK rights?</p>\n<p>Showtime seem to have a streaming service, so maybe that‚Äôll work here. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it didn‚Äôt, though.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, in doing some research when writing this, I discovered that <cite>Westworld</cite> is available to download via iTunes, so maybe the same will be true for <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>.</p>\n<p>Either way, it‚Äôs going to cost.

But yes, you read that right: I interrupted reading a Banksie. Now even though it‚Äôs a reread, that‚Äôs not something that happens normally.</p>\n<p>But then this is not a normal Banksie. My memory of it was that although I hadn‚Äôt loved it, it was good enough. But all I remembered from it was two scenes, and the overall background.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve got to say now, I‚Äôm afraid, that it‚Äôs down there with <cite>Canal Dreams</cite> as my least favourite. In fact when I reread <cite>Canal Dreams</cite> at some point in the past, I found it was better than I had remembered. This, though: this was worse than I remembered.</p>\n<p>I mean, it‚Äôs not <em>terrible</em>. If it were written by someone else, it would probably be fine. But no more than that, I‚Äôd imagine: no more than <em>fine</em>.</p>\n<p>What‚Äôs wrong with it? Well, it‚Äôs just not compelling in the way I expect Banks‚Äôs books to be. There are no  characters to speak of, except for the narrator, who is not especially endearing. That shouldn‚Äôt matter, but he‚Äôs not particularly anything else, either. His attitude to the war-torn environment in which he finds himself is essentially that it is inconveniencing him (and, to be fair, depriving him of his ancestral home).</p>\n<p>But the guy owns a castle. I mean, how sympathetic is he going to be?</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt know, I think the main problem is just that it‚Äôs so bloody <em>bleak</em>. I was convinced that it must have been written while he was getting divorced, or otherwise going through a dark period in his life, but <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Banks\">the Wikipedia article</a> doesn‚Äôt suggest anything of the sort.</p>\n<p>Anyway, there we go. Another reread. But not one that I can imagine coming back to again. And there are plenty others still to come.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I decided it was time to ask my MP, Diane Abbott, to do the right thing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Dear Ms Abbott,</p>\n<p>Now that the Supreme Court has made its decision, affirming parliament‚Äôs sovereignty, I strongly urge you to vote against triggering Article 50.</p>\n<p>The most urgent issue facing our country at the moment is Brexit, and the only solution to Brexit is to stop it happening. As a Labour Party member, and one who voted for Jeremy Corbyn as leader twice, I‚Äôm very disappointed by the recent reports that he is planning to require MPs to vote in favour of triggering Article 50.</p>\n<p>I know it would be unpopular with certain tabloid papers if parliament were to prevent Brexit. But in truth I think it would be popular in the country. It seems highly likely to me that if there were a second referendum now, the majority would vote in favour of staying in the EU.</p>\n<p>That may be wishful thinking, but I don‚Äôt believe so: people have both realised they were lied to, and seen something of what Brexit will mean to the economy, to jobs, and to British society.</p>\n<p>And in any case, parliament is sovereign, and the majority in the referendum was far too small to justify what is, in effect, a constitutional change. Surely an MP‚Äôs duty is to vote in the way that is best for the country, and it is clear that leaving the EU would not be in the UK‚Äôs best interests.</p>\n<p>I urge you to resist the tyranny of the right-wing press, and go with the majority of Hackney North and Stoke Newington voters, and please: vote against triggering Article 50.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>Martin McCallion</p></blockquote>\n<p>That ought to do it, eh?</p>\n</body></html>\n",

He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president.<br>\n  ‚Ä¶<br>\n  He has poisoned our water forever. Nixon will be remembered as a classic case of a smart man shitting in his own nest. But he also shit in our nests, and that was the crime that history will burn on his memory like a brand. By disgracing and degrading the Presidency of the United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>They were a crooked bunch, though, the Republicans back then. This on Spiro Agnew:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  He was a flat-out, knee-crawling thug with the morals of a weasel on speed. But he was Nixon‚Äôs vice president for five years, and he only resigned when he was caught red-handed taking cash bribes across his desk in the White House.\n</p></blockquote>\n\nWhich is not exactly accurate according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon\">Wikipedia article</a>, but it‚Äôs not too far off.\n\nThe quote Gruber draws our attention to is this:\n<blockquote>\n  Some people will say that words like scum and rotten are wrong for Objective Journalism ‚Äî which is true, but they miss the point. It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place. He looked so good on paper that you could almost vote for him sight unseen. He seemed so all-American, so much like Horatio Alger, that he was able to slip through the cracks of Objective Journalism. You had to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly, and the shock of recognition was often painful.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhich reminds me of something I‚Äôve been thinking about for a long time. Which is that I don‚Äôt think I <em>want</em> journalism to be objective. At least not in the area of political commentary. News is different, of course. But to me the best journalistic writing comes about when the writer‚Äôs personality comes through. When their unique voice can be heard in every paragraph.

As well as the many integrations and efficient handling of archiving and deleting emails, I like it because it is one of the only apps that lets you order mail in the One True Way.</p>\n<p>Which in case you‚Äôre wondering is oldest at the top. Newest at the top is fine for blogs and similar news-based things, but it‚Äôs not right for anything else. Call me old-fashioned, but that was the default in Eudora and probably in Mutt and Elm and all those too, and it was and remains the best way.</p>\n<p>Even Outlook lets you order it oldest-first. Though disturbingly few people take advantage of it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that‚Äôs not the point. The point is that today Dispatch let me down. I was typing a reply on my iPad this morning. The reply composition window looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_5a7.jpeg\" alt=\"Fullsizeoutput 5a7\" title=\"fullsizeoutput_5a7.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:20px\"></p>\n<p>I did <em>something</em> ‚Äî I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äî that made the composition window slide off to the right. Part of it was still visible, so I tried tapping on it. And it disappeared.</p>\n<p>There was no prompt, and nothing in my drafts folder. All that I had typed was gone, like tears in rain.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve just been trying to reproduce it, and I can, up to a point: if you slide the compose window to the right it goes off out of the way, like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_5ab.jpeg\" alt=\"Fullsizeoutput 5ab\" title=\"fullsizeoutput_5ab.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:20px\"></p>\n<p>Which is actually quite useful, because it makes the compose window non-modal and lets you interact with your other messages. But somehow something can go wrong, even though I can‚Äôt make it happen now.</p>\n<p>Not the end of the world. I retyped the mail. But that‚Äôs not good enough, Dispatch.

I‚Äôm not sure about the title, but it‚Äôs a good piece, by Paul Mason (in fact, looking at the URL I suspect that wasn‚Äôt the original title).</p>\n<p>He starts by talking about <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com\">SoundCloud</a>, which is, for me at least, one of those sites that you would never think of going to; you just follow a link to something on it. Mind you, increasingly many sites are like that, and have been since perhaps the early days of blogging. Anyway, Mason says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The Berlin-based music service started as a super-cool platform for people who made music and wanted to share it. Last week, its owners admitted it was losing a million dollars a week, and could run out of cash before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>  ‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>  The whole future of the little orange cloud now rests on whether it can get people to subscribe ‚Äì for money.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which is interesting, and it‚Äôs one of those things that the net is a better place for it existing, and I‚Äôd be sad to see go away ‚Äî but I can‚Äôt imagine ever subscribing to it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In the same week, another achingly cool online publisher, this time of blogs, Medium, also hit trouble.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúAchingly cool‚Äù? Medium? I‚Äôm not convinced (disclaimer: for what it‚Äôs worth, my posts are automatically crossposted to Medium, among other places).</p>\n<p>He goes on to talk about how none of the social media sites is profitable, except of course for Facebook. He refers to</p>\n<blockquote>\n  the ailing internet platforms ‚Äì not just Soundcloud and Medium but Ello, a wannabe rival to Facebook, and Tumblr\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tumblr is ailing? that seems surprising, considering how popular it is. But who knows (it‚Äôs also one of the other places I mentioned above). He goes on to exhort us to return to these sites, dust off our old user IDs and so on, and enjoy them again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  It will feel a bit like time travel ‚Äì back to the period around 2010-12, when social media was associated with postmodernity, self-produced music and revolt, not fake news, white supremacy and rule by old men. But usage alone will not save the collaborative tools. We need new, cooperative ownership models. If basic word processors are effectively now shipped free with every device, so too could be a nonprofit music-sharing service, a free blogging platform and a place to keep in contact with our friends, without intrusive data-farming and a deluge of ads.\n</blockquote>\n<p>As to that, a free blogging platform ‚Äî while not ‚Äúshipped‚Äù, is easily available: <a href=\"https://wordpress.com\">Wordpress</a>. And there are others, of course. But it links back to what I was <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/07/independent-microblogging/\">saying the other day</a>: you‚Äôve got to own your own content if you want it to be safe from services disappearing.</p>\n<p>As to that ‚Äúrailways‚Äù reference in the title, here‚Äôs how he finishes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  Medium, Soundcloud and ultimately Twitter are ‚Äì like the railways ‚Äì worth saving even if they cannot be run at a profit. 2017 can and should be a year in which the users of platforms reclaim these freedoms not as privileges but as rights.\n</blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôve got a lot of time for that view, actually, but those sites are mostly set up on a capitalist model (even if they have a community spirit), and I can‚Äôt see that changing any time soon.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I mean, <code>uname</code> shows me the kernel version and all that, but not the distro.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all that doesn‚Äôt really matter. I was only doing it to install <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node</a>, and I was only wanting to install Node so that I could run <a href=\"https://github.com/stephen/airsonos\">AirSonos</a>. We got a <a href=\"http://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/play1.html\">Sonos Play:1</a> for the kitchen recently, and it‚Äôs great, but the one weakness is that it doesn‚Äôt support playing from an arbitrary source one your phone, such as, say, your podcast app of choice (<a href=\"https://overcast.fm\">Overcast</a>, obvs).</p>\n<p>AirSonos is supposed to effectively turn the Sonos into an AirPlay speaker, so you can easily send audio to it from iOS devices. And you want it to be running on a server, so it‚Äôs available all the time.</p>\n<p>But it turns out that Node does not want to install on my NAS. Either by <code>apt-get</code>, as above, or by downloading the binary and unpacking it. (That installs it, obviously, but it won‚Äôt run.)</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm going to try running <a href=\"http://sonoair.mihosoft.eu\">SonoAir</a> on my MacBook. That‚Äôs a wrapper round AirSonos, and obviously it‚Äôll only work (assuming it does at all) when my MacBook is awake. But life‚Äôs too short.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It consists of a series of extracts from government and newspaper reports, and comments by someone who signs themselves ‚ÄúThe Archivist.‚Äù These are further annotated by the FBI agent.</p>\n<p>The subject matter is mysteries: the many UFO reports, going back to Roswell and before; the mysterious goings on around Twin Peaks itself; stories of the Illuminati and the masons, and so on. Some of the quoted reports are, I assume, real. Many are part of the <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> universe.

So I should bring things up to date.</p>\n<p>I had a few interviews, but no serious interest. Then July was ending, and I was beginning to think that soon we‚Äôd be going on holiday, and once we got back it would be nearly September. That was longer than I fancied going without having something lined up.</p>\n<p>And then I got a call from a recruiter telling me there was a bank in the City looking for someone with my exact skill set for a six-month contract. It was supporting ‚Äî and to some extent building on ‚Äî the products that I used to make at Misys. That wasn‚Äôt quite what I had seen myself doing. I was looking for something that was more of a change, more of a challenge.</p>\n<p>But I went in to talk to them and it all sounded pretty good. A significant number of the people who work there are ex-Misys, and I know them, so it would make for a relatively smooth transition.</p>\n<p>But a contract. I hadn‚Äôt really intended to go down that route. Still, the idea of being a freelancer appealed. I‚Äôd like to have a go at indie development one of these days, and the two can be complementary. We‚Äôll see where that goes. But I decided to go for it. Set up the limited company (more on that in a later post), discussed the contract (including while I was on holiday) and started at the end of August.</p>\n<p>And it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ OK. The people are good, the location is great. But the work is not that interesting, and the internal politics are‚Ä¶ interesting.</p>\n<p>And there‚Äôs the pressure of knowing that you‚Äôre dealing (sometimes) with a live system. With real people‚Äôs actual money. Having only worked for a software company before, that feels unexpectedly high-pressure.</p>\n<p>All things considered, when my contract is up for renewal at the end of February, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be renewing it (even assuming they offer it to me, which they probably will). So I‚Äôll be looking for another position shortly. Maybe contract, maybe permanent again. It depends what comes up.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I thought it was now long gone, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BookshopGlasgow\">apparently not</a>. I was there, probably with my Mum ‚Äî no, undoubtedly, as I didn‚Äôt go to Glasgow on my own till I was about sixteen ‚Äî I‚Äôm guessing in about January, to spend Christmas money (often given in the form of <a href=\"http://www.nationalbooktokens.com\">Book Tokens</a> in those days, of course).</p>\n<p>I bought a stack of books. I don‚Äôt now recall what any of them were, but they were almost certainly mostly or entirely SF.</p>\n<p>As was the freebie that I got by accident. If memory serves I paid at the checkout and gathered up my books, or more likely the assistant put them in a bag for me, and then when I got on to the train back to Balloch, I took them out to have a look.</p>\n<p>And found I had more than I‚Äôd bargained for. Worse, more than I‚Äôd paid for. There was an extra book in my bag. One that I had never seen before, that I hadn‚Äôt chosen. One with an interesting title.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?1763\"><cite>Again, Dangerous Visions, Book 2</cite></a>, edited by Harlan Ellison.</p>\n<p>My immediate feeling was guilt. I had, effectively, stolen a book. I was a good Catholic boy, and would never have stolen anything.</p>\n<p>Then surprise: how had it got there? Presumably the assistant had mixed it up with the purchases of the person before me. There was probably someone sitting on a train right at that moment, realising that one of their books was missing. Poor them.</p>\n<p>Poor them, but lucky me. I don‚Äôt think I told my Mum it had happened. Or if I did, she must have said not to worry, it was too late to do anything; and that doesn‚Äôt sound like her. One way or another, we made no attempt to return it.</p>\n<p>But I think among the confusion and excitement of it all, I must have been slightly annoyed that it was the second volume: not much use without that first. And that ‚ÄúAgain‚Äù: did that mean that the whole thing was some kind of follow-on?</p>\n<p>Obviously I know now that it did. When I went to university a few years later and met a community of fans, when they mentioned the famous <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Visions\"><cite>Dangerous Visions</cite></a> (non-) trilogy, I had some idea of what they were talking about.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd like to say that it was some kind of formative experience. That reading those legendary short stories changed my approach to the genre, or my understanding of fiction, or what have you. But I can‚Äôt really say that it did.</p>\n<p>I eventually read the stories. Not having the earlier volumes of an anthology doesn‚Äôt cause any problem. Though I think I took the original, <cite>Dangerous Visions</cite> out of the library. Some of them were great, but I don‚Äôt recall finding any of them particularly memorable (though you never know: some things burrow deep). But one of the titles stuck with me, and is why I started writing this today.</p>\n<p>That was ‚ÄúA Mouse in the Walls of the Global Village,‚Äù by Dean Koontz. Though I couldn‚Äôt have told you who it was by, and I‚Äôm quite surprised to find that it‚Äôs Koontz, who I think of as a horror author.</p>\n<p>It came to mind because of something my beloved was saying about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/26/george-osborne-yuval-noah-harari-conversation?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">this interview between George Osborne and Yuval Noah Harari</a>. She mentioned the ‚Äúglobal village‚Äù idea, and my mind jumped back to the story and the cascade of memories that go with that book. I downloaded the Kindle version of the book (and the first one) and started writing this.</p>\n<p>As I recall, that global village involved telepathy, and is very much not the one we are living in. But that doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs time to reacquaint myself with some old New Wave SF.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

That is, not every bookshop put it in the right section. After all, what is the right section? History? Sociology? Politics?</p>\n<p>Really, the right section is probably ‚ÄúJournalism,‚Äù but most bookshops don‚Äôt (or didn‚Äôt) have such a section.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it turns out that <cite>Screwjack</cite> wasn‚Äôt journalism, but fiction, and in any case was a limited-edition release of only a few hundred or so, and when the web and eBay came along, copies used to go for hundreds of pounds or dollars.</p>\n<p>Sometime after he died it got a proper release, and I finally got round to buying it. It‚Äôs a slim, small-format hardback, containing three stories. And I‚Äôve got to say that just a few weeks after reading them, they‚Äôre almost totally unmemorable.

It was published in 1994 and consists of interviews with a selection of the women who were relatively newly on the scene, or were established but getting some more visibility, around that time. It was the time of Riot Grrrl, among other movements.</p>\n<p>So among the interviewees are Courtney Love, Huggy Bear, Liz Phair, Tanya Donnelly, Kristin Hersh, Kim Gordon‚Ä¶ even Bjork. But there‚Äôs someone missing from the book. Nearly all of the interviewees, when talking about their influences or other women who were doing something interesting at the time, mention PJ Harvey. And she is not interviewed. Which is a shame. I would have loved to have read her thoughts on making music back then (or now, for that matter). And I‚Äôm sure Amy Raphael would have loved to interview her, so I‚Äôm guessing she didn‚Äôt want to do it.</p>\n<p>But aside from that, it‚Äôs an interesting work. Very much a document of its time, though no doubt the problems and challenges that these women faced have not changed that much. A similar book today, though, would have a very different complement of interviewees; and indeed would need a different subtitle: women musicians are much more prominent in pop and R&amp;B today, from Beyonc√© on down. But maybe not so much in rock, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>Well worth a read, though.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"title": "Some Thoughts On Software Development",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Before the job interview that I <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/19/2461/\">mentioned the other day</a>, the company asked me to answer some questions in writing. I didn‚Äôt get the job, but I was pleased with my written answers (and they presumably helped me to get the interview, at least). So I thought I‚Äôd reuse them as a blog post. None of this should be surprising for anyone who knows anything about the software development field, but it‚Äôs interesting to reflect on how things have changed across my career.</p>\n<h3>What are some of the fundamental changes in your approach to software development you have adopted in the last few years?</h3>\n<p>There are two main changes that are fundamental and independent of languages and deployment environments: agile techniques and test-driven development (TDD).</p>\n<h4>Agile</h4>\n<p>Moving from waterfall to agile development was probably the most significant change to development practices in the industry. We always knew that breaking work down into smaller units led to better estimating, more modular code, and just better software. The genius of agile was to extend that understanding to the period of time spent on a block of work. A two-week sprint, with its work being specifically estimated, planned and developed, is just infinitely more manageable than a project phase lasting months.</p>\n<p>Add to that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>self-organising teams which include someone from the customer or end user ‚Äî or at least someone whose role is to represent the user;</li>\n<li>accepting that change will happen, and embracing it;</li>\n<li>and the discipline of saying that some features <em>won‚Äôt</em> be developed;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and we have a recipe for success.</p>\n<h4>TDD</h4>\n<p>Good developers always understood that testing was essential, and did it. But they used to follow a written test plan, or just have an idea of what needed to be tested and work to that. Testing was manual, hard to repeat, and error-prone.</p>\n<p>TDD brought automation. So instead of writing a document listing the required tests, we can write code. That inherently makes the tests rerunnable, so regressions get caught before they become a problem.</p>\n<p>But almost more important than that is the idea of writing the tests first. In an ideal world you write a comprehensive set of tests, write functional code until all the tests pass, and you‚Äôre done. It may not always work out exactly like that ‚Äî in particular, adding tests to a mature codebase can be problematic ‚Äî but writing tests first encourages us to write code that is easy to test, which tends to lead to better-designed, more modular code.</p>\n<p>An added bonus is that the tests can help to document the code, by showing our expectations. And of course they make refactoring easy and safe, as long as they are in place before you start.</p>\n<h3>If you were to start your last project over again, what would you do differently?</h3>\n<p>The project I‚Äôm thinking of involved rewriting the product‚Äôs GUI into a modern, responsive, browser-independent form, using HTML 5 and Twitter Bootstrap.</p>\n<p>The existing version was an old frames-based web app that only worked fully in Internet Explorer, and had to be tweaked when each new version of that browser came out. We had long wanted to modernise it, but there were always other demands on development time.</p>\n<p>Eventually I got a chance to try a proof of concept for the change. The application uses JSPs and Struts action classes, and the brief was to continue using these as much as possible. I decided to start with one of the main display pages, the one that users spend most of their time in. The idea was to give a quick demonstration of what was possible; and it did, to a point. But what I hadn‚Äôt realised was that frames are not part of HTML 5. There are ways to keep using them, but it‚Äôs not easy, and not good practice.</p>\n<p>So while the new look and feel of a single page was clear, it was far from clear how the various pages would interact, how they would be brought together to form the whole UI,  without frames.</p>\n<p>If I were to start the project again now, my first step would be to work out how to link the pages together into a single interface, in the absence of frames. Most likely I would use one or other of the forms of JSP includes.</p>\n<p>However, if there was the budget to do a more complete rewrite ‚Äî by which I mean one that did not necessarily seek to use the existing JSPs ‚Äî I would probably make much greater use of JavaScript and Ajax, and use the action classes just to provide data to the Ajax calls.</p>\n<h3>What is your approach to testing, and how would you test your application?</h3>\n<p>I would use a mixture of automated unit testing using JUnit, automated GUI testing, and actual user testing, if at all possible.</p>\n<p>This fits well with what I was saying above. There are, broadly, three levels of testing: unit, integration, and system. Though writing automated unit tests is a development activity, rather than a testing one. Certainly we wouldn‚Äôt expect dedicated QA testers to work at the unit-test level.</p>\n<p>So let‚Äôs assume that we have satisfactory unit-test coverage and we are interested in testing the application as a whole. Automation is obviously key here, as well, both because it allows us to easily repeat the tests regularly ‚Äî for every checkin, in an ideal world (and see below); and because it removes the need for testers to manually step through a written script, which is boring and error-prone.</p>\n<p>I have used Selenium for automated GUI testing, with some success. It takes a significant amount of development work, because it‚Äôs doing a significant thing, but the effort should pay off.</p>\n<p>However, even after all that, there is still no alternative to having someone sit down and actually <em>use</em> the application. Automated testing might pick up outright errors in how the user interaction works. But it won‚Äôt catch fine details like misaligned elements, typos in onscreen text, or just generally how it feels to use the application.</p>\n<h3>What are the benefits of Continuous Integration?</h3>\n<p>Continuous Integration takes us beyond the traditional daily build. It does more than just building, and does it more frequently than just daily.</p>\n<p>At the simplest level it ensures that, for every commit, an incremental build of the complete product is made, and all the unit tests are run. In the most advanced case, as well as building and testing, the product can be deployed to test servers and integration tests such as the automated GUI tests mentioned above can be run. Realistically those tend to take longer, so it‚Äôs unlikely that you would do them for <em>every</em> commit, but they can certainly be run multiple times daily.</p>\n<p>So we get the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>frequent builds catch problems in code integration;</li>\n<li>unit tests are run frequently, catching any regressions;</li>\n<li>integration tests are run regularly, catching other problems;</li>\n<li>general confidence in the product is increased;</li>\n<li>developers are happy to commit changes frequently.</li>\n</ul>\n</body></html>\n",

The people who feel entitled to call the party their own have competing viewpoints; some of them want to see a leftward shift and others range from wanting Miliband 2.0 to the rebirth of Blairism.<br>\n‚Ä¶<br>\nThe idea too often seems to be ‚ÄúVote for Labour because we aren‚Äôt the Tories‚Äù.<br>\n‚Ä¶<br>\nInstead of slinging insults at opponents or branding them all Blairites, Corbyn supporters would do better to focus on the task at hand ‚Äì winning a future general election.<br>\n<footer> ‚Äî<cite><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/22/corbyn-labour-crisis-politics-tribalism-winning-elections\">When will Labour‚Äôs tribal warfare come to an end?</a></cite></footer>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That idea of the divisions on the left go further than just the Labour party. I thought it was well summed up by this banner that I saw on the Palestine Solidarity march two years ago:\n\n<img style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px\" title=\"Banner on march\" src=\"https://devilgate.org/uploads/2023/img-2826.jpg\" alt=\"March with banner showing 'CPGB-ML Communist Pary of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist)'\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" border=\"2\">\n\n‚ÄúCommunist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist),‚Äù it says. You can just feel the layers of splits down the years that have led it to such an unwieldy name. Splits on the left are far from new. It‚Äôs an old criticism that we spend more time fighting among ourselves than fighting the real enemies.\n\nOr in this case, than working out how to get back into power. Because going back to Lincoln[^abe] and his compromises, to Hillary and her desire to get things done: it‚Äôs all for nothing if we don‚Äôt get a Labour government into power.\n\nThe problem is that Corbyn is ‚Äúunelectable.‚Äù Is he? I‚Äôm not sure we know that. He‚Äôs sometimes compared to Michael Foot, who famously failed to win an election. But things are very different today from how they were in the eighties. It won‚Äôt be easy, but a Labour Party that got fully behind a left-wing leader might well be in a position to win power in 2020, when the next election is due. Or sooner, if May goes to the country over Brexit or otherwise.\n\nIn the end I wonder if Corbyn‚Äôs biggest problem isn‚Äôt just handling the Media. Maybe he needs an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell\">Alistair Campbell</a> figure (or hell, why not: a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Tucker\">Malcolm Tucker</a> one). Does he even <em>have</em> a press secretary or Director of Communications?\n\nAll of this leaves me not knowing how to vote in the new leadership election. My heart is with Corbyn, as most of his policies <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/09/09/leadership/\">match my own principles</a>. But if the MPs won‚Äôt get behind him again, then we‚Äôll be right back where we are now, with the party not providing a useful opposition, and with no likelihood of electoral success.[^split]\n\nOwen Smith, on the other hand, seems more likely to fight for us to remain in the EU. But can we trust him?\n\nAnd either way, what will it do to the party as a whole? A party divided against itself, or worse, a party split in two, has no chance of forming a government.</p>\n</body></html>\n\n\n[^spielberg]: Though I wonder whether anyone with less Hollywood power than Spielberg could have got a film made that was so much about talking and legal and political manoeuvring.\n\n[^abe]: No left-winger, of course, though seeing the Republican Party today, it‚Äôs impossible to understand how he could have been one of its founders.\n\n[^split]: Because, I contend, of the split, rather then necessarily the leadership.\n",

But let‚Äôs leave that aside for now.\n\n\n\n[^fn2]: Though let‚Äôs face it, we mostly do. If there was a god, and it didn‚Äôt want us to listen to loud music, then why would it have invented amplification?\n",

I put the old memory back just to check that I hadn&rsquo;t damaged  something, and it started up like before.</p>\n<p>So it looked like OWC were wrong, and I was restricted to 8GB. I was considering sending the memory back to Crucial and hoping I could get I refund. But then I tried one more thing. One of the new 8GB sticks along with one of the old 2GB ones.</p>\n<p>And it booted up, smooth as a cliche.</p>\n<p>Of course I tried swapping out one 8GB stick for the other, to check for the possibility that one of them actually was bad. But both of them worked. So it seems that this MacBook can take more than 8GB, but not as much as 16. Which is strange, but never mind.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d have to say, though, that the difference in performance wasn&rsquo;t obvious. But I didn&rsquo;t spend  lot of time with it like that, because I still had the SSD to install. That&rsquo;s very slightly more involved, needing as it does a Torx screwdriver. But it&rsquo;s very easy.</p>\n<p>Before all that I had made sure my old hard drive was thoroughly backed up, you won&rsquo;t be surprised to hear.</p>\n<p>I booted up in the new configuration and told the Mac to set itself up as a new installation. It downloaded El Capitan over the air and installed away.</p>\n<p>There was one slight glitch in this process. Something went wrong with the installation and I started getting a kernel panic on bootup. I don&rsquo;t quite recall the details now, but I just reformatted the SSD and installed again, and it all went fine.</p>\n<p>And the difference&hellip; The difference is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->astonishing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Even with many apps open (I currently have twelve), and a whole stack of tabs in Safari, using it is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->effortless<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

I just got  series of three beeps, repeated every few seconds.\n\nA bit of googling told me that means \"bad memory,\" essentially.\n\nI tried taking it out an putting it back in, swapping round which module was in which slot, and so on, but to no avail. I put the old memory back just to check that I hadn't damaged  something, and it started up like before.\n\nSo it looked like OWC were wrong, and I was restricted to 8GB. I was considering sending the memory back to Crucial and hoping I could get I refund. But then I tried one more thing. One of the new 8GB sticks along with one of the old 2GB ones.\n\nAnd it booted up, smooth as a cliche.\n\nOf course I tried swapping out one 8GB stick for the other, to check for the possibility that one of them actually was bad. But both of them worked. So it seems that this MacBook can take more than 8GB, but not as much as 16. Which is strange, but never mind.\n\nI'd have to say, though, that the difference in performance wasn't obvious. But I didn't spend  lot of time with it like that, because I still had the SSD to install. That's very slightly more involved, needing as it does a Torx screwdriver. But it's very easy.\n\nBefore all that I had made sure my old hard drive was thoroughly backed up, you won't be surprised to hear.\n\nI booted up in the new configuration and told the Mac to set itself up as a new installation. It downloaded El Capitan over the air and installed away.\n\nThere was one slight glitch in this process. Something went wrong with the installation and I started getting a kernel panic on bootup. I don't quite recall the details now, but I just reformatted the SSD and installed again, and it all went fine.\n\nAnd the difference... The difference is <em>astonishing</em>. Even with many apps open (I currently have twelve), and a whole stack of tabs in Safari, using it is <em>effortless</em>. Apps switch without the slightest lag. I can start anything up with only a few bounces. I've hardly even <em>seen</em> the rainbow.\n\nEven Lightroom, which is the heaviest-weight app I use on here, starts in under ten seconds.\n\nIn short, this is the way a computer should be.</p></body></html>\n",

For Jeremy Corbyn.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a member of the party before.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> I always thought that I was too independent to toe a party line; too many of my anarchist ideals, forged in the fires of punk, still stood.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe. But my anarchism, such as it was, was always on the socialist wing. And I recognise the idealism that drove it. I&rsquo;d like to think that humans could live without governments and leaders &ndash; that we are perfectible, and could form a working society through cooperation. But the fact is, of course, that that is not yet the case. And until it is, there are things worth standing up for, worth believing in. Worth fighting for.</p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to toe a line; but in May we crossed a line. After five years of a Tory government in all but name, we have a named one. David Cameron and his regime will go down in history as worse than Thatcher&rsquo;s; but until he does go down, we have to deal with the effects of it.</p>\n<p>On the morning after the election I resolved to join the Labour party and do what I could to help. This wasn&rsquo;t about electing a new leader, though I realised that would be part of it. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t about Jeremy Corbyn: I made the decision before Ed Miliband had even resigned, and enacted it before the leadership candidates had been nominated.</p>\n<p>And for what it&rsquo;s worth, I joined as a full member, not one of these ¬£3 Supporters that we&rsquo;ve been hearing so much about.</p>\n<p>I think the aftermath of the Scottish referendum had some effect on my decision. Seeing how the failure of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote energised the SNP and led many supporters to join led me to hope that something similar would happen with Labour.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>There has been little in the news lately but the refugee crisis and the Labour leadership election. I'm here to talk, briefly, before the polls close on Thursday, about the latter.\n\nI just voted, and guess what? For Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nI've never been a member of the party before.[^fn1] I always thought that I was too independent to toe a party line; too many of my anarchist ideals, forged in the fires of punk, still stood.\n\nWell, maybe. But my anarchism, such as it was, was always on the socialist wing. And I recognise the idealism that drove it. I'd like to think that humans could live without governments and leaders -- that we are perfectible, and could form a working society through cooperation. But the fact is, of course, that that is not yet the case. And until it is, there are things worth standing up for, worth believing in. Worth fighting for.\n\nI didn't want to toe a line; but in May we crossed a line. After five years of a Tory government in all but name, we have a named one. David Cameron and his regime will go down in history as worse than Thatcher's; but until he does go down, we have to deal with the effects of it.\n\nOn the morning after the election I resolved to join the Labour party and do what I could to help. This wasn't about electing a new leader, though I realised that would be part of it. It certainly wasn't about Jeremy Corbyn: I made the decision before Ed Miliband had even resigned, and enacted it before the leadership candidates had been nominated.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I joined as a full member, not one of these ¬£3 Supporters that we've been hearing so much about.\n\nI think the aftermath of the Scottish referendum had some effect on my decision. Seeing how the failure of the \"Yes\" vote energised the SNP and led many supporters to join led me to hope that something similar would happen with Labour. As indeed it has.\n\nAnyway, getting back to that choice of leader. It's long past time that Labour had a woman as its leader, but neither of those standing are right for me. Where we are right now, Corbyn's views most closely match my own values. When he says things like this:\n\n</p><blockquote>\n  Paying tax is not a burden. It is the subscription we pay to live in a civilised society.\n  \n  -- \"<a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/jeremyforlabour/pages/70/attachments/original/1437556345/TheEconomyIn2020_JeremyCorbyn-220715.pdf?1437556345\">The Economy in 2020</a>\"\n</blockquote>\n\nthat is exactly the kind of thing I've been saying about tax for years.\n\nThere is much else. I'm not convinced about leaving NATO, but I don't think it's a fundamental policy. I do think we shouldn't waste vast amounts of money on replacing Trident. The cold war is over, more or less.[^fn2] And even if Russia is getting alarmingly expansionist these days, a British not-really-independent nuclear missile submarine is going to worry them much.\n\nCorbyn might not be electable -- I doubt that analysis, but let's go with it for now -- but he should at least lead a Labour party in opposition that <em>actually opposes the government</em>. Which, with its slim majority, could actually be vulnerable.\n\nInteresting times ahead.</body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: The title of my blog is partly a nod to my long-time support of it, though.\n\n\n\n[^fn2]: I nearly typed \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars\">the cod war</a>\", which is also long over, but was much less terrifying.\n",

This includes women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ authors along with a¬†wide variety of other marginalized identities from which to create a reading list: people with disabilities; poor and working class authors; writers with non-Christian religious or spiritual beliefs; and for Americans, even reading books in translation by authors of any background will open up new viewpoints.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhich, when you list as many categories of author as that, sounds pretty easy. And so it is.\n\nSo far, as you'll have seen from my published notes to date, I've just read books by women. No trouble there. I'm currently reading <cite>Wild Seed</cite> by Octavia E Butler, which also adds African-American to the mix.\n\nThe only problem -- and it is, let's face it, a very minor one -- is when I see a book on my shelves that I think, \"Oh, I must read that;\" and then I think, \"but not this year.\" (Though it occurs that if I were to take \"writers with non-Christian religious or spiritual beliefs\" at face value, then I could, for example, carry on my Iain Banks re-read; but such writers -- atheist writers, at least -- are far from marginalised in Britain.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>A Christmas present: started on Christmas Day and finished just after midnight on the 3rd of January. So I could call it 2015 number 1, but it makes more sense to go with the year in which I started it and read most of it. Anyway, it‚Äôs all a bit arbitrary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vivalbertine.com\">Viv Albertine</a>, as I‚Äôm sure you know, was the guitarist in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Slits\">The Slits</a>. They had only a short time in punk‚Äôs limelight (though as I learned from this, they released a second album, not just the one I‚Äôm familiar with).</p>\n<p>This book is half about her early years and the punk days, and half about after. She went on to work as a filmmaker and then struggled to have a child, had serious health problems. Eventually she re-taught herself to play guitar, and started performing again (I <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/11/13/smashing-things-up-for-35-years/\">saw her supporting the Damned</a> a couple of years back, and then supporting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devilgate/statuses/345925502747435008?tw_i=345925502747435008&amp;tw_e=details&amp;tw_p=archive\">Siouxsie at Meltdown</a> a year and half back).</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs really interesting reading about a time I lived through, events I experienced ‚Äî from afar, true, but still ones I felt part of ‚Äî from someone else‚Äôs point of view. Especially that of someone who was at the heart of many of the events.</p>\n<p>And she writes with some style; it‚Äôs a compelling read. She makes some strange choices: for example, she only ever refers to her sister as ‚Äúmy sister‚Äù; we never get her name. Similarly with the man she marries. At first he‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Biker‚Äù, and then ‚Äúmy husband‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I suppose it‚Äôs a matter of protecting the privacy of people who are still alive ‚Äî especially in the latter case, because he doesn‚Äôt come out of it terribly well. Indeed, it may be the case that the only people who are named are those who were already in the public eye to some degree.</p>\n<p>Any road, if you are into music, especially punk, at all, I would highly recommend reading this. I plan to get her new album ‚Äî which came out two years ago, it turns out ‚Äî <cite>The Vermilion Border</cite>.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>There is a solution to one of the great constitutional questions of our age, and I have it.\n\nNot, I might add, the question of making parliament more representative (that‚Äôs actually quite an easy one, and we even had a referendum on making it a bit better in this parliament, but we voted the wrong way). Nor indeed the one triggered by the Scottish referendum. It's not even the most basic problem of our constitution, though I'll answer that in passing: write it down.\n\nNo, I‚Äôm speaking of the problem of the head of state. Now it seems to me to be uncontentious to say that we need to move from a hereditary system to an elected one. The existence of a hereditary element to the government of a democracy is anathema; this is plain.\n\nBut if you suggest this to many (perhaps still most) British citizens,[^fn1] they will speak of a great affection for the Queen; maybe for the monarchy as an institution; and for the pageantry, and how great it is for tourism. Plus they‚Äôd point to recent less-than-impressive examples of US presidents, and say something like, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want President Tony Blair.\"\nWell, I could argue against any or all of those. But there‚Äôs no need to. Here‚Äôs the thing: as soon as we want to, we could switch to having an elected head of state, <em>without</em> losing any of the positives there, or introducing the negatives.\n\nWell, we‚Äôd have to lose the Queen; the actual, current one, Elizabeth II. But that‚Äôs no problem: there won‚Äôt be any serious talk of change in her lifetime anyway. And probably not in Charlie‚Äôs for that matter.\nBut at some point in the future we could have an elected head of state, and still keep the monarchy, the pageantry, and the palaces.\n\nHow?

And I wanted to read this expanded edition when it first came out. Although it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúThe Final Chapter‚Äù, as if it were purely an additional piece, it contains both the original book and the new work ‚Äî which is a lot more than just a ‚Äúchapter‚Äù. But it was always just ferociously expensive. </p>\n<p>Like, old-school hardback price for a large-format paperback. And it never seemed to come down, or come to in a smaller-size, mass-market paperback edition. So it always just felt too daunting.</p>\n<p>Then eventually I saw it was on Kindle for what seemed like a more reasonable price, so I grabbed it.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs nothing more or less than an edited, long, email conversation between Davies and Cook. Sometimes several emails a day, in which Cook asks Davies questions about the latter‚Äôs writing process and other aspects of making <cite>Doctor Who</cite> (and to a lesser extent <cite>Torchwood</cite> and <cite>The Sarah Jane Adventures</cite>).</p>\n<p>And it‚Äôs absolutely fascinating read, especially if you‚Äôre at all interested in the creative process, in how writers write, and so on. It also feels a bit like you‚Äôre eavesdropping on someone else‚Äôs conversation at times, Somehow that‚Äôs not a problem, though. After all, it‚Äôs an interesting conversation, and we‚Äôve been invited to listen in.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs clear that Davies enjoys sharing his thoughts on his process in this way, and it sort of makes you wonder why he doesn‚Äôt blog. But then, if he had been writing these emails as blog posts at the time, he couldn‚Äôt possibly have shared as much as he did with Cook, and with us several years after the events.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>It seems like a curious choice for the Liberal Democrats to have their national conference in Glasgow this year, what with everything else that‚Äôs been going on in Scotland. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre very popular there.</p>\n<p>Then again, they‚Äôre not very popular anywhere.</p>\n<p>Back before the the coalition, when the Lib Dems were the third party, they always spoke in favour of coalition government. They always said that they would work with anyone if it they ever held the balance of power.</p>\n<p>Then when it looked there was going to be a hung parliament, and when there actually was, they still said that they would work with either Labour or the Tories in order to bring a government into being.</p>\n<p>The trouble is, no-one really believed them.</p>\n<p>OK, I can only really speak for myself; but I‚Äôm probably not that unusual. The Lib Dems were always seen as being closer to Labour than to the Tories. There was the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib%E2%80%93Lab_pact\">Lib-Lab pact</a> back in the seventies. And all through the New Labour years, they were generally seen as being further left than Labour.</p>\n<p>So when they held the balance of power in 2010, it was obvious ‚Äî so we all thought, I say ‚Äî that they would work with Labour, rather than the Tories.</p>\n<p>Alas, it was not to be. Imagine how different the country might be now if Clegg had swung the right way back then. The country wouldn‚Äôt have been half-destroyed by Osbourne‚Äôs ‚Äúausterity‚Äù measures. (I mean, <em>really</em>: haven‚Äôt they learned by now that you don‚Äôt cut public spending in a recession?)</p>\n<p>Of course, there have been some good things during the coalition: marriage equality; the Scottish referendum (irrespective of how it turned out, Cameron agreed to it). There was even ‚Äî if you recall ‚Äî a referendum on electoral reform. Remember that?</p>\n<p>No, me neither. It was a fix (since it got voted down), but I don‚Äôt recall how. Oh, yes wait: the anti-reform camp <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/05/03/lets-all-say-yes/\">made a big thing</a> of how much more complex than first-past-the-post the alternative vote (AV) system would be. When in fact it‚Äôs <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/kk2lZ.jpg\">quite simple</a>. And I guess they got the friendly media working against it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, now they‚Äôve been all but wiped out in yesterday‚Äôs by election. The worst thing about that is that UKIP seem to be in danger of replacing them as the third party.</p>\n<p>Scary but interesting times.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

The &ldquo;40% Rule&rdquo;, which caused the referendum to fail (the majority had to comprise 40% of the electorate) was brought in by a Labour MP&rsquo;s amendment; and when it fell, according to the Wikipedia article:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>That election was the one that got Thatcher elected.</p>\n<p>Maybe she&rsquo;d have been elected at the next election whenever it happened; but maybe not.

Labour should support democratic freedom and the right of small countries to govern themselves. Trouble is, so many Labour MPs are Scottish, and they can see power at Westminster slipping further and further from their grasp if they don&rsquo;t have the effect of all those Scottish seats.</p>\n<p>I can understand that, though. that aspect of potential independence worries me, too: selfishly, I want to keep Scotland as part of the UK because I fear the effect of it leaving and us losing the balancing power of its more left-wing nature. Without Scotland, the rest of the UK could be doomed to near-permanent Tory governments. Or worse; UKIP along with the extremely anti-EU rump of the Tories when they split (it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will<!-- raw HTML omitted --> happen, the only questions are when, and how many MPs will go).</p>\n<p>Being stuck in an RoUK that votes to leave the EU? That is distinctly unappealing</p>\n<p>Just as a minor aside, something I had totally forgotten was that the 1979 referendum wasn&rsquo;t for independence: it was only to have an assembly, which sounds a lot like the Scottish Parliament of today.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I used the term &ldquo;RoUK&rdquo; above. That&rsquo;s the way people have been referring to the &ldquo;rest of the UK&rdquo;, meaning what&rsquo;s left of the UK after Scotland leaves. But I&rsquo;m not so sure that there should really be any such thing.</p>\n<p>See, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland came into existence when the Republic of Ireland got its independence from Britain, leaving Northern Ireland still connected. But the &ldquo;Great Britain&rdquo; part (as a political entity, as opposed to the island): <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that came into existence with the Acts of Union<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>Repeal those Acts and arguably Great Britain ceases to exist as a political entity; so how can the UK exist after that happens?</p>\n<p>So rather than debating whether an independent Scotland will be able to remain in the EU will have to rejoin it from outside, we should be discussing what, exactly, will be left if Scotland leaves the union.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It disturbs me how many Scots seem to be basing their decision around personality. &ldquo;Salmond&rsquo;s a wanker&rdquo;, and all that kind of thing. If the vote goes yes, Salmond can retire (arguably the SNP will no longer have a reason to exist, in fact). But anyway, governments change, they can be voted out; people die. It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re voting to make Salmond president for life.

The \"40% Rule\", which caused the referendum to fail (the majority had to comprise 40% of the electorate) was brought in by a Labour MP's amendment; and when it fell, according to the Wikipedia article:\n\n<blockquote>\n  the government's decision to abandon devolution for Scotland led the Scottish National Party to withdraw its support for the government. A subsequent vote of no confidence led to the resignation of the Callaghan government, and an election was called.\n</blockquote>\n\nThat election was the one that got Thatcher elected.\n\nMaybe she'd have been elected at the next election whenever it happened; but maybe not. And I can't help but think that the Labour party has a disturbing sideline in betraying the people it should be serving, and this -- and the current Labour party's staunchly pro-union stance -- is an example of it. Labour should support democratic freedom and the right of small countries to govern themselves. Trouble is, so many Labour MPs are Scottish, and they can see power at Westminster slipping further and further from their grasp if they don't have the effect of all those Scottish seats.\n\nI can understand that, though. that aspect of potential independence worries me, too: selfishly, I want to keep Scotland as part of the UK because I fear the effect of it leaving and us losing the balancing power of its more left-wing nature. Without Scotland, the rest of the UK could be doomed to near-permanent Tory governments. Or worse; UKIP along with the extremely anti-EU rump of the Tories when they split (it <em>will</em> happen, the only questions are when, and how many MPs will go).\n\nBeing stuck in an RoUK that votes to leave the EU? That is distinctly unappealing\n\nJust as a minor aside, something I had totally forgotten was that the 1979 referendum wasn't for independence: it was only to have an assembly, which sounds a lot like the Scottish Parliament of today.\n\n<h2>The Rest?</h2>\n\nI used the term \"RoUK\" above. That's the way people have been referring to the \"rest of the UK\", meaning what's left of the UK after Scotland leaves. But I'm not so sure that there should really be any such thing.\n\nSee, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland came into existence when the Republic of Ireland got its independence from Britain, leaving Northern Ireland still connected. But the \"Great Britain\" part (as a political entity, as opposed to the island): <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain\">that came into existence with the Acts of Union</a>.\n\nRepeal those Acts and arguably Great Britain ceases to exist as a political entity; so how can the UK exist after that happens?\n\nSo rather than debating whether an independent Scotland will be able to remain in the EU will have to rejoin it from outside, we should be discussing what, exactly, will be left if Scotland leaves the union.\n\n<h2>Salmond and the anti-personality cult</h2>\n\nIt disturbs me how many Scots seem to be basing their decision around personality. \"Salmond's a wanker\", and all that kind of thing. If the vote goes yes, Salmond can retire (arguably the SNP will no longer have a reason to exist, in fact). But anyway, governments change, they can be voted out; people die. It's not like you're voting to make Salmond president for life. Rather, you're voting for the type of country that your children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren will inherit.\n\n<h2>Other voices</h2>\n\nBefore I end, some other pieces that I've been reading on the matter. As <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/irvine-welsh-the-scots-poll-can-give-hope-to-the-left-across-britain-9559111.html\">Irvine Welsh has said</a>, this is a great time for political engagement in Scotland.[^fn3] And <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/comment/columnists/why-scottish-independence-would-help-england-to-rediscover-its-radical-heart.25189347\">Billy Bragg adds</a> that it might be good politically for England too.\n\nAnd <a href=\"http://upholdingenglishhonour.com/2014/07/16/dear-eddie-izzard-and-friends-please-dont-go-on-please-listen-to-why-its-ok-for-us-english-to-let-scotland-go/\">here's a blog by an English guy</a> who favours Scottish independence. He also favours English and Welsh independence, it seems: the complete breakup of the UK; just look at his masthead. His blog has the slightly disturbing title of \"Upholding English Honour\", but he doesn't seem to be the little Englander that name might imply.\n\n<a href=\"http://forums.millarworld.tv/index.php?/topic/104960-i-keep-seeing-this-disinfo-on-scotlands-voting-record/\">Mark Millar is undecided</a>, but calls for better behaviour all round in the debate. And <a href=\"http://jackdeighton.co.uk/2014/07/26/scotlands-literature-and-scottish-independence/\">Jack Deighton considers the effect that the referendum might have on Scottish literature</a>.\n\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\n\nIn the end, of course, my opinion means nothing. But here it is anyway. If I were living in Scotland, I'm now fairly sure that I'd be voting yes. And speaking as an attached outsider, I'm coming round to hoping that the vote goes that way; if only to see what happens next.\n\nAfter all, it could be the beginning of a great adventure.</body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: That post is actually about floating voters; not quite the same thing, but not unrelated.\n\n[^fn2]: Weirdly, when I searched Amazon for Hugh MacDiarmid's <cite>A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle</cite>, the second hit was <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Scotland-Our-Britain-Sharing-ebook/dp/B00IQ8UBVG/\"><cite>My Scotland, Our Britain: A Future Worth Sharing</cite>, by Gordon Brown</a>.\n\n\n[^fn3]: That link is showing \"Service unavailable\" at the time of writing.

He is leaving New York for Puerto Rico, to take up a post on the English-language paper there.</p>\n<p>The story charts the ups and downs of his life over the next few months, along with various other people, mainly involved with the paper. It‚Äôs an entertaining enough read, but largely inconsequential as a story. You couldn‚Äôt really say that the character has grown or developed much by the end, and while we get some insight into the way the US was interacting with Puerto Rico at the time (unspoilt beaches being sold to developers to build luxury hotel complexes, that kind of thing), I wouldn‚Äôt say you get a great sense of Puerto Rico itself.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs mainly interesting for showing some early flashes of the writing style that Thompson would develop over the subsequent years into his signature gonzo style.

That brought me to <cite>Excession</cite>, in many ways Banksie‚Äôs Culture masterwork. Certainly it‚Äôs‚Äã the first in which the ships take such central, starring roles, which makes it the defining one for me.</p>\n<p>I remembered much more of this (I‚Äôve definitely read it more than once before), but there were still bits that were only fuzzy at best. It is galaxy-spanning, ‚Äúwidescreen baroque‚Äù space opera at its best.</p>\n<p>I hadn‚Äôt finished it by the time we went on holiday, so I had to take it with me with only a hundred or so pages to go. That was mildly annoying, but it didn‚Äôt take us over our weight limit.</p>\n<p>The next Culture novel to be published is <cite>Inversions</cite>, but I didn‚Äôt quite feel like reading it, because I was keen to get to <cite>Look to Windward</cite>. I feel as if I‚Äôve been wanting to reread that almost since I first read it. So I took it with me, and with only a brief interruption to finish <cite>The Magus</cite> in the appropriate country, as <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2013/09/21/the-summer-of-rereading-1-the-magus-by-john-fowles/\">I‚Äôve already discussed</a>, I stormed into it.</p>\n<p>And, err, it was a bit disappointing, actually.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs the thing about not remembering books though: I remembered almost nothing about this. I <em>thought</em> I remembered it, but really I only had the setup (the business of waiting for the light from the stars destroyed in the Culture-Idiran War to arrive) and one brief scene near the end. This had the great positive that it was almost like reading a new Culture novel.</p>\n<p>The trouble with it is that the plot is quite thin, and mostly happening off stage. And a lot of the events that happen in between‚Äã are only really there to show off some of the fantasicness of living on a Culture orbital. In a sense it tries to do exactly what Banksie himself said you can‚Äôt really do, which is to set a story in a utopia. This is why the Culture novels general focus on someone working for Special Circumstances or at least Contact; they happen at the edges of the utopia, or just outside its fringes, where things are a lot more dangerous.</p>\n<p>There is an ongoing threat to at least one of the main characters, but it doesn‚Äôt really engage us all that much. We don‚Äôt, perhaps, care all that much about what happens to them.</p>\n<p>That said, there are still some great moments. But I wonder whether my expectations, set by my memory of really enjoying it, were too high. It‚Äôs often best to approach artistic works with lowered expectations.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note: contains spoilers<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Early on &ndash; maybe it was still spring &ndash; when we booked our holiday to Greece, I decided it was time to reread <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Magus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I read it something like thirty years ago, when I was at university. I remember enjoying it, but being annoyed by the ending.</p>\n<p>So I was expecting that annoyance to still be there. On occasions between then and this rereading, I have looked at the last couple of pages. I did so again before starting it this time; it was no clearer for doing so. Fowles himself recognised problems with the ending. In his foreword to the revised edition, he acknowledges that the novel has flaws, not least that it is a novel of adolescence, both his and that of his protagonist. (I found Nicholas to be annoyingly adolescent and spoilt, especially at the start, on this reading.) He goes on to say:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>(Ellipsis the author&rsquo;s, incidentally.) The thing is, he hasn&rsquo;t done so. Not really. Not if you want to know whether or not Nicholas and Alison get back together, which seems to have been what his correspondents regarding the original edition were concerned about.</p>\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not what bothered me, either then or now. I don&rsquo;t mind an ambiguous ending. And I actually kind of like the way you can think of it as a freeze-frame, like the ending of a film (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bonnie and Clyde<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ends like that, if I remember correctly &ndash; though in a more dramatic event).<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>No, what annoys me is that we never really learn what Conchis and the others were up to. They called their project &ldquo;The Godgame&rdquo; (it was also Fowles&rsquo;s proposed title for the novel at one point); but what was the point of it? What were they trying to achieve?</p>\n<p>Ultimately I suppose that can be answered in part by Fowles&rsquo;s argument regarding people asking about the &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of the novel:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So the Godgame&rsquo;s meaning or purpose may be simply the reaction it provokes in Nicholas; but that still leaves us wondering, as I said above, why did Conchis do it? Was it just the whim of a rich man? He did it because he could? And yet mere whim feels weak alongside all the discussion of freedom and what it means.</p>\n<p>In the end the mild sense of frustration remains, because we never find that out.</p>\n<p>Back when I first read it, there was no immediately obvious way to find discussions of it. No doubt there were some in academic journals and theses, but finding those would have been difficult. Now, of course, such discussions are easy to find. And the most interesting one I found recently was by Jo Walton on Tor.com: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twists of the Godgame: John Fowles&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Magus<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As Walton says, the ending &ldquo;twists at just the wrong moment and sends it away from metaphysics into triviality and romance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She goes on to compare it to Ted Chiang‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Story of Your Life‚Äù, which I haven&rsquo;t read. But the argument that &ldquo;Fowles doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing, that the underlying reality that is never explained doesn‚Äôt make sense&rdquo; rings true for me. And so when she says that &ldquo;what Chiang‚Äôs &lsquo;The Story of Your Life&rsquo; does is what Fowles may have wanted to do&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m inclined to suspect that she&rsquo;ll be proved right when I come to read the Chiang.</p>\n<p>I still loved the book, though: you can enjoy the journey even if you&rsquo;re not entirely happy with the destination. Walton&rsquo;s conclusion gives a hilarious suggestion for how it could have been improved, though:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Now that would have been an ending.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Apparently there was a film of the book made.

I read it something like thirty years ago, when I was at university. I remember enjoying it, but being annoyed by the ending.\n\nSo I was expecting that annoyance to still be there. On occasions between then and this rereading, I have looked at the last couple of pages. I did so again before starting it this time; it was no clearer for doing so. Fowles himself recognised problems with the ending. In his foreword to the revised edition, he acknowledges that the novel has flaws, not least that it is a novel of adolescence, both his and that of his protagonist. (I found Nicholas to be annoyingly adolescent and spoilt, especially at the start, on this reading.) He goes on to say:\n\n</p><blockquote>\n  The other change is in the ending. Though its general intent has never seemed to me as obscure as some readers have evidently found it -- perhaps because they have not given due weight to the two lines from the <cite>Pervigilium Veneris</cite> that close the book -- I accept that I might have declared a preferred aftermath less ambiguously‚Ä¶ and have now done so.\n</blockquote>\n\n(Ellipsis the author's, incidentally.) The thing is, he hasn't done so. Not really. Not if you want to know whether or not Nicholas and Alison get back together, which seems to have been what his correspondents regarding the original edition were concerned about.\n\nBut that's not what bothered me, either then or now. I don't mind an ambiguous ending. And I actually kind of like the way you can think of it as a freeze-frame, like the ending of a film (<cite>Bonnie and Clyde</cite> ends like that, if I remember correctly -- though in a more dramatic event).[^fn1]\n\nNo, what annoys me is that we never really learn what Conchis and the others were up to. They called their project \"The Godgame\" (it was also Fowles's proposed title for the novel at one point); but what was the point of it? What were they trying to achieve?\n\nUltimately I suppose that can be answered in part by Fowles's argument regarding people asking about the \"meaning\" of the novel:\n\n<blockquote>\n  If <cite>The Magus</cite> has any \"real significance\", it is no more than that of the Rorschach Test in psychology. Its meaning is whatever reaction it provokes in the reader[.]\n</blockquote>\n\nSo the Godgame's meaning or purpose may be simply the reaction it provokes in Nicholas; but that still leaves us wondering, as I said above, why did Conchis do it? Was it just the whim of a rich man? He did it because he could? And yet mere whim feels weak alongside all the discussion of freedom and what it means.\n\nIn the end the mild sense of frustration remains, because we never find that out.\n\nBack when I first read it, there was no immediately obvious way to find discussions of it. No doubt there were some in academic journals and theses, but finding those would have been difficult. Now, of course, such discussions are easy to find. And the most interesting one I found recently was by Jo Walton on Tor.com: <a href=\"http://www.tor.com/blogs/2009/11/twists-of-the-godgame-john-fowless-lemgthe-maguslemg\">Twists of the Godgame: John Fowles's <cite>The Magus</cite></a>. As Walton says, the ending \"twists at just the wrong moment and sends it away from metaphysics into triviality and romance.\"\n\nShe goes on to compare it to Ted Chiang‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Story of Your Life‚Äù, which I haven't read. But the argument that \"Fowles doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing, that the underlying reality that is never explained doesn‚Äôt make sense\" rings true for me. And so when she says that \"what Chiang‚Äôs 'The Story of Your Life' does is what Fowles may have wanted to do\", I'm inclined to suspect that she'll be proved right when I come to read the Chiang.\n\nI still loved the book, though: you can enjoy the journey even if you're not entirely happy with the destination. Walton's conclusion gives a hilarious suggestion for how it could have been improved, though:\n\n<blockquote>\n  It‚Äôs beautifully written. The characters are so real I‚Äôd recognise them if I saw them at the bus-stop. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it that couldn‚Äôt be fixed by having them go off in an alien space ship at the end.\n</blockquote>\n\nNow that would have been an ending.</body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: Apparently there was a film of the book made. It's considered to be so bad that (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magus_%28novel%29\">according to Wikipedia</a>) Woody Allen said if he had his life to live again he'd do everything the same, except he wouldn't see <cite>The Magus</cite>.\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>With <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite> fever in full swing (to mix a metaphor), I've been thinking about the book a lot today. I tweeted yesterday that I had never really got what all the fuss was about.\n\n</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Want to see the _Great Gatsby_ movie, yet despite re-reading the book last summer, I fail to see what people think is so good about it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23fb\">#fb</a>‚Äî Martin McCallion (@devilgate) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devilgate/status/336140686527168514\">May 19, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>I find it hard to explain what I find problematic about it. I wouldn't say it's <em>bad</em>, just that it's not as good as nearly everyone says it is. I see it as largely being about rich people having parties, and a couple of tragic deaths. And while I don't think that you have to like -- or even identify with -- all the characters for fiction to work, in this case none of them has any redeeming feature, as far as I can tell.\n\nThere's a recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/03/what-makes-great-gatsby\">article in the Guardian by Sarah Churchwell</a> about how wonderful it all is. It's a well-written piece, but I find it just as hard to get to grips with, to understand the point of, as the novel itself.\n\nSo I did a search for \"Gatsby overrated\", and found <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/05/schulz-on-the-great-gatsby.html\">this piece by Kathryn Schulz</a> which absolutely nails it.\n\nOne point she makes perhaps helps to explain why I find the characters so objectionable:\n\n</p><blockquote>\n  Like many American moralists, Fitzgerald was more offended by pleasure than by vice, and he had a tendency to confound them. In The Great Gatsby, polo and golf are more morally suspect than murder.\n</blockquote>\n\nAnd:\n\n<blockquote>\n  On the page, Fitzgerald‚Äôs moralizing instinct comes off as cold; the chill that settles around The Great Gatsby is an absence of empathy.\n</blockquote>\n\nMy favourite part is her parenthetical assertion that:\n\n<blockquote>\n  In a literary hostage exchange, I would trade a thousand Fitzgeralds for one Edward St. Aubyn, 10,000 for an Austen or Dickens.\n</blockquote>\n\nThough I had to look up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_St_Aubyn\">Edward St. Aubyn</a>.\n\nBut her main argument concerns the shallowness of the characterisations, the emphasis on symbolism over emotion:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Of the great, redemptive romance on which the entire story is supposed to turn, he admitted, ‚ÄúI gave no account (and had no feeling about or knowledge of) the emotional relations between Gatsby and Daisy.‚Äù\n  \n  What was Fitzgerald doing instead of figuring out such things about his characters? Precision-engineering his plot, chiefly, and putting in overtime at the symbol factory.\n</blockquote>\n\nFor me, though, as I think on it some more, the problem with it all (and in contradiction to the last quote above) is the thinness of the plot. The prose is famously poetic in places, and that's fine; but the real weakness is that there's almost no story there.\n\nAnd that famous last line[^fn1]?  Poetic though it is, when you parse it, it means absolutely nothing at all.</body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: \"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\", as I'm sure you know.\n",

My concerns were the cost, the crowding, and the general disruption of it all.  I was, I admit, cynical.  I recall being annoyed by the fact that the people running the bid published a number to which you could text &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, to say you supported the bid; but there was no option to text &ldquo;no&rdquo; to say you opposed it.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking back to what I wrote at the time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I see that my biggest concern was the effect on the Lower Lee Valley.  It turned out that the removal of wilderness didn&rsquo;t stretch as far as my fears suggested; and of course much of the land that has been used was polluted, abandoned, brownfield industrial sites.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><h2>Initial scepticism</h2>\n\nBack in 2004, 2005 or so, when London was bidding to host the Olympics, I was against it.  My concerns were the cost, the crowding, and the general disruption of it all.  I was, I admit, cynical.  I recall being annoyed by the fact that the people running the bid published a number to which you could text \"yes\", to say you supported the bid; but there was no option to text \"no\" to say you opposed it.\n\n<a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2005/07/06/2012/\">Looking back to what I wrote at the time</a>, I see that my biggest concern was the effect on the Lower Lee Valley.  It turned out that the removal of wilderness didn't stretch as far as my fears suggested; and of course much of the land that has been used was polluted, abandoned, brownfield industrial sites.  Bob Stanley of St Etienne (the band) has an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/24/olympics-changed-lower-lea-valley?mobile-redirect=false\">interesting piece in <cite>The Guardian</cite></a> about that.\n\n<h2>Coming round</h2>\n\nBut then London won the bid, and I though, \"OK, fine, it'll be interesting at least.\"  I had enjoyed watching the previous ones, and there was the regeneration for East London that looked promising.  And the fact that it would just be down the road for me added to the interest.  After all, that would make it easier to get tickets, right?  Obviously there would specific tickets made available to to locals.\n\nHindsight even makes me wonder whether the <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2005/07/07/today/\">events of the very next day</a> didn't make me more supportive: blitz spirit, don't let the bastards grind you down, \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power\">soft power</a>\", and all that.\n\n<h2>The intervening years</h2>\n\n<h3>Worries</h3>\n\nIn the years since then I've gone through various thoughts about the whole thing.

Of course more recently we've had the G4S fiasco, and the drafting in of extra soldiers.\n\nMore bizarrely we've seen the growth of the Olympic \"brand police\", the forbidding of certain words and combinations of words (including, ridiculously, things like \"summer\", \"bronze\", and \"2012\").\n\n<h3>Cycle-friendly or not?</h3>\n\nBut closer to home one of the things that has annoyed me is the way they've treated our towpath.\n\nThe main stadium sits between two branches of the River Lee (or Lea): the river itself, and the Lee Navigation or Cut, which is essentially a canal constructed as a tributary[^trib] of the main river.

				"title": "Tip: using Pandoc to create truly standalone HTML files",
				"content_html": "<p>If you‚Äôre using the excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pandoc<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to convert between different document formats, and you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>want your final output to be in HTML;</li>\n<li>want the HTML to be styled with CSS;</li>\n<li>and want the HTML document to be truly standalone;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>then read on.</p>\n<p>The most common approach with Pandoc is, I think, to write in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Markdown<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and then convert the output to RTF, PDF or HTML. There are all sorts of more advanced options too; but here we are only concerned with HTML.</p>\n<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pandoc<!-- raw HTML omitted --> command has an option which allows you to style the resulting HTML with CSS. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Example 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the User‚Äôs Guide shows how you do this, with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-c<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option. The example also uses the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option, which means that we are creating a standalone HTML document, as distinct from a fragment that is to be embedded in another document. The full command is:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\">pandoc -s -S --toc -c pandoc.css -A footer.html README -o example3.html\n</code></pre></div><p>If you inspect the generated HTML file after running this, you will see it contains a line like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-html\" data-lang=\"html\">&lt;<span style=\"color:#f92672\">link</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">rel</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;stylesheet&#34;</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">href</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;pandoc.css&#34;</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">type</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;text/css&#34;</span>&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>That links to the CSS stylesheet, keeping the formatting information separate from the content. Very good practice if you‚Äôre publishing a document on the web.</p>\n<p>But what about that ‚Äústandalone‚Äù idea that you expressed with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option? What that does is make sure that the HTML is a complete document, beginning with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DOCTYPE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag, an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;html&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag, and so on.

				"content_text": "\nIf you‚Äôre using the excellent <a title=\"A command-line tool for converting between various document formats.\" href=\"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html\">Pandoc</a> to convert between different document formats, and you:\n\n- want your final output to be in HTML;\n- want the HTML to be styled with CSS;\n- and want the HTML document to be truly standalone;\n\nthen read on.\n\nThe most common approach with Pandoc is, I think, to write in <a title=\"Plain-text writing for the web.\" href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a>, and then convert the output to RTF, PDF or HTML. There are all sorts of more advanced options too; but here we are only concerned with HTML.\n\nThe <code>pandoc</code> command has an option which allows you to style the resulting HTML with CSS. <a href=\"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demos.html\">Example 3</a> in the User‚Äôs Guide shows how you do this, with the <code>-c</code> option. The example also uses the <code>-s</code> option, which means that we are creating a standalone HTML document, as distinct from a fragment that is to be embedded in another document. The full command is:\n\n```shell\npandoc -s -S --toc -c pandoc.css -A footer.html README -o example3.html\n```\n\nIf you inspect the generated HTML file after running this, you will see it contains a line like this:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"pandoc.css\" type=\"text/css\">\n```\n\nThat links to the CSS stylesheet, keeping the formatting information separate from the content. Very good practice if you‚Äôre publishing a document on the web.\n\nBut what about that ‚Äústandalone‚Äù idea that you expressed with the <code>-s</code> option? What that does is make sure that the HTML is a complete document, beginning with a <code>DOCTYPE</code> tag, an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag, and so on. But if, for example, you have to email the document you just created, or upload it to your company‚Äôs document store, then things fall apart. When your reader opens it, they‚Äôll see what you wrote, all right; but it won‚Äôt be styled the way you wanted it. Because that <code>pandoc.css</code> file with the styling is back on your machine, in the same directory as the original Markdown file.\n\nWhat you really want is to use embedded CSS; you want the content of <code>pandoc.css</code> to be included along with the prose you wrote in your HTML file.\n\nLuckily HTML supports that, and Pandoc provides a way to make it all happen: the <code>-H</code> option, or using its long form, <code>--include-in-header=FILE</code>\n\nFirst you‚Äôll have to make sure that your <code>pandoc.css</code> file<sup><a id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnoteRef\" href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> starts and ends with HTML <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags, so it should look something like this:\n\n```html\n<style type=\"text/css\">\nbody {\n    margin: auto;\n    padding-right: 1em;\n    padding-left: 1em;\n    max-width: 44em; \n    border-left: 1px solid black;\n    border-right: 1px solid black;\n    color: black;\n    font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\n    font-size: 100%;\n    line-height: 140%;\n    color: #333; \n}\n</style>\n```\n\nThen run the <code>pandoc</code> command like this:\n\n```shell\npandoc -s -S --toc -H pandoc.css -A footer.html README -o example3.html\n```\n\nand you‚Äôre done. A fully standalone HTML document.\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr>\n\n<ol>\n    <li id=\"fn1\">It doesn‚Äôt have to be called that, by the way.<a href=\"#fnref1\">‚Ü©</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It&rsquo;s also just long; and technical.  So feel free to ignore.  I won&rsquo;t be offended.</p>\n<p>I rarely write about programming or other technical issues here, but I probably should do so more often.  Certainly in a case like this.</p>\n<p>I often think about the many, many problems that I&rsquo;ve had help with from strangers on the internet; people who have taken the time to write blog posts, answers to questions on forums, or technology tutorials.  My job would barely be possible at times without the web.  Of course, we didn&rsquo;t have it back when I started in 1987; but we didn&rsquo;t do such complex things, with so many different languages and technologies.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all these kind strangers have helped me, and I rarely find myself in a position to give anything back to the community.  So since I recently hit a problem that no-one else seems to have had, it&rsquo;s really my duty to describe it, and my solution, in the hope that it might be of use to someone down the line.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the solution to the problem with pass-by reference on WAS, and don&rsquo;t want to read the story of how I got there, you can jump straight to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New Bug<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We develop our main app using a fairly standard <!-- raw HTML omitted -->n-tier<!-- raw HTML omitted --> architecture using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JEE<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: web front end using JSPs and Struts; EJBs; a multiplicity of database platforms accessed using Spring.  All fairly standard stuff, whose purpose is to move financial messages around.</p>\n<p>A lot of this was originally developed when I wasn&rsquo;t around (I was seconded to another department) and by contractors and others who are no longer with us.  So I take no responsibility for the stupidities that exist in codebase.  Or rather, I accept no blame.  I do, in fact, have responsibility for it; for keeping it going and developing it onwards now.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>One of the bad choices that was made by the original developers of this version of the product, was that they should cache the results of database queries.  The users can define various criteria by which they want to select a set of messages to view; those get translated into SQL, which our Java code executes using JDBC.  Again, all standard stuff.  JDBC was designed for exactly that kind of thing.  Databases exist solely to do that kind of thing.</p>\n<p>So the wise and sensible developers decided that performance would be a problem if a query returned many rows from the database.  They decided that transferring the rows to the browser and allowing the user to scroll through them would be impossible.  So they designed a caching mechanism.</p>\n<p>Thing is, JDBC has that kind of caching built right in.  And furthermore, they (our developers) included a limit: a maximum number of rows to return, which could be set to 50, 100, 500, or 1000.  Pretty reasonable, since any query that returned over 200 or so rows is likely to be less than useful, anyway.</p>\n<p>But they still built that caching mechanism.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>That&rsquo;s all right, though, I hear you say.  Cache the rows server-side in memory, return a subset to the user as they page through them.  It sounds fine.</p>\n<p>True enough.  Except they didn&rsquo;t cache them in memory.  Oh no.  That would have been too sensible.  And might have caused performance problems (I&rsquo;m sure they thought, if they even considered they matter).  No, they cached them elsewhere.  Where?  In the database.</p>\n<p>Yes, they introduced another table; a shadow table; an almost-identical duplicate of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Messages<!-- raw HTML omitted --> table, called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MessageQueryResults<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>This has been kicking around, nearly finished, for months.  It's not going to get any better, or shorter, so it's long past time I put it out there.\n\nIt's also just long; and technical.  So feel free to ignore.  I won't be offended.\n\nI rarely write about programming or other technical issues here, but I probably should do so more often.  Certainly in a case like this.\n\nI often think about the many, many problems that I've had help with from strangers on the internet; people who have taken the time to write blog posts, answers to questions on forums, or technology tutorials.  My job would barely be possible at times without the web.  Of course, we didn't have it back when I started in 1987; but we didn't do such complex things, with so many different languages and technologies.\n\nAnyway, all these kind strangers have helped me, and I rarely find myself in a position to give anything back to the community.  So since I recently hit a problem that no-one else seems to have had, it's really my duty to describe it, and my solution, in the hope that it might be of use to someone down the line.\n\nIf you're looking for the solution to the problem with pass-by reference on WAS, and don't want to read the story of how I got there, you can jump straight to <a href=\"#newbug\">The New Bug</a>\n\n</p><h2>Background</h2>\n\nWe develop our main app using a fairly standard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture\">n-tier</a> architecture using <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2ee/overview.html\">JEE</a>: web front end using JSPs and Struts; EJBs; a multiplicity of database platforms accessed using Spring.  All fairly standard stuff, whose purpose is to move financial messages around.\n\nA lot of this was originally developed when I wasn't around (I was seconded to another department) and by contractors and others who are no longer with us.  So I take no responsibility for the stupidities that exist in codebase.  Or rather, I accept no blame.  I do, in fact, have responsibility for it; for keeping it going and developing it onwards now.[^fn1]\n\nOne of the bad choices that was made by the original developers of this version of the product, was that they should cache the results of database queries.  The users can define various criteria by which they want to select a set of messages to view; those get translated into SQL, which our Java code executes using JDBC.  Again, all standard stuff.  JDBC was designed for exactly that kind of thing.  Databases exist solely to do that kind of thing.\n\nSo the wise and sensible developers decided that performance would be a problem if a query returned many rows from the database.  They decided that transferring the rows to the browser and allowing the user to scroll through them would be impossible.  So they designed a caching mechanism.\n\nThing is, JDBC has that kind of caching built right in.  And furthermore, they (our developers) included a limit: a maximum number of rows to return, which could be set to 50, 100, 500, or 1000.  Pretty reasonable, since any query that returned over 200 or so rows is likely to be less than useful, anyway.\n\nBut they still built that caching mechanism.\n\n<h2>The Mechanism</h2>\n\nThat's all right, though, I hear you say.  Cache the rows server-side in memory, return a subset to the user as they page through them.  It sounds fine.\n\nTrue enough.  Except they didn't cache them in memory.  Oh no.  That would have been too sensible.  And might have caused performance problems (I'm sure they thought, if they even considered they matter).  No, they cached them elsewhere.  Where?  In the database.\n\nYes, they introduced another table; a shadow table; an almost-identical duplicate of the <code>Messages</code> table, called <code>MessageQueryResults</code>.  Executing a query then consisted of selecting the required rows and writing them into this table, keyed by the HTTP session ID; and then re-querying this results table to get a page worth of results.\n\nSo, to recap, then: to improve performance (<a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization\">without first determining that there was actually a problem</a>), they replaced a simple database read with a read, a set of writes, and another set of reads.\n\nThat was <em>bound</em> to perform better, right?\n\n<h2>The Failure</h2>\n\nIt wasn't performance that brought this flimsy edifice crashing down, though.[^fn2] No, it actually ran quite successfully for several years.  Three things brought about its end: Microsoft, multiplicity, and me.[^fn3]\n\nMicrosoft's part was through their database platform, SQL Server.  Between one version and another they changed something about their storage mechanism, so that you could no longer rely on rows on a table being in the sequence in which they were written to the table.  The thing is, you're not <em>supposed</em> to be able to rely on that, according to DB theory.  That was another flaw in the \"design\" above; it relied on the shadow table's rows being returned in the same sequence they were written in.  On Oracle and DB2 that worked; and it did on SQL Server too, until (if memory serves) the 2005 version.  This meant that clients on that platform who had large queries couldn't rely on them being displayed in the right order.\n\nOh dear.\n\nHacks were applied to sort this out.  Pun intended: sorting is pretty much what they did.  Not a fix, but a workaround at best.\n\nThe multiplicity part was that the same mechanism was used to query another table; and then a third.  And there was a fourth on the horizon.  Each new table meant a new shadow table which had to be maintained in parallel -- and whose creation and upgrade scripts had to be maintained across three database platforms.  A maintenance nightmare.\n\nThen there was me.  I had known about the problem for some time, of course -- I had done an estimate for fixing it -- but there was never time to fix it.  It was a big task, quite intrusive, and showing no easily-provable customer benefit.  Yes, I know ease of maintenance, by making life easier for developers, is an implicit customer benefit; but try selling that to management, when there are customers crying out for new features.\n\nBut in the project that was to introduce the fourth table (or seventh and eighth, you might say) I was in a position to say, \"we fix this first, or it all goes to hell\".\n\nThe user story was written.  I got my estimate out of hibernation (and increased it, of course).  And then I did the fix.  It was a great joy.  That in-memory caching mechanism I mentioned above?  I did that.   If I'd been designing it from scratch I would almost certainly have relied on JDBC's internal caching, at least until it proved problematic.

As soon as it was turned on, we noticed that taking certain actions, such as deleting a message, failed.\n\nThe failure was at a point in the code where the a value such as an amount was being retrieved from the <code>Map</code> that formed the new cache.  The failure was that the retrieved <code>Object</code> was being cast to a <code>Number</code>, but what was in the <code>Map</code> entry was actually a <code>String</code>.\n\nThis <code>Map</code> comes, by a fairly complex set of steps, from the new cache, and before that from the database itself, of course.\n\nNow, since the <code>Amount</code> column on the DB is numeric, and the <code>Map</code> in question is originally populated via Spring from the DB, obviously the value was a numeric one originally.

If memory serves it was a <code>String</code> where it should have been a <code>Date</code>.\n\nIt was clearly another result of the data being edited for display and updated in-place in the <code>Map</code>.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>That&rsquo;s hardcore in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->punk sense<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not rap, or anything else.  All genres have a &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo; subgenre, it seems.  I&rsquo;m sure that somewhere there&rsquo;s hardcore pop.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this album causes me to put together three words that I never thought I&rsquo;d see in the same sentence, never mind describing the same thing: punk rock opera.</p>\n<p>I know, I know, rock operas are the bloated detritus of prog rock, and part of what we fought the punk wars against.  Though truth be told, I&rsquo;ve always been quite fond of <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tommy<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  But in a sense it was always something that was going to happen eventually.  When a genre or a medium has been around for a while, people will try to take it further than it has gone before, and that&rsquo;s no bad thing.</p>\n<p>And when you get right down to it, it&rsquo;s all about storytelling, and who can complain about that?</p>\n<p>So I was pointed in the direction of this album by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a post on Mike Sizemore&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Sizemore is a scriptwriter; I probably started reading his blog when someone like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Warren Ellis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pointed me at a teaser or &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->sizzle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; video he and some other people made for a prospective science fiction series.</p>\n<p>Anyway, he posted a link to the video for the second track off the album, &lsquo;Queen of Hearts&rsquo;, and spoke very highly of it, as you&rsquo;ll have seen if you followed the link.  If you haven&rsquo;t, you should.  Go on, I&rsquo;ll wait.  I watched it a couple of times, and though, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK, interesting premise, I wish I could make out the words.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And then I forget about it for a while.</p>\n<p>But one day something made me go back.  I listened again.  I downloaded the album.  I fell in&hellip; not love, exactly, but fascination.</p>\n<p>North American hardcore bands have a certain vocal style, which is certainly not to everyone&rsquo;s taste.  In that way, I realised, it&rsquo;s not unlike actual opera.  Sure, the vocal stylings are about as far apart as possible; but they are both very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stylised<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  And my biggest two problems with opera are that it&rsquo;s hard to make the words out (even when they&rsquo;re singing in english), and that I don&rsquo;t really like the vocal stylings.</p>\n<p>Not to everyone&rsquo;s taste, as I said.</p>\n<p>Luckily, operas tend to have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->surtitles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; and albums have lyric sheets.  The lyrics for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Comes to Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->available on the web<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as you might expect.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m writing about this now because I haven&rsquo;t got round to doing so before, but especially because I&rsquo;ve just got back from seeing Fucked Up live.  They were playing at a Shoreditch venue called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XOYO<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a &ldquo;co-headliner&rdquo; with a band called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OFF!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I tweeted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a lot about it, and among other things, I expressed a degree of concern as to what it would be like going to a hardcore gig:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Hmm.

Here&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Queen of Hearts&rsquo; video, and it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever embedded a video.  Let&rsquo;s hope it works.  Note that this version has the kids in the video singing on it, which is not how it is on the album, but is very cool nonetheless.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And the second video from the album, &lsquo;The Other Shoe&rsquo;, which they also did tonight.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>For the last two months or so, it seems, I've been listening almost exclusively to a single album.[^fn1] That album is <a href=\"http://www.davidcomestolife.com/\"><cite>David Comes to Life</cite></a> by a Toronto hardcore band called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucked_Up\">Fucked Up</a>.\n\nThat's hardcore in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk\">punk sense</a>, not rap, or anything else.  All genres have a \"hardcore\" subgenre, it seems.  I'm sure that somewhere there's hardcore pop.\n\nAnyway, this album causes me to put together three words that I never thought I'd see in the same sentence, never mind describing the same thing: punk rock opera.\n\nI know, I know, rock operas are the bloated detritus of prog rock, and part of what we fought the punk wars against.  Though truth be told, I've always been quite fond of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(album)\"><cite>Tommy</cite></a>.  But in a sense it was always something that was going to happen eventually.  When a genre or a medium has been around for a while, people will try to take it further than it has gone before, and that's no bad thing.\n\nAnd when you get right down to it, it's all about storytelling, and who can complain about that?\n\nSo I was pointed in the direction of this album by <a href=\"http://www.sizemore.co.uk/2011/06/23/hello-my-name-is-david/\">a post on Mike Sizemore's blog</a>.  Sizemore is a scriptwriter; I probably started reading his blog when someone like <a href=\"http://www.warrenellis.com/\">Warren Ellis</a> pointed me at a teaser or \"<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/7963572\">sizzle</a>\" video he and some other people made for a prospective science fiction series.\n\nAnyway, he posted a link to the video for the second track off the album, 'Queen of Hearts', and spoke very highly of it, as you'll have seen if you followed the link.  If you haven't, you should.  Go on, I'll wait.  I watched it a couple of times, and though, \"That's OK, interesting premise, I wish I could make out the words.\"\n\nAnd then I forget about it for a while.\n\nBut one day something made me go back.  I listened again.  I downloaded the album.  I fell in... not love, exactly, but fascination.\n\nNorth American hardcore bands have a certain vocal style, which is certainly not to everyone's taste.  In that way, I realised, it's not unlike actual opera.  Sure, the vocal stylings are about as far apart as possible; but they are both very <em>stylised</em>.  And my biggest two problems with opera are that it's hard to make the words out (even when they're singing in english), and that I don't really like the vocal stylings.\n\nNot to everyone's taste, as I said.\n\nLuckily, operas tend to have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surtitles\">surtitles</a>; and albums have lyric sheets.  The lyrics for <cite>David Comes to Life</cite> are <a href=\"http://www.davidcomestolife.com/\">available on the web</a>, as you might expect.\n\nAnyway, I'm writing about this now because I haven't got round to doing so before, but especially because I've just got back from seeing Fucked Up live.  They were playing at a Shoreditch venue called <a href=\"http://www.xoyo.co.uk/\">XOYO</a> in a \"co-headliner\" with a band called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off!_%28band%29\">OFF!</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/devilgate\">I tweeted</a> a lot about it, and among other things, I expressed a degree of concern as to what it would be like going to a hardcore gig:\n\n<!-- http://twitter.com/devilgate/status/106636863355363330 --> <style type=\"text/css\">.bbpBox{background:url(http://a1.twimg.com/images/themes/theme5/bg.gif) #352726;padding:20px;}</style>\n\n</p><div id=\"tweet_106636863355363330\" class=\"bbpBox\" style=\"background:url(http://a1.twimg.com/images/themes/theme5/bg.gif) #352726;padding:20px;\"><p class=\"bbpTweet\" style=\"background:#fff;padding:10px 12px 10px 12px;margin:0;min-height:48px;color:#000;font-size:16px !important;line-height:22px;-moz-border-radius:5px;-webkit-border-radius:5px;\">Going to see Fucked Up and OFF! tonight.

Cameron tried to separate the ‚ÄúConservative No‚Äù campaign from the rest of the No campaign, while failing to condemn the outright lies told by the broader campaign.  It was a remarkable piece of squirming, and decidedly unconvincing.</p>\n<p>He then went on to use the ‚Äúone person one vote‚Äù argument.  This asserts that under AV, some people‚Äôs votes are counted more than once.  It ignores the fact that <em>every</em> voter can specify a list of preferences, of course, but it also seems to take an over-literal interpretation of the word ‚Äúcount‚Äù.  True, if my first preference is eliminated (under AV), my second preference is counted, which means that in some sense my ballot paper (or the entries on it) must be counted again; but ultimately the preferences I state are only applied towards one candidate.  My paper only ‚Äúcounts‚Äù towards one person.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, consider it a minor redefinition of what a ‚Äúvote‚Äù is.  Instead of meaning a single ‚ÄúX‚Äù placed in a single box, it means a set of one or more preferences specified on a ballot paper.  ‚ÄúOne person, one paper,‚Äù you could say.</p>\n<p>And last night I heard a ‚ÄúReferendum Broadcast‚Äù by the No campaign.  It was incredibly stupid, too; and again by being over-literal.  It analogised an AV-based election as a horse race, in which horse A came first, but the victory was awarded to third-placed horse C.  Everyone was very confused.  Because AV is so complex that nobody can understand it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/kk2lZ.jpg\">Here‚Äôs a picture</a> that shows the complexities of the two systems.</p>\n<p>Come on, say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù on Thursday.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I <em>kind of</em> enjoyed it, especially towards the end.  But in many ways I found it annoying, and I‚Äôve been trying to work out exactly why that is.</p>\n<p>Part of it is the characters, I think.  I don‚Äôt mind unsympathetic ‚Äî even unpleasant ‚Äî characters.  But I think the main problem with these ones is that it‚Äôs hard to tell their voices apart, and since the story is told from multiple first-person viewpoints, that‚Äôs a problem.</p>\n<p>But I think the biggest point of disconnection for me was technological: there is one particular item that made my disbelief-suspension system collapse in despair.</p>\n<p>Because I can easily believe in a near future where your phone takes the place of both credit cards and cash, where it is the heart and soul of your identity, and to be disconnected would make you an unperson.  But even supposing that phones could be engineered to give their owners a taser-like shock at the command of any police officer (what if your battery is low?); even supposing that a society would not rise up in protest at the madness of a government requiring its citizens to possess such a thing; and even supposing that it all worked: I <em>can‚Äôt</em> believe that nobody would carry them in thick rubber pockets.</p>\n<p>So in the end, in a novel containing much about political activism, it‚Äôs the political acquiescence of its imagined society that crashed me out of the story too often.</p>\n<p>Still, it was her first novel, and shows much promise, so I expect that <cite>Zoo City</cite> will be a worthy winner.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

So to read this, from the wordprocessor of the Tories (and LibDems) is remarkable:\n\n<ul>\n<li>A Freedom or Great Repeal Bill.</li>\n<li><p>The scrapping of ID card scheme, the National Identity register, the next generation of biometric passports and the Contact Point Database.</p></li>\n<li><p>Outlawing the fingerprinting of children at school without parental permission.</p></li>\n<li><p>The extension of the scope of the Freedom of Information Act to provide greater transparency.</p></li>\n<li><p>Adopting the protections of the Scottish model for the DNA database.</p></li>\n<li><p>The protection of historic freedoms through the defence of trial by jury.</p></li>\n<li><p>The restoration of rights to non-violent protest.</p></li>\n<li><p>The review of libel laws to protect freedom of speech.</p></li>\n<li><p>Safeguards against the misuse of anti-terrorism legislation.</p></li>\n<li><p>Further regulation of CCTV.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ending of storage of internet and email records without good reason.</p></li>\n<li><p>A new mechanism to prevent the proliferation of unnecessary new criminal offences.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I mean, that's pretty much everything we could want on civil liberties, right there.\n\nAnd a few other points are good.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>The new Iain Banks book, <cite>Transition</cite>, is a science fiction novel. This is despite the fact that it is not published as by Iain <em>M</em> Banks.\n\nAnd I don't mean the slightly-ambiguous, could-be-a-dream-or-somebody's-madness-if-you-don't-want-to-suspend-your-disbelief sort of thing you get in <cite>The Bridge</cite> Or <cite>Walking On Glass</cite>, either.  This is out-and-out SF, no  queries or discussion.  It is a tale of parallel universes, of an infinity of alternative Earths, and of people who can move between them, using a combination of drugs and native ability.\n\nAnd it's that ability that holds both one of the novel's unanswered moral questions, and its biggest flaw.\n\nWhen adepts transition between the worlds, they do so in mind only.  That is, their mind occupies - possesses - the body of someone who already exists on the target parallel.\n\nEthically, this is a minefield, of course.  But that question is only vaguely touched on.\n\nOther ethical issues are addressed, notably the use of torture by states.  There is passing character - just a walk-on, really - of a policeman who once tortured a terrorist suspect and had some success.  He was tortured in turn by his guilt for the rest of his life.\n\nThe big flaw, though, concerns the transition mechanism and its use, and to talk about it, I'll have to include some minor spoilers.  So, you know: you have been warned.\n\nAs I said, flitting between the parallel universes involves the mind, the personality of the transitionary jumping into the body of someone already existing on the target parallel.  This applies even when someone takes a 'passenger' along, which some can do.  Each of them takes over a body in the new world.\n\nBut sometimes Banks has characters jumping to places where there really <em>couldn't</em> be a body for them to take over (versions of the Earth that are uninhabited, for example).  Yet they seem to jump successfully.\n\nI don't mind there being a 'bodiless' and a 'bodiful' version of the ability, for example: but it does need to be explained, or at least mentioned.  I can hardly believe that nobody picked this up in the revision and editing process.\n\nThat aside, though, it's damn fine, and probably his best 'non-M' for quite a few years.\n\nWith the secret cabal that is trying to run the world(s) behind the scenes, it is sort of <cite>The Business 2.0</cite>.  Or maybe 10.0.</p></body></html>\n",

				"title": "Identity and letdown in The Raw Shark Texts, by Steven Hall (books 2008, 6)",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>He is attacked by a &lsquo;conceptual shark&rsquo;: a living, sentient creature that is composed of ideas, of thoughts, of words; and that swims in the sea of information that surrounds us.  This is the creature that took his memories.  It eats such information, and fixates on a victim, and will keep coming back to attack them again and again.</p>\n<p>So the messages from &ldquo;the first Eric Sanderson&rdquo; tell him.  Fortunately they also give him some tools and techniques to protect himself, and information about someone who might be able to help him.</p>\n<p>So eventually he sets out on a quest to find the mysterious Trey Fidorous.  That&rsquo;s as far as I&rsquo;m going to go with the plot summary (it covers probably a quarter of the book).</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting idea, that creatures composed of pure information, of ideas, can exist and can do us harm.  We&rsquo;re well into SF territory here, without wanting to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hegemonise<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and irrespective of the fact that it&rsquo;s marketed as mainstream literary fiction (why, I&rsquo;ve often wondered, don&rsquo;t people talk about &ldquo;li-fi&rdquo;, or &ldquo;cri-fi&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;hi-fi&rdquo;?  Why is SF so special that it gets its own disparaging abbreviation?)  There was real justification for including this work in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clarke Awards shortlist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (sadly I haven&rsquo;t read any of the others on the list).  We are plunged into a world of infinite strangeness and difference (even though it stands alongside the world we are familiar with).  We have to hang on for the ride and pick things up as we go along.  These are standard, recognised characteristics of much SF.</p>\n<p>Which may be neither here nor there, really; unless how we classify a work affects how we approach it, how we read it.  And I think it&rsquo;s true that it does: if you approach Iain Banks&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bridge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for example, as SF (it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;non-M&rsquo;, so it was marketed as mainstream), then you&rsquo;ll get quite a different effect from the scenes on the bridge, and with the barbarian; at least allowing for the possibility that those events actually happened in some sense, in some reality.  As opposed to the assumption that they were &lsquo;only&rsquo; the deranged fantasy of a mind in a coma, which is of course the only &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; reading.</p>\n<p>We are in a similar situation here.  Eric&rsquo;s psychiatrist thinks that he might be going into a fugue state; and clearly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has happened to his mind.  But Eric has experienced the attack of the Ludovician (the name of the particular type of conceptual fish that attacked him) and he believes throughout that what is happening is real.  And all through the quest, and the love story and the fight scenes, he believes it.  And so does the author, apparently.</p>\n<p>And so do we.</p>\n<p>Except.</p>\n<p>Except, except.</p>\n<p>Right on the second last page, Hall undermines it all.  After the narrative has finished there are a couple of pages of extra material before the &lsquo;undex&rsquo; (the point of which I&rsquo;m not sure about).</p>\n<p>The first of these pulls the rug out from under us, and dumps us more or less into &ldquo;he woke up and it was all a dream&rdquo; territory.  Or didn&rsquo;t wake up.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Eric Sanderson wakes without his memories.  In short order he starts receiving messages apparently sent by his former self, is told by his psychiatrist not to read any such messages, and starts reading them - in the wrong order, which leaves him unready for the trouble that is about to assail him.\n\nHe is attacked by a 'conceptual shark': a living, sentient creature that is composed of ideas, of thoughts, of words; and that swims in the sea of information that surrounds us.  This is the creature that took his memories.  It eats such information, and fixates on a victim, and will keep coming back to attack them again and again.\n\nSo the messages from \"the first Eric Sanderson\" tell him.  Fortunately they also give him some tools and techniques to protect himself, and information about someone who might be able to help him.\n\nSo eventually he sets out on a quest to find the mysterious Trey Fidorous.  That's as far as I'm going to go with the plot summary (it covers probably a quarter of the book).\n\nIt's an interesting idea, that creatures composed of pure information, of ideas, can exist and can do us harm.  We're well into SF territory here, without wanting to <a href=\"http://www.chrononaut.org/log/?p=295\">hegemonise</a>, and irrespective of the fact that it's marketed as mainstream literary fiction (why, I've often wondered, don't people talk about \"li-fi\", or \"cri-fi\", or even \"hi-fi\"?  Why is SF so special that it gets its own disparaging abbreviation?)  There was real justification for including this work in the <a href=\"http://www.clarkeaward.com/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=1%3Alatest-news&amp;id=79%3A2008+Shortlist+Announced&amp;tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;page=&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=50\">Clarke Awards shortlist</a> (sadly I haven't read any of the others on the list).  We are plunged into a world of infinite strangeness and difference (even though it stands alongside the world we are familiar with).  We have to hang on for the ride and pick things up as we go along.  These are standard, recognised characteristics of much SF.\n\nWhich may be neither here nor there, really; unless how we classify a work affects how we approach it, how we read it.  And I think it's true that it does: if you approach Iain Banks's <cite>The Bridge</cite>, for example, as SF (it's a 'non-M', so it was marketed as mainstream), then you'll get quite a different effect from the scenes on the bridge, and with the barbarian; at least allowing for the possibility that those events actually happened in some sense, in some reality.  As opposed to the assumption that they were 'only' the deranged fantasy of a mind in a coma, which is of course the only 'mainstream' reading.\n\nWe are in a similar situation here.  Eric's psychiatrist thinks that he might be going into a fugue state; and clearly <em>something</em> has happened to his mind.  But Eric has experienced the attack of the Ludovician (the name of the particular type of conceptual fish that attacked him) and he believes throughout that what is happening is real.  And all through the quest, and the love story and the fight scenes, he believes it.  And so does the author, apparently.\n\nAnd so do we.\n\nExcept.\n\nExcept, except.\n\nRight on the second last page, Hall undermines it all.  After the narrative has finished there are a couple of pages of extra material before the 'undex' (the point of which I'm not sure about).\n\nThe first of these pulls the rug out from under us, and dumps us more or less into \"he woke up and it was all a dream\" territory.  Or didn't wake up.  It's a bit like Sam Tyler at the  end of <cite>Life on Mars</cite>, except there it was more or less clearly stated all the way through that he was in a coma: you just didn't want it to be so.\n\nThe present work is less honest, in a way, since there really is no suggestion that what Eric is experiencing might not be 'real'.  Sure, it's always there as a possibility, but I'd have to say,\"What's the point?\", really.  Why would you bother to write a story that, in the internal logic of that story, all took place in the head of its protagonist, <em>and didn't do anything to help the protagonist</em>, or illuminate his life, or help him to come to terms with something?\n\nAs such, this is ultimately disappointing: it's a great ride, spoiled by the ending.\n\nAlthough, a further twist occurs to me, a couple of months after reading it.  If the rug-pulling element were <em>not</em> there, you could say, then we would have a fantasy-happy ending, like the fake ending in <cite>Brazil</cite>.  That's never a good thing, of course, but the difference remains this: in <cite>Brazil</cite>, the false ending was tacked on (or it would have been if the 'real' ending hadn't superseded it).  Here, the ending grows naturally out of all that has gone before.  If everything was in his imagination, then fine, so was the ending.

So I can only reiterate: get out and vote, and stop Boris.  Give at least your _second_ vote to Ken.  He has his faults, but he's done a pretty good job of running the city this last eight years.\n\nVote!\n\n</p></body></html>\n",

This applies in particular to the new academies.  Our closest, non-denominational, mixed-gender, state secondary, is Mossbourne, the much-cited flagship of the government&rsquo;s new academies programme.

Not a pass -or-fail test, of course: this is still a comprehensive school, so there&rsquo;s no selection by ability allowed.  Rather, this test is used to split the kids into ability bands.  The entry conditions then ensure that an equal proportion of kids from each band is offered a place.  This is to ensure that the school  has kids of a range of abilities; to ensure that it is truly comprehensive, if you will.</p>\n<p>None of that is inherently bad: a school can&rsquo;t take every kid, if more want in than it has places, so it has to have some conditions by which to decide which ones to take.

Well, across Hackney as a whole, but we happen to be in one of the more problematic corners, since we&rsquo;re right at the edge of the borough.  That wouldn&rsquo;t matter if the Hackney schools gave priority to Hackney kids, but they don&rsquo;t: their distance criteria are based on pure straight-line measurements, ignoring borough boundaries.</p>\n<p>Again, <em>that</em> wouldn&rsquo;t matter so much if all the other boroughs did the same.  But they don&rsquo;t.  Our neighbours Tower Hamlets, for example, not only give priority to Tower Hamlets residents, they also have tied primary schools.  If your kid goes to one of these, then they are <em>guaranteed</em> a place in the associated secondary school, if they (you) want it.</p>\n<p>But this is not intended to be a big bowl of sour grapes.  Our boy almost certainly won&rsquo;t get into any of the Hackney schools, but he should get into the next-nearest one, which is just over the border into Waltham Forest.  And all of this may be moot, anyway.  But more of that later.</p>\n<p>I referred in my title to &ldquo;the myth of choice&rdquo;, and I was careful to stress above that the application process allows parents and children to specify their <em>preferences</em>, rather than choices.  That&rsquo;s because of what happens next, after the application process has come up with a school for your kid.</p>\n<p>You get an offer.  One offer.  That&rsquo;s it.  (Or maybe none, in which you have to run around frantically making further applications.)</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not like it was when I applied to university (and probably still is for university applications today).  There, you could apply to five (or was it six?) institutions using the UCCA (now UCAS) form.  They all assessed your application, and up to <em>all</em> of them made you an offer.  You could then choose among your offers and decide  which place would suit you best.</p>\n<p>That was choice.  For secondary schools. despite what the government might tell you, there is no choice.  All you can do is state your preferences.</p>\n<p>Our particular dilemma had another wrinkle, though.</p>\n<p>See, he and some of his friends decided that they wanted to go to something called The Latymer School, in Edmonton.  I was surprised when I found out that this is a grammar school.  Now, some years ago I was surprised to discover that these things still exist in England.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that when the comprehensive system started in Scotland, it was done properly: we got rid of <em>all</em> the grammar schools and Secondary Moderns, as far as I understand it.  So as I say, it was a surprise when I realised they still had some in England.</p>\n<p>But even then, I thought they were restricted to Kent and a few other places.  I had no idea there were any in London.</p>\n<p>Still, there we were.  We weren&rsquo;t about to forbid him to look at a particular school, despite our natural left-wing reaction to the idea of a selective school.  Perhaps of more concern is that he would be going out of the borough, with both a long journey to get there, and a less ethnically diverse mix than he&rsquo;s used to from primary.</p>\n<p>When it came time to stating our preferences, we let him have the final word.  Which is a lot of weight to put on the shoulders of a ten-year-old, perhaps, but it&rsquo;s better than pressuring him into going somewhere he&rsquo;d rather not go, and driving him away from us.</p>\n<p>One thing I can say: selection by ability is obviously better than selection by ability to pay.</p>\n<p>And another: we&rsquo;ll be incredibly proud of him wherever he goes.</p>\n<p>He got through the first battery of tests, and took the second; and we&rsquo;ve been waiting since then.  And tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll know.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

That's because of what happens next, after the application process has come up with a school for your kid.\n\nYou get an offer.  One offer.  That's it.  (Or maybe none, in which you have to run around frantically making further applications.)\n\nIt's not like it was when I applied to university (and probably still is for university applications today).  There, you could apply to five (or was it six?) institutions using the UCCA (now UCAS) form.  They all assessed your application, and up to _all_ of them made you an offer.  You could then choose among your offers and decide  which place would suit you best.\n\nThat was choice.  For secondary schools. despite what the government might tell you, there is no choice.  All you can do is state your preferences.\n\nOur particular dilemma had another wrinkle, though.\n\nSee, he and some of his friends decided that they wanted to go to something called The Latymer School, in Edmonton.  I was surprised when I found out that this is a grammar school.  Now, some years ago I was surprised to discover that these things still exist in England.  I'm pretty sure that when the comprehensive system started in Scotland, it was done properly: we got rid of _all_ the grammar schools and Secondary Moderns, as far as I understand it.  So as I say, it was a surprise when I realised they still had some in England.\n\nBut even then, I thought they were restricted to Kent and a few other places.  I had no idea there were any in London.\n\nStill, there we were.  We weren't about to forbid him to look at a particular school, despite our natural left-wing reaction to the idea of a selective school.  Perhaps of more concern is that he would be going out of the borough, with both a long journey to get there, and a less ethnically diverse mix than he's used to from primary.\n\nWhen it came time to stating our preferences, we let him have the final word.  Which is a lot of weight to put on the shoulders of a ten-year-old, perhaps, but it's better than pressuring him into going somewhere he'd rather not go, and driving him away from us.\n\nOne thing I can say: selection by ability is obviously better than selection by ability to pay.\n\nAnd another: we'll be incredibly proud of him wherever he goes.\n\nHe got through the first battery of tests, and took the second; and we've been waiting since then.  And tomorrow, we'll know.\n\n</body></html>\n",

It was published in 1977, when I was 12 or 13.  So I expect I missed it because I was &lsquo;too old&rsquo; for children&rsquo;s books, and not yet old enough again for them.

All that I recalled was a complaint to the effect that in the book, the girl was supposed to be plain, even boyish-looking, while in the film she was Hollywood-pretty (if dressed a little unconventionally compared to her schoolmates).</p>\n<p>I think that review explains why my opinion of the film differs so significantly from that of most reviewers: they all seem to have read the book.  Inevitably they review the film in comparison to it, and fuelled by their knowledge of the plot.</p>\n<p>So they can describe it as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lsquo;bittersweet&rsquo;, as having an &lsquo;uplifting&rsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ending; even as &lsquo;transcendent&rsquo; (I think that last came from one of the mini-documentaries on the DVD).

The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Potters<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can get away with it, because so many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> read the books first.  But in general a film &ndash; or any adaptation from one medium to another &ndash; must work on its own.  It is a separate, new creation, and has to stand or fall as such.</p>\n<p>In one sense at least, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Terabithia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fails on this account.</p>\n<p>The trouble is not lack of coherence; rather it is excess of impact, and lack of recovery time.  There is certainly some foreshadowing: it is plain that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bad is going to happen.  But the  tragedy when it comes &ndash; and make no mistake, the story <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a tragedy &ndash; is too deep, too dark, too sudden.  Yes, true, that&rsquo;s how it would be in real life; and I&rsquo;m not suggesting that movie viewers, including children, should be completely protected from darkness, tragedy or loss.  But here, suddenly, shatteringly, we are no longer watching the film that we thought we were.</p>\n<p>Which is not necessarily a bad thing.  But the film&rsquo;s fatal flaw &ndash; or at least the cause of its failure to achieve the uplift suggested by reviewers &ndash; comes after the plunge into darkness.</p>\n<p>It is the lack of recovery time, and the content of what time there is.  Yes, a significant amount of time for the characters is compressed into a few swiftly-edited scenes.  Perhaps enough time is represented for the boy, Jess, to come to terms with his loss, or at least to begin to do so.  But it is not enough time for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do so.</p>\n<p>And perhaps because the fantasy elements were (rightly) understated earlier on, we have what feels like a tacked-on fantasy ending.  And it&rsquo;s not even the tacked-on fantasy ending we might want.  Me, I&rsquo;d have liked Jess, the talented artist, to to have ripped out the page of the film&rsquo;s continuity, said, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and sketched a new one.</p>\n<p>That, of course, would have made for a saccharine ending, like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->false ending<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brazil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or the original cut of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blade Runner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It would have been deemed a mistake (not least because of differing from the book), or at least have been very hard to make work.  It would have betrayed the story.</p>\n<p>But the ending that we do have betrays the story too, I think, in a different way.  The descent (ascent?) into fantasy may show that Jess had become closer to his little sister; but it writes Leslie out of his memories of Terabithia.  It ceases to be their magical place, and therefore fails to honour her memory.</p>\n<p>Of course it is all to help him to come to terms with his loss; but as his Dad tells him, it&rsquo;s by remembering what was special about her that he can keep her alive.</p>\n<p>Above all, though, it all happens too quickly: maybe we, the viewers, could have had just a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->little<!-- raw HTML omitted --> more time?</p>\n<p>I can only assume that the book does, in fact, provide a more gentle exit for its readers, for it to be so popular.  Though of course, you can take a book at your own pace.</p>\n<p>Yet despite &ndash; or more likely, because of &ndash; all of the above, it&rsquo;s a film that will stay with me for a long time; that I&rsquo;ll probably watch again; and whose source-book I&rsquo;ll certainly seek out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

Me, I'd have liked Jess, the talented artist, to to have ripped out the page of the film's continuity, said, \"No!\" and sketched a new one.\n\nThat, of course, would have made for a saccharine ending, like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_(film)#Scenes_missing_in_American_cut\">false ending</a> in <cite>Brazil</cite>, or the original cut of <cite>Blade Runner</cite>.  It would have been deemed a mistake (not least because of differing from the book), or at least have been very hard to make work.  It would have betrayed the story.\n\nBut the ending that we do have betrays the story too, I think, in a different way.  The descent (ascent?) into fantasy may show that Jess had become closer to his little sister; but it writes Leslie out of his memories of Terabithia.  It ceases to be their magical place, and therefore fails to honour her memory.\n\nOf course it is all to help him to come to terms with his loss; but as his Dad tells him, it's by remembering what was special about her that he can keep her alive.\n\nAbove all, though, it all happens too quickly: maybe we, the viewers, could have had just a <em>little</em> more time?\n\nI can only assume that the book does, in fact, provide a more gentle exit for its readers, for it to be so popular.  Though of course, you can take a book at your own pace.\n\nYet despite -- or more likely, because of -- all of the above, it's a film that will stay with me for a long time; that I'll probably watch again; and whose source-book I'll certainly seek out.</p></body></html>\n",

Blogging doesn‚Äôt <em>have</em> to be completely reactive.  Sometimes it should take the longer-term, contemplative view.  So I offer this.</p>\n<p>It seems obvious to me that, if your navy personnel are captured by the forces of a foreign power, in peacetime, and accused of being in the foreign power‚Äôs waters, then what you should do is as follows:<br>\nYou say, ‚ÄúOops, sorry.  Didn‚Äôt mean to have them off station; didn‚Äôt think they were, actually, but if they were, we‚Äôre sorry.‚Äù  Even, and let me make this quite clear, if you know <em>perfectly well</em> that they weren‚Äôt in the other power‚Äôs territory.</p>\n<p>That, it seems to me, would be the <em>diplomatic</em> thing to do</p>\n<p>So why did they not do that?  My best guess is that they ‚Äì the British government ‚Äì were worried about losing face.</p>\n<p>‚ÄòLosing face.‚Äô  It‚Äôs a strange thing for the government of what is still a fairly major world power to be worrying about, isn‚Äôt it?  After all, it‚Äôs not as if making such a guarded admission and apology would actually have done Britain any harm, would it?</p>\n<p>And it might have got the captured service people home a few days earlier ‚Äì and without being humiliated on TV ‚Äì you never know.  Perhaps, even, the Iranian government would have apologised in their turn, and admitted that <em>they</em> might have made a mistake.</p>\n<p>That last seems almost likely, given that they did appear to concede quite graciously in the end.  But what do I know?  I‚Äôm neither diplomat nor politician, and there might be some way in which doing what I suggested right from the start would have been political suicide.  And obviously things will have been going on in the background of which we know nothing.  But still‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>And then they get home and tell their stories.  I seem to be the only person in the country who thinks like this, but I see no reason why they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to profit from doing so.  <em>Somebody</em> is going to profit from the stories being told, so why shouldn‚Äôt it be the ones to whom they happened?</p>\n<p>Sure, if it‚Äôs against the rules of the service, then that‚Äôs the deal they signed up for.  But since the Ministry of Defence authorised it, then at the very least, I  don‚Äôt see how you can blame the sailors.</p>\n<p>I speak as someone who likes to write; so if I imagine myself into a situation like that, I know I would want to write my story once I had escaped.  And if I could go on to sell it for professional publication, then you‚Äôre damn right I would want to do so.

It doesn't do to go around having lots of unfinished pieces (and I speak as someone who has a great many unfinished things lying around, of one variety or another).\n\nWhen I do finish it, I'll probably put it online. Now my question is, does such a work now count as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction?\">fanfic</a> I suppose it does, on some level. Curious, because the winner of the competition gets professionally published, and that obviously <em>isn't</em> fan fiction.\n\nStill on a literary note, my friend <a href=\"http://www.writers-bloc.org.uk/comrades/\">Andrew</a> was in town the other night, because he was one of the authors who was doing a reading that was organised by <a href=\"http://www.farthingmagazine.com/\">Farthing magazine</a>. Until Andrew told me about the event, I didn't even know that the publication existed.\n\nIt was a good night. I missed the first reading, by Anna Feruglio Dal Dan, but heard various drabbles, Andrew's story, and two other fine stories.\n\nDuring the interval I picked up the back issues of the magazine and took out a subscription. Then at the end we helped the Editor, <a href=\"http://www.wendybradley.com/\">Wendy Bradley</a>, to carry some boxes back to her flat, and drank her whisky.\n\nAll in all, it was a fine night.</p></body></html>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But in the end it wasn&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bad.  The queue began moving fairly quickly &ndash; or smoothly, at least &ndash; and while it was frustrating, it was bearable, as long as you didn&rsquo;t let yourself <!-- raw HTML omitted -->get<!-- raw HTML omitted --> frustrated.  The passport/boarding-pass-control desk looked a right mess, though, covered as it was by abandoned bottles, cosmetics containers and what have you.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m not actually sure why the queues were so long.  The only things that have changed in security terms compared with a few months ago are the prohibited items in hand baggage, and the enforcement of the &ldquo;only one item&rdquo; rule (I&rsquo;m sure this has been the rule for decades, but it just wasn&rsquo;t strictly enforced).  Both of those issues should be dealt with at checkin, so when you get to the security gates you should be ready.  Every bag and coat is x-rayed, as before: but there should be fewer bags; everyone goes through a metal detector, just as they always did.  There was a &ldquo;please take off your shoes&rdquo; section after the metal detectors, but as we paused at it, one security guy called, &ldquo;Not everybody, not everybody,&rdquo; and waved us on.  I suppose people were randomly chosen, and incidentally, everyone I saw taking their shoes off was white.  This may, of course, just mean that people who look like terrorists (whatever that may mean) are not travelling, from fear of being hassled.</p>\n<p>I conclude that the only reason for the giant queues must be stupidity: there must be people who, even though they are asked about prohibited items at checkin, and even though this stuff has been in the news for weeks, still have drinks in their hand luggage, and then have to stop to abandon them at security.  Or who try to take more than one item on, even though they&rsquo;ve been told not to.  And yet, I didn&rsquo;t see much of that happening.  I really don&rsquo;t understand why the queues got so big.  There were plenty of security staff on duty, too.</p>\n<p>Coming back, things were much less fraught at Glasgow Airport, as they generally are at smaller airports, in my experience.</p>\n<p>Throughout, I have to say, all the security staff we encountered were cheerful, polite, and helpful, while doing a largely thankless, probably quite dull, job, filled with seemingly-arbitrary rule changes handed down from above.  I can&rsquo;t really fault them, no matter how daft some of the things they have to enforce may be.</p>\n<p>A last thought: we are being conditioned to accept travelling with photo ID, even within the country.  It was strange to see everyone queuing up to get onto a flight to Scotland, with their passports ready.  Now I&rsquo;d be quite happy to see EU passports issued by the Republic of Scotland (as long as it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a republic), but for now, it was still a journey within the UK.</p>\n<p>And the strange thing is, it seems to be the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->airlines<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are driving this, not the authorities.  I have had to show photo ID on RyanAir and EasyJet, but a few months ago &ndash; this year, certainly &ndash; I flew to Scotland with BMI Baby, and not only did they not ask for ID, but I didn&rsquo;t even have to see a human to check in: hand baggage, a credit card, and a self-checkin machine, and there I was.  That was before all the recent fuss, true, but RyanAir (and possibly EasyJet) have been asking for ID for years.  Are they secretly being used by the government to get us used to carrying ID cards?  And if so, why is it only some airlines?</p>\n<p>Or am I being unreasonably paranoid?  &lsquo;Cos I only want to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reasonably<!-- raw HTML omitted --> paranoid, you know.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

Although we made EasyJet's last checkin time with a good ten minutes to spare, I really thought we would miss our flight when we joined the back of one of two or three giant, slow-moving queues.

We weren't alone in this error, though: the queues mingled, and quite a few others had made the same mistake.\n\nBut in the end it wasn't <em>that</em> bad.  The queue began moving fairly quickly -- or smoothly, at least -- and while it was frustrating, it was bearable, as long as you didn't let yourself <em>get</em> frustrated.  The passport/boarding-pass-control desk looked a right mess, though, covered as it was by abandoned bottles, cosmetics containers and what have you.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not actually sure why the queues were so long.  The only things that have changed in security terms compared with a few months ago are the prohibited items in hand baggage, and the enforcement of the \"only one item\" rule (I'm sure this has been the rule for decades, but it just wasn't strictly enforced).  Both of those issues should be dealt with at checkin, so when you get to the security gates you should be ready.  Every bag and coat is x-rayed, as before: but there should be fewer bags; everyone goes through a metal detector, just as they always did.  There was a \"please take off your shoes\" section after the metal detectors, but as we paused at it, one security guy called, \"Not everybody, not everybody,\" and waved us on.  I suppose people were randomly chosen, and incidentally, everyone I saw taking their shoes off was white.  This may, of course, just mean that people who look like terrorists (whatever that may mean) are not travelling, from fear of being hassled.\n\nI conclude that the only reason for the giant queues must be stupidity: there must be people who, even though they are asked about prohibited items at checkin, and even though this stuff has been in the news for weeks, still have drinks in their hand luggage, and then have to stop to abandon them at security.  Or who try to take more than one item on, even though they've been told not to.  And yet, I didn't see much of that happening.  I really don't understand why the queues got so big.  There were plenty of security staff on duty, too.\n\nComing back, things were much less fraught at Glasgow Airport, as they generally are at smaller airports, in my experience.\n\nThroughout, I have to say, all the security staff we encountered were cheerful, polite, and helpful, while doing a largely thankless, probably quite dull, job, filled with seemingly-arbitrary rule changes handed down from above.  I can't really fault them, no matter how daft some of the things they have to enforce may be.\n\nA last thought: we are being conditioned to accept travelling with photo ID, even within the country.  It was strange to see everyone queuing up to get onto a flight to Scotland, with their passports ready.  Now I'd be quite happy to see EU passports issued by the Republic of Scotland (as long as it <em>was</em> a republic), but for now, it was still a journey within the UK.\n\nAnd the strange thing is, it seems to be the <em>airlines</em> that are driving this, not the authorities.  I have had to show photo ID on RyanAir and EasyJet, but a few months ago -- this year, certainly -- I flew to Scotland with BMI Baby, and not only did they not ask for ID, but I didn't even have to see a human to check in: hand baggage, a credit card, and a self-checkin machine, and there I was.  That was before all the recent fuss, true, but RyanAir (and possibly EasyJet) have been asking for ID for years.  Are they secretly being used by the government to get us used to carrying ID cards?  And if so, why is it only some airlines?\n\nOr am I being unreasonably paranoid?  'Cos I only want to be <em>reasonably</em> paranoid, you know.</p></body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><h5>This Knife of Sheffield Steel</h5>\n<p>When you grow up in Scotland (or at least, when I did so during the sixties and seventies) you pick up a fair amount of anti-English feeling.  It‚Äôs mainly to do with football, but it is linked to what is seen as several hundred years of oppression.  Although the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Union_1707\">Act of Union</a> was, in theory, a mutual act between two independent nations, it is clear which was the dominant partner.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve lived in England ‚Äî in London ‚Äî for nineteen years, though, and am unlikely to leave (or not to go back to Scotland at any rate: if I left London it would be to escape the UK‚Äôs ubiquitous surveillance state  and paranoid anti-terror laws).  It should be obvious, then, that I harbour no great dislike of England or its people.  Indeed, to harbour such a collective dislike for fifty-odd million would be bigotry of the most ludicrous sort.</p>\n<p>However, I have long been bothered by the apparent inability of many English people to distinguish their country‚Äôs identifying features from those of the larger nation-state of which it is part.  And I‚Äôm further disappointed by what seems to be a similar difficulty that many of Dave‚Äôs <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/temperama/big_england/index.html\">Big England</a> guests have had: finding things to love that are uniquely and explicitly English.</p>\n<p>As I discussed with <a href=\"http://lightandbitter.blogspot.com/\">Roldy</a> on <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/temperama/2006/08/big_england_no2.html\">his Big England piece</a>, so many of the the things that people have chosen are not English ‚Äî not uniquely so, at least.  Though many of them are uniquely British.</p>\n<h5>On A Catwalk Jungle</h5>\n<p>John Lennon was sadly mistaken when he sang ‚ÄúThe English army had just won the war‚Äù ‚Äî and not just because he was ignoring the contributions of Canadians, Poles, the Free French, and of course, the USA.</p>\n<p>That is poetic licence,  and it would be churlish of me to complain.  But it is perhaps the most famous example of the casual use of ‚ÄúEngland‚Äù, when the speaker or writer really means one or other of ‚ÄúGreat Britain‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe United Kingdom‚Äù, or even ‚ÄúThe British Isles‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Some would say that it doesn‚Äôt matter.  However, I believe it is always worth taking care with language, to try to say precisely what you mean: how else are others to understand you?  Also, it‚Äôs bloody annoying to us Scots (and probably to the Welsh and Northern Irish, too).  Maybe that‚Äôs why they do it, of course.</p>\n<h5>Where the Well-known Flag of England Flies</h5>\n<p>It used to be that the English also seemed confused about which country they meant at football matches.  All through my childhood and well into my twenties I wondered why English football fans supported their country using an emblem that contained representations of two other countries as well as their own.  I‚Äôm speaking of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Flag\">Union Flag</a>, of course.  Stadiums used to be draped in it, even when England were playing Scotland in the old Home Internationals (just as an aside: can you think of another country which has such a tautologically-named event?)</p>\n<p>What did they think the blue part with the white cross represented, I used to wonder?</p>\n<p>In recent years, though, football fans at least seem to have worked out which country‚Äôs flag they want to fly.  Which brings us back to why Dave started this whole thing.</p>\n<h5>Land of One Thousand Stances</h5>\n<p>I guess I like England; but it took me a long time to realise that I don‚Äôt have to like it in <em>opposition</em> to anything, particularly Scotland: I can (and do) love London, and still love Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>London is something of a special case, though.  While it is undoubtedly <em>in</em> England, there is a sense in which it is not <em>of</em> it: it is not really part of England, or of any country.  Perhaps all great ‚Äúworld cities‚Äù are like that.  The old song goes, ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a Londoner,‚Äù not, ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm English and London is the capital city of my country‚Äù.</p>\n<p>So where does all that leave me?  In a word, I think, ambivalent.  All the things that I might list that I like about this country, I don‚Äôt see as uniquely English (except by geography), but rather as British: music, literature, scenery, beer, the BBC‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Maybe the thing to do is turn it on its head.  While I would claim  The Beatles or The Clash as ‚ÄúBritish bands‚Äù, rather than ‚ÄúEnglish bands‚Äù, I would claim Iain Banks or Irving Welsh, say, as ‚ÄúScottish writers‚Äù.  So maybe I‚Äôm being unfair to England.</p>\n<p>But then, I‚Äôm in the oppressed minority.</p>\n<p>And cricket‚Äôs still the most boring thing imaginable.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Well, Saturday the 1st of July, 2006 will go down in my personal history as something of a special day. First I manage to end up actually feeling sorry for the England football team (except for the idiot Wayne Rooney) ‚Äî or more for their supporters, really, in the form of my kids.  Then Russell T Davies and the BBC give us the glory that is ‚Äò<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2006/armyofghosts.shtml\">Army of Ghosts</a>‚Äô.  Warning: spoilers follow.<br>\n<!--more--><br>\n<a id=\"more-38\"></a><br>\nAt last.  At long, long last, Daleks and Cybermen together (and doubtless against each other).  I remember long ago in my university days, my friend Andrew (who co-edited <cite><a href=\"http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/misc/novascotia.htm\">Nova Scotia</a></cite>, as I was <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=36\">saying the other day</a>) putting forth the proposition that there should be a Dalek-Cyber war.  It being inevitable that two races each so destructive and inimical to other life forms, should fight if they ever met.</p>\n<p>And maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to get them out of this one: somehow or other the Doctor‚Äôs going to have to use one set of baddies against the other.</p>\n<p>But what of Rose?  How can she be saying,‚ÄùThis is how I died‚Äù?  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she got trapped on the alternative Earth, but that‚Äôs not exactly death.  Could she end up trapped in the Void craft (and in the Void)?  The beach at the beginning could be virtual reality.  But even that wouldn‚Äôt exactly be death, and it couldn‚Äôt provide any way that she could be telling her story.</p>\n<p>The only thing that could make anything like sense, as far as I can see, is if she was telling her story knowing that she was about to die.  But I don‚Äôt really see how they could get to that state of affairs in the forty-five minutes remaining of the series.</p>\n<p>Still, all this speculation will look pretty stupid by this time next week, I suppose, as the <a href=\"http://forum.digitalspy.co.uk/board/showthread.php?t=408175\">speculation about ‚ÄúArmy of Ghosts‚Äù</a> does now.</p>\n<p>My son was <em>crying</em> with emotion  when the Daleks flew out of the sphere.  We had, of course, seen the Dalek blast in the trailer, and he had said,‚ÄùI think there‚Äôll be Daleks in it.‚Äù While I said, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôll be Dalek technology that Torchwood have scavenged, and maybe even needed the Doctor‚Äôs help to get it working.‚Äù  But how right he was.</p>\n<p>We should have seen it coming, of course.  When the Doctor said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a storm  coming,‚Äù it was obviously an allusion to ‚ÄúThe Oncoming Storm‚Äù, his supposed nickname amongst the Daleks.  So what could his oncoming storm be?  And then when he said that you could survive the end of the Universe inside a Void craft, it should have leapt out at us as an obvious place to survive the Time War.</p>\n<p>But I thought I had heard that there weren‚Äôt going to be any Daleks in this series.  In fact, I though that Russell T Davies himself had said that.  If so, then it was a great piece of misdirection ‚Äî of lying, let‚Äôs face it ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt hold it against him for a moment.  At last we got a properly non-trailed, non-spoilered surpise baddy arrival: the best since the Cybermen‚Äôs appearance at the end of the first episode of ‚ÄúEarthshock‚Äù.  Almost as good as the Dalek‚Äôs appearance in ‚ÄúDalek‚Äù could have been, if the episode had been called something else and they hadn‚Äôt trailed it.</p>\n<p>Only one more week: what‚Äôll we do without it after that?  <em>And</em> <cite>The West Wing</cite> ends the week after that.  Bah.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I am somewhat mystified by the talk recently about what team Scottish people, and various MPs, particularly Scottish ones, ‚Äúshould‚Äù support in the football World Cup.  There are no ‚Äúshould‚Äùs, of course: anyone can support any football team they want to, or none.  It‚Äôs just daft, at best, that anyone made an issue of it regarding the behaviour of our public servants.</p>\n<p>But the stranger thing, really, is that anyone might expect a Scotland fan  to support England under any circumstances.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt mean here, a Scot who takes little interest in football between World Cups, but might enjoy watching some of what should be the best examples of the game.  I‚Äôm talking about your actual, dedicated football fan.  Some people suggest that such a Scotland fan ought to support England because we are neighbouring countries, and part of the same meta-country.</p>\n<p>But consider this: Spurs and Arsenal are neighbouring teams, and part of the same city; the same can be said of Liverpool and Everton, Manchesters United and City, and perhaps most significantly, of Celtic and Rangers.  Now, tell me this: if Spurs were in the European Cup (as I still think of it) , would an Arsenal fan support them?  Would anyone say that an Arsenal fan ‚Äúshould‚Äù support Spurs?</p>\n<p>Well, I can‚Äôt speak for any of the English teams I mentioned above, but I come from a family of Celtic fans, and was quite a dedicated fan myself in my younger years (before I grew out of the whole thing, and put my interest into music instead), and I can tell you that there is no way on this Earth or beyond that a Celtic fan would ever support Rangers in <em>anything</em>.  <a href=\"/blog/2006/06/26/supporters/\">My Dad‚Äôs saying</a> about it not mattering who wins, only had a tangential application to the national teams.  Its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_form\">Platonic form</a> was, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter who wins, as long as it‚Äôs not Rangers.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm quite sure that Rangers fans feel just as strongly about Celtic‚Äôs successes.</p>\n<p>The logical extension of this interclub rivalry is to the national teams of Scotland and England; and no doubt, to those of various other pairs of nations.  I imagine that French fans are unlikely to support, say, Germany against Brazil, just because they share a land border with one, and only a planet with the other.</p>\n<p>So really, expecting a Scot to support England is crazy.  Supporting the opponent of your greatest rival is perfectly natural behaviour</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Since I finished it this year, it belongs in my 2006 Book Notes.</p>\n<p>Before I get much further I should declare an interest: one of the editors, Andrew, is an old university friend of mine.</p>\n<p>So it might come as no surprise that I am more impressed by the very <em>existence</em> of this boook than by its content.  Which is not to dismiss or belittle the content.  There are some very good stories here, by some top authors and fine newcomers.  But the overall sense of it is less than overwhelming.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most surprising letdown is a sin of omission: where is Scotland‚Äôs most famous SF author; indeed, probably its most famous living author?  No doubt the good Mr <a href=\"http://www.iainbanks.net/\">Banks</a> has other things to do ‚Äî I doubt that he writes short stories at all, these days ‚Äî but you‚Äôd think he could have done an introduction or something.</p>\n<p>The introduction in fact is by David Pringle, the former editor of <cite><a href=\"http://www.ttapress.com/IZ.html\">Interzone</a></cite>: I had no idea that he was even Scottish.  But there you go: we get everywhere.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not going to go through all the stories, just hit a few high and low points.</p>\n<p>In a way the most disappointing story is <a href=\"http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.com/\">Hal Duncan</a>‚Äòs ‚ÄòThe Last Shift‚Äô.  Not because it‚Äôs badly written or anything.  Rather, because it‚Äôs not SF, fantasy, or speculative in any way.  It‚Äôs a sadly-commonplace tale of the last day of a factory whose company is ‚Äúoutsourcing‚Äù or ‚Äúoffshoring‚Äù all the work.  The fact that the characters all have wings and horns like the demons of our world‚Äôs mythology (and that the location doesn‚Äôt exist in our world) neither adds anything to it nor detracts from it in anyway: those factors are just irrelevant.</p>\n<p>Which is a shame.  I‚Äôm a keen reader of Hal‚Äôs blog, and look forward to reading his first novel, <cite>Vellum</cite> (I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that I‚Äôve so far been put off buying it by the price: it‚Äôs a full-price hardback at ¬£17:99, and that just seems a bit too much for an essentially unkown author).</p>\n<p>The high points for me  are probably ‚ÄòSophie and the Sacred Fluids‚Äô by <a href=\"http://scepticpsychic.blogspot.com/\">Andrew C Ferguson</a> (another disclaimer: I also had a passing acquaintance with this Andrew);  ‚ÄòDeus ex Homine‚Äô, by <a href=\"http://tomorrowelephant.net/\">Hannu Rajaniemi</a>; and ‚ÄòSnowball‚Äôs Chance‚Äô, by <a href=\"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static\">Charles Stross</a>.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I‚Äôm very glad it exists, and I‚Äôm glad I read it; but I hope the next volume, if it happens, is better.</p>\n<p>[tags]books, book notes 2006, nova scotia, sf, scotland, science fiction, scottish fiction, scottish literature, scottish sf, scottish writing[/tags]</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><h2>Eyes in the sky</h2>\n<p>There is a strange and mighty power to eye contact, it seems.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not talking about the effects of making ‚Äî or not making ‚Äî eye contact while talking to someone, though of course that does indeed have a great symbolic strength and communicative ability.  Rather, I‚Äôm talking about the effect of making eye contact at a distance; specifically while cycling.</p>\n<p>As you might imagine, cycling round the streets of London has its hazards.  It‚Äôs not as fraught with danger as some believe (fear of the dangers is one of the main reasons people give for why they don‚Äôt, or wouldn‚Äôt, cycle; which is a shame, because it‚Äôs good for the individual, and good for the environment), but that‚Äôs another discussion.</p>\n<p>Most potential problems can be avoided with a suitable degree of alertness.  But the necessary alertness isn‚Äôt all on the part of the cyclist: it‚Äôs important for other road users to be alert to the presence of cyclists, too.  Who remembers ‚ÄúThink once, think twice, think <em>bike!</em>‚Äú, the road-safety campaign on British TV during the seventies?  That was intended to make other road-users more aware of cyclists (and motorcyclists).</p>\n<p>That is where one of the biggest dangers lies: quite frankly, there are a lot of road users who just don‚Äôt notice cyclists.  And it‚Äôs not just the BMW  drivers and Royal Mail vans (in my experience the two most dangerous types of motorised vehicle, from a cyclist‚Äôs point of view (though all generalisations are false, of course)).</p>\n<p>No, any motor vehicle can be a problem, and pedestrians and even other cyclists are almost as bad.  Indeed , the two accidents I‚Äôve had in all my years of cycling in London were both caused, at least in part, by pedestrians.  There is, however, a simple technique that can ‚Äî almost magically, it sometimes seems ‚Äî make other road users notice you.</p>\n<p>Look them in the eye.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs it.  That‚Äôs all there is to it.  Just make eye contact with the driver, cyclist or pedestrian, and suddenly they realise you‚Äôre there.</p>\n<p>Which is not so surprising: it‚Äôs hard to <em>not</em> be aware of the presence of someone who is looking you in the eye.  What is strange, though, is the way in which it works at a distance.  You don‚Äôt have to be able to see the other person‚Äôs eyes, or even to see the person.  Innumerable times I have been hurtling along a road and seen a car or van about to pull out of a side road and smash into me (or at least, make me brake sharply).  I can‚Äôt see the driver because of distance or dark windows, but I aim a hard stare at the area where I know the driver‚Äôs head must be.  And the car (or van) suddenly brakes, and lets me sweep past.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a burst of laser-like staring swept across a group of pedestrians can stop them stepping off the kerb and into my path.  It‚Äôs quite remarkable, really.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm reminded of the story of James Dean‚Äôs death.  He crashed his car into another car that was pulling out of a side road, and supposedly Dean said to his passenger, (who survived the crash), ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, he sees me.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Clearly, the other driver didn‚Äôt.  Perhaps if Dean had just tried looking at where the other driver‚Äôs eyes were, the strange, near-telepathic effect might have happened, and he could have lived to make many more films.</p>\n<p>The effect is, I suspect, related to the ‚Äúfeeling of being watched‚Äù that most people have experienced at some time.   There‚Äôs no obvious mechanism for it, but it does seem to be the case that, when someone is looking at us, we become aware of the fact.</p>\n<h2>Attention surfeit disorder?</h2>\n<p>When some one is looking at us, or is <em>paying attention to us</em>.  Which brings me to another angle on this.  That is the idea of <em>attention.</em>.  Up here in The Future, in the days of the development of ‚ÄúWeb 2.0‚Ä≥ (which, by the way, is pronounced ‚Äútwo point zero‚Äù, not ‚Äútwo point oh‚Äù, as I heard them saying on <cite>Newsnight</cite> the other day; we are, after all, scientists) we are often told (though perhaps mainly by <a href=\"http://doc.weblogs.com/\">Doc Searls</a>) of how important our attention is.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the phrase ‚Äúthe <a href=\"http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_4/goldhaber/\">attention economy</a>‚Äù is in use by some.  Of course, the expression ‚Äúpay attention‚Äù has been around for a long time, but only now has attention taken on some of the other trappings of money.  We can ‚Äúpay‚Äù for a web site‚Äôs services with our attention.  Any site with adverts effectively meets this model, though there are more direct examples, such as <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/\">Salon</a>‚Äòs premium content, for which you can get a ‚Äúday pass‚Äù by <a href=\"http://images.salon.com/src/pass/sitepass/demo2.html?x\">sitting through a short advert</a> ‚Äî as an alternative to paying actual cash for a subscription.</p>\n<p>The force of our attention ‚Äî of looking ‚Äî is powerful in multiple ways.</p>\n<div class=\"simpletags\">Technorati Tags: <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/attention\">attention</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/attention%20economy\">attention economy</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/web%202.0\">web 2.0</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/cycling\">cycling</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/eye%20contact\">eye contact</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/doc%20searls\">doc searls</a></div>\n</body></html>\n",

I had had a quick look at it on the way home from work on Friday, when it was just standing still at the end of Pall Mall. Then, it was clearly impressive; but wasn‚Äôt clear quite how glorious, how <em>majestic</em> it would be once it was moving among crowds.</p>\n<p>We drove in to Holborn and took the Tube to Green Park.  The Tube was crammed, and I assumed (and feared) that everyone there would have the same aim as us.  But no, it was just a commonplace weekend crowd, with many destinations in mind.  When we got out, Piccadilly was busy, but not obviously in an unusual way.</p>\n<p>We could see that the road was partly closed in the direction of  Piccadilly Circus, so we headed that way.  In the distance we could see crowds of people, but no obvious <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/simon-crubellier/142413207/in/set-72057594125598140/\">forty-foot elephant</a> (and it‚Äôs hard to imagine a forty-foot elephant being anything else).  One of the stewards told us that it was going to turn down Haymarket and then into Pall Mall.</p>\n<p>Then, as we got a bit closer to the Circus, I caught a glimpse of a large leather ear flapping, and soon we could all see its head.  But Piccadilly had never seemed so long, and it began to feel as if we wouldn‚Äôt catch it, though it was obviously going very slowly.</p>\n<p>I hoped to get a picture of it with the statue of Eros in the same shot, but it was not to be.  By the time we got to Piccadilly circus, it had already turned into Haymarket.  So we decided to cut down Regent Street and get ahead of it.  Guess what?  We weren‚Äôt the only ones to have that idea.  By this time we were among crowds, but not so dense that it was very hard to move; just dense enough to make us keep a tight hold on the kids.</p>\n<p>A bit of zigzagging through back streets and we found ourselves on Charles II Street.  Iit was clear from the music coming from Haymarket that the elephant hadn‚Äôt passed yet, and from the layout of the crowd that it would be coming along that way.  So we positioned ourselves at the edge of the pavement and waited.</p>\n<p>Sure enought, after a few minutes some stewards came along the street asking people to stay back on the pavements.  Another few minutes and several police officers came along with the same message.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs worth pointing out both how good a job the stewards and the police did, and how little they actually <em>had</em> to do (from what I saw of it).  It just goes to show that you can stage a big event with minimal crowd control.  Treat people with respect and give them something interesting to watch and you don‚Äôt need to herd them through crash barriers like cattle in a slaughterhouse.</p>\n<p>Anyway, a few minutes after <em>that</em>, and the elephant‚Äôs head began to appear round the corner.  It was, as I said above, <em>majestic</em>: that‚Äôs the word that came to my mind as soon as I saw it.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt know if it was the beauty of the beast, or the fact that there were bagpipes among the music that was playing (the pipes always get me like that); but I felt a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye as it approached.</p>\n<p>Then the fucker sprayed me with water.</p>\n<p>Actually, being sprayed was quite fun.  Fortunately it was a hot day.  But I got hit so directly that I could almost hear the operators saying,‚ÄùGet the guy in the orange t-shirt and sunglasses.‚Äù  If you don‚Äôt want to get hit, don‚Äôt dress up like a target, I suppose.</p>\n<p>As the beast itself passed next to us, and I got a brief chance to admire the action of the legs (it moves on wheels, but the leg movement is very convincing), I realised that the music was coming from a truck behind it on which a live band was playing.  I had assumed it was just recordings, but the band added an extra touch, and we got to listen to them up close.  They were good, and I‚Äôd like to find out who they were.</p>\n<p>After it passed, and the crowd thinned a bit, we decided to head round to Waterloo Place to see the Little Girl‚Äôs crashed space capsule; not realising that it had been moved.  No matter, though: it meant we got another view of the elephant as it turned onto Pall Mall.</p>\n<p>And so to home.  We didn‚Äôt stay to see the final√©, so we didn‚Äôt see the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/simon-crubellier/141571479/\">Little Girl</a> at all; nor did we see her spaceship.  All that was left on Waterloo Place was a hole in the road, which people, in their infinite capacity to make a mess, had already started dropping rubbish into.  As it turned out, the ship had been moved to Horseguards for her to leave in.</p>\n<p>It was a fabulous thing to see, though, and I‚Äôm so glad that the Mayor and the <abbr title=\"Greater London Authority\">GLA</abbr> saw fit to have it here.</p>\n<p>My son asked me at one point, as the music surrounded us and the elephant towered over us, ‚ÄúWhy did it come to London?‚Äù   I answered with joy and almost without thinking about it, ‚ÄúBecause this is the best city in the world.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Sometimes it is.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

There, that was easy, wasn‚Äôt it?</p>\n<p>But now; now.</p>\n<p>Now Labour are the ones who are bringing in <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/?p=24\">ID cards</a>.

It should be nothing more than expected.  Nor is the fact of their re-offending in itself part of the scandal.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as has been said elsewhere, these thousand or so released offenders pose no greater or lesser threat to society than any other random thousand offenders.  Their only difference is that they are not British citizens.  Contrary to the belief, perhaps, of the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> and its readers, that does not inherently make them worse people ‚Äî nor, indeed, any more likely to re-offend ‚Äî than those of us who were born here.</p>\n<p>That they should have been deported if the court specified that as part of their sentences is self-evident.  As indeed is the fact that those who were released on licence should have been properly tracked by the appropriate authorities.  These are problems in the systems for which the Home Office is responsible, and as such, they should be investigated and corrected.</p>\n<p>The real scandal, though,  is that the Home Secretary apparently did nothing to correct the problem after it had been identified: he is said to have known about it for some ten months, and only in the last week has he taken any action.  And then only because a diligent opposition MP kept asking questions until he found out about it.</p>\n<p>In a sense the actual problems are minor: the supposedly-lost offenders have been located by the Police and Parole Service.  Most of them are now to be deported (which strikes me as verging on double jeopardy, since they have already done their time, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect this government to let a little thing like that bother them).  Steps have been, or will be, put in place to prevent the same thing happening in future.  If that proves not to be the case, there will be plenty of opposition MPs and journalists quick to point out that the problem still exists.</p>\n<p>What we are seeing is largely an excuse for a mass exercise in xenophobia by the media: a depressing and frankly disgraceful display, which can only help to fuel the arguments of the vile BNP in tomorrow‚Äôs local elections.</p>\n<p>And maybe that is why Clarke should go: for (inadvertantly) giving succour to fascists.</p>\n<p>But if Blair did accept Clarke‚Äôs resignation, who would we get in his place?

Quite widely spaced, so no immediate problem for cyclists or pedestrians: except that <em>anything</em> unnecessary in the way is a distraction and just adds to the complexity of a journey.  And what purpose do they serve?  All they can possibly be for is to stop cars and vans driving in that way.  And while that is something that has been technically possible until now, I wasn‚Äôt at all aware that we had a problem with it.</p>\n<p>Indeed, apart from floor-cleaning machines and those little luggage carts, the only motorised vehicle I‚Äôve ever seen inside Waterloo is an ambulance.  I do hope they haven‚Äôt stopped those from getting in.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more significantly, they have added some sort of tall rack containing, I think, paper timetables or other leaflets.  But they‚Äôve put it in the middle of the floor near the the departures screens.  So not only is it in the way, but from certain positions it obscures the view of the screens.</p>\n<p>Screens which have been hard enough to see since they were introduced, replacing the old big boards.  The screens‚Äô main fault is that they are in the wrong places: over some of the shops which form islands in the concourse, instead of over the entrances to the platforms.  As well as that, the text on them is smaller than the old boards, so you have to stand closer to make them out.  This last will have the effect of amplifying the blockage caused by the rack (this can be proved by a simple piece of geometry, which I won‚Äôt go into).</p>\n<p>At least the rack looks as if it should be easy to remove; but bah, grumble, etc.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I take a couple of weeks off (a week at home with the kids, a week in Dorset: very nice, thanks, since you ask) and when I first get back to posting, I find I‚Äôm channelling the excellent <a href=\"http://www.20six.co.uk/disgruntled\">Disgruntled Commuter</a>.  This morning‚Äôs journey into work was a vision of madness and chaos straight out of Dante‚Äôs <cite>Inferno</cite>.</p>\n<p>I exaggerate, of course.  The Waterloo and City Line is a key link in my standard route to work, when I go purely by public transport.  Hackney to Wimbledon is not the simplest route between two parts of London, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be insane.  That line, though, is currently closed.  Until <em>September</em>.  If we assume it won‚Äôt reopen until the end of that month at the earliest, that means it will be closed for half the year.  I understand that things wear out and break down and have to be maintained: but it only goes between two stations.  There‚Äôs not that much to it.  How long can things take?</p>\n<p>So for two days this week I cycled to Waterloo (I work at home on Wednesdays) which is the best way to get in anyway, for all the usual reasons why cycling is best<sup><a href=\"#tal1_1\" name=\"tal1_1_back\">1</a></sup>.  But lately I‚Äôve fallen out of the habit.  To break myself back in gently (in other words, to give myself a rest from it today, or out of sheer laziness), I decided to chance public transport today.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm a great fan of public transport generally, of course: but there are times and services that‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt show it in its best light, let‚Äôs say.  The North London Line is one that has a bad reputation at best: indeed, the aforementioned Disgruntled one has <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww%2E20six%2Eco%2Euk%2Fdisgruntled+%22north+london+line%22\">written about it</a> in the past.  Yet gettting that line to Highbury and Islington and then the Victoria Line to Vauxhall for the last leg to Wimbledon seemed the best alternative route for me.</p>\n<p>You‚Äôll have guessed, since I‚Äôm writing this, that it was not.</p>\n<p>The North London Line is characterised by infrequent, jam-packed services, and it deserves the characterisation.  Don‚Äôt get the idea that this was a surprise to me: I knew perfectly well what it would be like.  What do you think was the biggest prod to get me back onto my bike?</p>\n<p>So that wasn‚Äôt really the problem (though the difficulty of seeing the station name signs when you‚Äôre jammed in standing up makes it extra hard for the infrequent user to be sure they are at the correct station).  No, the problem was my old friend<sup><a href=\"#tal1_2\" name=\"tal1_2_back\">2</a></sup> the Victoria Line.</p>\n<p>It was, in short, fucked.</p>\n<p>So I got on that curious bit of non-Underground underground line that also runs out of Highbury and Islington (and that I can‚Äôt remember the name of), and got a train to Moorgate.  Thence by Northern Line to London Bridge and Jubilee to Waterloo.  I left home at about 8:15 (significantly later than I originally intended to, admittedly) and the train from Waterloo pullled into Wimbledon at 9:35.  Bah!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<p><a name=\"tal1_1\" href=\"#tal1_1_back\">1.</a> Exercise, knowing fairly exactly when you‚Äôre going to get there, and not being at the mercy of the transport network chief among them.</p>\n<p><a name=\"tal1_2\" href=\"#tal1_2_back\">2.</a> Before I lived in Hackney I lived in Walthamstow.

It is a portrait of a single day in the life of its protagonist, one Henry Perowne, a successful neurosurgeon.<br>\n<!--more--><br>\nFor a large part of the novel there is essentially no plot as such.  Indeed you could probably argue that the whole thing has no plot; though things happen early in the day that have consequences later in the day.  But despite the exiling of plot ‚Äî of story itself, you might say ‚Äî to the background, this is an immensely compelling work.</p>\n<p>Such is the quality of the writing (I can only assume: I can‚Äôt honestly say that I understand how he does it) that the small and largely insignificant actions of one man and his family, and the musings of that man (it is a third-person narrative, but with only a single viewpoint; it is exclusively focalised on/through Perowne) command the attention and require the turning of pages.</p>\n<p>This is great, really great; and the characters are endearing enough that I want to know what happened to them afterwards: indeed, what is still happening to them now.</p>\n<p>Everything I‚Äôve ever read about this book makes quite a big thing of the Saturday in question being the one of the big anti-(Iraq) war demo in London (and around the world).  But in fact that is only really a very minor physical background to an early chapter.  Certainly it provides fuel for Perowne‚Äôs thoughts, and for a heated discussion with his daughter; but the fact of it happening on that day is not really significant.  Which makes me wonder whether he only did it as an attention-grabbing device, much as Banksie did when he set the first chapter  of <cite>Dead Air</cite> on the 11th of September, 2001.  Still, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with grabbing the reader‚Äôs attention, as long as the device is integrated fully into the story, and doesn‚Äôt jar with the narrative: and such is the case here.</p>\n<p>[tags]books, book notes 2006, reviews, this year‚Äôs reading, ian mcewan, ‚ÄúSaturday‚Äù, booker nominees[/tags]</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Turning away from politics, for a wee while, I‚Äôve been finding things have been pretty good in the TV world, recently.</p>\n<p>I thoroughly enjoyed <cite><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/lifeonmars/\">Life On Mars</a></cite> on BBC 1, recently.  I expected slightly better ‚Äî or at least different ‚Äî of it when it was first announced: I thought there would be more (or some) ambiguity or doubt about whether Sam Tyler was experiencing it all in his mind while in a coma, or had actually travelled in time.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the start there was no such ambiguity about that, and we were deep in <cite><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_(Iain_Banks)\">The Bridge</a></cite> or <cite><a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,772790,00.html\">Marabou Stork Nightmares</a></cite> territory (if you can compare a TV series with a novel, then I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs better than the latter but nowhere near as good (obviously) as the former).  What I was hoping for in the final episode, though, is that Sam would wake up back in 2006; and that he would then look into the history of the personnel at the station, and find that Gene Hunt and the others (and DI Sam Tyler, for that matter) really existed.  Maybe he would even look up a now-aged and retired Gene, an Annie who is a grandmother.</p>\n<p>Obvious, maybe, but it could have been a nice touch.</p>\n<p>I had some mixed feelings about the whole thing, though.  I wanted it to be resolved and completed, for dramatic satisfaction.   But I so much enjoyed the interactions between the characters (especially the growing and grudging respect between Tyler and Hunt) and the quality of most of the stories that I became (and remain) keen to see more.  If he had woken up, there would be no going back.</p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/W/westwing/\">The West Wing</a></cite> maintained its high standard through the recent season (in fact this season, 6, was significantly better than 5 was, I would say) and I‚Äôm profoundly glad that we got a digibox and so could watch it on the excellent More4, rather than having to wait for the DVDs to be released.  More4 are taking us straight into season 7, so only <strike>22</strike> 21 more weeks and then it‚Äôs over forever.</p>\n<p>More4 is also where we get <cite><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Show\">The Daily Show With John Stewart</a></cite>, to give it its full-length name.  This is just a fabulous show; hilarious, thought-provoking and informative.  What more could you ask for?</p>\n<p>Well, I could ask for something as good ‚Äî and in a similar vein ‚Äî for Britain.</p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/\">The IT Crowd</a></cite> was disappointing enough after two or three episodes that I didn‚Äôt bother to work around its clashing with <cite>The West Wing</cite> on Friday nights).  I‚Äôve read <a href=\"http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2006/02/06/\">some positive comments</a> on it, though, and it <em>ought</em> to have been good, given its pedigree; so maybe I‚Äôll watch out for the repeats.  I wonder if that stupid announcer ever stopped calling it ‚ÄòThe it Crowd‚Äô, though?</p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/hyperdrive/\">Hyperdrive</a></cite> was largely disappointing, and <cite>Invasion</cite> just petered out: that is, I petered out of watching it.</p>\n<p>Most importantly (in comedy, at least): at last they‚Äôve started showing the trailers I‚Äôve been waiting for: ‚ÄúNew <cite><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423661/\">Green Wing</a></cite>.  Nearly ready.‚Äù  Hooray!  The funniest comedy of the last few years: right up there with <cite><a href=\"http://www.absolutelyandy.com/absolutely/\">Absolutely</a></cite>  I can hardly wait.</p>\n<p>And to top all that, my old friend from uni, <a href=\"http://talefromtwocities.blogspot.com/\">Paul Cockburn</a> inadvertently <a href=\"http://talefromtwocities.blogspot.com/2006/03/secret-devotee.html\">reminds me</a> that the new <cite><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho\">Doctor Who</a></cite> will be starting quite soon.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>There is now a deadly danger to British democracy.  One that is even worse than the <a href=\"http://devilgate.livejournal.com/31871.html\">ID cards</a> bill.</p>\n<p>Not for nothing are they calling it the ‚ÄòAbolition of Parliament‚Äô bill.  Its official name is the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/141/06141.1-7.html\">Legislative and Regulatory Reform bill</a>, and it is, quite simply an attempt to take control of power in this country into the hands of the executive forever,and remove the possibility of parliamentary scrutiny from the exercise of that power.</p>\n<p>The bill grants ministers the power to create, modify or strike down laws;  and to introduce offenses carrying prison terms of up to two years.</p>\n<p>It contains some limits: for example section 3(2)(c) requires that ‚Äúthe provision, taken as a whole, strikes a fair balance between the public interest and the interests of any person adversely affected by it‚Äù.  However, remember that the bill grants the power to modify existing legislation; that does not exclude itself.  So if this bill had become an Act of Parliament, there would be nothing to stop a future government from modifying the Act itself to, for example, increase the maximum sentence, or remove the limitations it contains.</p>\n<p>This government has, after early successes in introducing the minimum wage and the Human Rights Act, been moving in a more and more authoritarian direction.  Obvious examples are ID cards; the attempt to reduce the right to trial by jury; and the increase in the period of detention without trial.</p>\n<p>But let‚Äôs not forget their support for US ‚Äòextreme rendition‚Äô flights, and the illegal detentions at Guant√°namo Bay (they may not have actively and openly supported those, but they failed to condemn them, or do anything to stop them, which amounts to the same thing).</p>\n<p>From ASBOs to the ‚ÄòRespect Agenda‚Äô<sup><a href=\"#abolition_ftn1\" title=\"abolition_ftn1_back\">1</a></sup>, it‚Äôs clear that Blair and his spineless ‚Äî or perhaps totally complicit ‚Äî cronies are all about applying controls and limits.</p>\n<p>If this bill goes through, there are, as far as I can tell, two possible escape routes.  Judges ‚Äî even the Law Lords ‚Äî might strike it down as unlawful under the Human Rights Act, since they are required to consider all new laws in light thereof.  The problem there, though, is that the bill ‚Äî the Act, if it passes ‚Äî does not directly infringe anyone‚Äôs human rights.  Instead, it is an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act\">enabler</a>.  It is laws introduced or modified using this Act that may (that will, let‚Äôs face it) infringe our human rights.</p>\n<p>The second escape route?  I can‚Äôt see one short of revolution.  And that means civil war.  And that‚Äôs no escape at all.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre reading this, please: don‚Äôt just take my word for it.  Visit the <a href=\"http://saveparliament.org.uk/\">Save Parliament</a> website and look at the resources there.  Do some other research.  But when you are suitably terrified, <a href=\"http://www.writetothem.com/\">write to your MP</a>; write to the editor of your favourite paper and ask them why they are not kicking up a fuss about this.  Tell your friends.  Tell your enemies.  Tell people in the street</p>\n<p>If we don‚Äôt stop this, it may not mean jackboots in the streets and the knock on the door in the night; but it will mean the effective end of democracy in the UK.</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<a href=\"#abolition_ftn1_back\" title=\"abolition_ftn1\">1.</a><br>\nOn ‚Äòrespect‚Äô: I am convinced that Blair doesn‚Äôt mean that word as the rest of us mean it.  Instead, what he really wants to see more of in society is <em>deference</em>.  When I thought of this truth several months ago, my attitude was, ‚ÄúStuff it mate, we‚Äôve left that behind us a century or more ago, and we ain‚Äôt going back to it.‚Äù  But now, of course, I feel the terror that deference will be made mandatory by ministerial diktat.\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

This one is on my own site, for one thing.</p>\n<p>A new blog, though: just what the world needs, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/\">don‚Äôt you think</a>?</p>\n<p>As this is the first entry here, I can‚Äôt help but feel a certain‚Ä¶ pressure, let‚Äôs say.  Because, after all, in years to come, when this blog is one of the most popular sites on the internet<sup><a title=\"first_note1_back\" href=\"#first_note1\">1</a></sup>, millions of people will look back through the entries, and pay special attention to the first one.  Obviously its content is critically important.  Unfortunately, its content is rubbish.</p>\n<p>Well, its content was going to be rubbish: or rather, <em>about</em> rubbish; about the guy who was <a href=\"http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=361722006\">fined for dropping rubbish into a bin</a>.</p>\n<p>But many people have written about the stupidity of that, and in any case, the council in question have already, and predictably, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/4792490.stm\">gone back on their foolish decision</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead I thought I might write about the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/4788912.stm\">hat woman</a>.  But actually that‚Äôs too boring to go into.  Pubs with ‚Äúno-hat‚Äù rules, though: truly madness walks among us.  Actually, the scary thing about that story is that there are pubs with CCTV cameras <em>inside</em> them.  Truly we are the most watched society in the world.</p>\n<p>Maybe that should be the theme of this blog, if it needs one: the madness of modern society.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd hate to come over like some old grouch, though, railing against modernity: ‚ÄúIt wisnae like that when ah wuz a wean, by the way jimmy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Or not too often, at least.  No, instead, like most blogs ‚Äî like all the best ones ‚Äî I‚Äôll just write about whatever the hell I feel like.</p>\n<p>Modern weirdness, though: I just heard about the recent trends for ‚Äú<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4792104.stm\">internet suicides</a>‚Äù in Japan; and the fact that the US Nasdaq exchange has <a href=\"http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1728537,00.html\">made an offer to buy the London Stock Exchange</a>.  Apparently there are shares in the Stock Exchange: it‚Äôs a company.  For some reason I find this immensely surprising.   I would have thought (if I had ever thought of such a thing) that it was some kind of public body, like the Bank of England.  Apparently not, though.   Life‚Äôs strangenesses, I think, will be a recurring feature here.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a title=\"first_note1\" href=\"#first_note1_back\">1.</a> this is meant to be humorous, by the way.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It sounded absolutely fantastic, and I‚Äôve wanted to read it ever since.  But I only got round to buying it recently.</p>\n<p>I was aware, of course, of the danger of approaching a work with unreasonably-raised expectations, so I tried not to.  You can‚Äôt make yourself think ‚ÄúThis won‚Äôt be very good,‚Äù when you actually think, ‚ÄúThis should be pretty good.‚Äù  The trick, therefore, is to convince yourself to have a slight seed of doubt.  I‚Äôm not totally sure how well that can ever work, though.</p>\n<p>I did enjoy the book, however: it starts with a light, easy style, and has an endearing central character in Sumire.  <!--more-->The unnamed (though referred to in the back-cover blurb as ‚ÄúK‚Äù) narrator is a slightly-annoying, madly-but-unrequitedly in love  with Sumire figure.  They met at university.  Sumire dropped out to write; the narrator went on to become a schoolteacher.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the start of the book, Sumire, who has until then seemed largely devoid of any sexual or romantic feelings, falls in love with an older, married, woman; who then gives her a job as her <abbr title=\"Personal Assistant\">PA</abbr>.  Sumire‚Äôs love is also unrequited; indeed, unspoken.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs when they go on a business trip to Europe, which culminates in a holiday on a Greek island, that something strange happens.</p>\n<p>It is a curious book.  It‚Äôs hard to work out what is supposed to have happened to Sumire.  It is, until then, so much a realist novel that it is hard to believe that the apparently-fantastic, dream world sequence that is all the explanation we get, is meant to be taken literally.</p>\n<p>Then when the narrator, having gone to Greece to help find out what happened to Sumire, returns home to Japan,  there is an apparently-unrelated section concerning one of his pupils.  He has been having a sexual relationship with the pupil‚Äôs mother, so when the boy gets into trouble, she calls him to help.  This section really appears to have no connection to the rest of the story,, and no bearing on what happened to Sumire.</p>\n<p>So while I enjoyed reading it, on looking back over it, it seems that  it is deeply flawed.  Or maybe I‚Äôm flawed, because I failed to fully understand it.</p>\n<p>I expected that it would inspire me to read more of his work, but it hasn‚Äôt: or not yet, at least.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>But not cards, for a change.  I was listening to a programme (essentially a religious one) on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/\">Radio 4</a> recently, about ‚ÄòIntelligent‚Äô Design (ID).</p>\n<p>It was the second time that day that I had heard <a href=\"http://www.seti.org\"><abbr title=\"Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence\">SETI</abbr></a> pulled in to support ID.  The thesis seems to be that, since SETI searches for meaningful information hidden within random noise, it is ‚Äúthe same as‚Äù the search for a designer amidst the seeming randomness of the universe.  The proponents of ID think that the complexity of the real world means that there must be an intelligence behind it.  But the main thing these people need to learn is that complexity does not equal design.</p>\n<p>Or not necessarily, at any rate.  They are doubly confusing themselves ‚Äî and others, who may be unsure about the realities of science and the tricks of creationists.  They look at the <em>search</em> for order among the chaos, and liken it to ‚Äî really, identify it with ‚Äî the <em>belief</em> that order lies behind the chaos.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs put it another way.  SETI searches through random noise and attempts to find ordered data, all the while aware that the ordered data may not be there; indeed, to date it has not been.  It further proposes that, <em>if</em> ordered data is found, then that may imply that there is an intelligence behind it.</p>\n<p>The ID proponents observe the order in the universe and <em>assume</em> that there must be an intelligence behind it; they also see the randomness in the universe, and jump to the conclusion that SETI is doing the same thing as they are.</p>\n<p>It is arrant nonsense, of course, but then ID <em>is</em>, from start to finish.  Oh, don‚Äôt get me wrong: there‚Äôs nothing in the laws of physics, chemistry or biology that <em>precludes</em> the existence of a designer, a creator, a supreme being: a deity, in short.  As, indeed, there is no need for science to be incompatible with belief in, or the existence of, a deity.  Back when I was a Catholic, I remember one of my primary-school  teachers explaining that, while the <cite>Bible</cite> says that God created the world in six days, a day to God might be a million years to us.  Don‚Äôt take it literally, in other words.</p>\n<p>And therein lies the problem: creationists and believers in ID (who are just very thinly-disguised creationists) take the <cite>Bible</cite> (though which version, I have to ask?) literally.</p>\n<p>Which is a bit like taking any of humanity‚Äôs great history of myths literally.  Why stop with the Christian <cite>Bible</cite>, and their strange god, ‚ÄúGod‚Äù<sup><a href=\"#IDesign1_1\">1</a></sup>?  Let‚Äôs take the Norse gods literally, for example.  So the next time you‚Äôre caught in a thunderstorm, remember, it‚Äôs not just the random discharge of static electricity in the atmosphere: Thor is after you.</p>\n<p>Or the Greeks: they had some great ones.  When you light the gas to cook tea tonight, say a prayer of thanks to Prometheus, OK?</p>\n<p>Oh look, we seem to be back at my latest <a href=\"http://devilgate.livejournal.com/tag/book+notes\">Book Notes</a> post, <a href=\"http://devilgate.livejournal.com/32227.html\"><cite>American Gods</cite></a>.  Which makes sense, since it is American fundamentalist Christers who want to foist their god on the rest of their country ‚Äî and by extension, on the rest of the world.  By the not-so-subtle device of using the law to control what can and can‚Äôt be taught in schools.  What is wrong with these people?  Have they never heard of the separation of church and state?</p>\n<p>Fortunately the US courts seem to be holding the line of sanity so far; but oh my non-existent, speculative all-powerful creator-figure: I hope we don‚Äôt get a branch of the Christian Taliban trying to introduce this shite into our schools over here.  I have children to bring up, so I have a direct interest in these things.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs not teach our kids to be stupid.</p>\n<hr><a name=\"IDesign1_1\">1</a>.

Oh, maybe not now, and maybe not even that soon; but when the identity cards bill is passed, and the database has been built <sup><a href=\"#id1_1\">1</a></sup> then the infrastructure will be in place for the world‚Äôs largest ever experiment in social control.</p>\n<p>We already have near-ubiquitous surveillance, with constantly-improving automatic recognition: of faces and of vehicle number plates.  Add to that the national identity database with its biometrics, and the growing collection of DNA data, and I foresee the potential for a future that even Orwell in his worst nightmare wouldn‚Äôt have believed possible.</p>\n<p>Pessimistic?  Yes, certainly.  It may be that the public will rebel against it when they realise how much it will cost, for example.  I gather that that is what happened in Australia.  But even if they do, once the legislation is in place, how can it be stopped?¬† It seems likely that the best we can hope for there is a change of government.

Imagine, though, what it would have been like if Thatcher‚Äôs government had had ubiquitous, mandatory ID and surveillance.  Imagine (as <a href=\"http://devilgate.livejournal.com/26650.html\">I‚Äôve suggested before</a>) if that had been the situation during the miners‚Äô strike.

The <a href=\"http://www.4ad.com/pixies/\">Pixies</a> took the place apart and restored my faith in rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll when I didn‚Äôt even realise I was losing it.  <a href=\"http://www.slf.com/\">Stiff Little Fingers</a> ‚Äî who were the first band I ever saw live (Glasgow Apollo, 1980) ‚Äî played a farewell gig there (OK, they later reformed, but lets not worry too much about that).  At one <a href=\"http://www.jamestheband.com/\">James </a>gig there, a moshpit full of lovemuppets collapsed on top of me.</p>\n<p>But I‚Äôve seen <a href=\"http://www.pogues.com/\">The Pogues</a> there more often than anyone else.</p>\n<p>And The Pogues, it seems, have reformed, and are touring.   To Brixton, then, with <a href=\"http://swisstone.livejournal.com/\" class=\"lj-user\">swisstone</a>.   I saw them so many times in the eighties and early nineties that I probably wouldn‚Äôt have bothered this time.  But back in the summer <a href=\"http://karmicnull.livejournal.com/\" class=\"lj-user\">karmicnull</a> gave me a CD by an American band called the <a href=\"http://www.dropkickmurphys.com/\">Dropkick Murphys</a>, which I love; and guess who was the support band?</p>\n<p>The Murphys take US hardcore (in the punk sense) and Irish (and a touch of Scottish) music, and mash them together in the same way The Pogues first did with UK punk and Irish music two decades ago.  Loud thrashing guitars meld with bagpipes and rebel lyrics.  There are about six or seven of them, and they move around the Academy‚Äôs huge stage like it‚Äôs their playground.</p>\n<p>That said, and though they rocked mightily, the cavernous space of the Academy did them no favours.  They would, I think, be enjoyed best in a smaller venue.  About a tenth of the size, say.  I found it hard work to appreciate some of the songs I don‚Äôt know, so I suspect that if you don‚Äôt know their work at all, they would be very hard work indeed, live.  Then there‚Äôs their version of ‚ÄòThe Wild Rover‚Äô.  Maybe Americans aren‚Äôt as used as we are to every dodgy folk band or drunken denizen of an Irish pub singing this one: but you‚Äôd think that when your fort√© is speeded up, punked up versions of Irish songs, you wouldn‚Äôt do a version of it that is, frankly, plodding.</p>\n<p>No matter: I‚Äôve now heard them do ‚ÄòFields of Athenry‚Äô, live, and am happy.</p>\n<p>As to The Pogues: what with one thing and another, I wasn‚Äôt totally sure what to expect, after all this time.  But I shouldn‚Äôt have worried: it was like coming home: both for them and for me.</p>\n<p>Let me say this, in no uncertain terms: I don‚Äôt think Shane is anywhere near as fucked up as we think he is.  Yes, he‚Äôs done himself damage over the years, and I‚Äôve seem him interviewed on TV and been embarassed and wished they had left him alone.  But that night, although he moved with something of an Ozzy-Osbourne-esque shamble, he was totally switched on.  He didn‚Äôt miss a single word, as far as I could tell, and the only mistake he made was that he messed up the first verse of the very last song, ‚ÄòFiesta‚Äô; and that‚Äôs the kind of thing that any singer can do.</p>\n<p>Physically, too, he was very together.  During one song he kept playing with the mike stand, for example, and seemed to constantly be on the verge of knocking it over: but he always caught it.  And at one point he balanced a glass of water on his head.</p>\n<p>But what of the music?  It was, of course, superb.  I say ‚Äúof course‚Äù because The Pogues consists of some of the most talented musicians in rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll, and perhaps the English language‚Äôs greatest living poet.</p>\n<p>One of their greatest abilities is to make London seem magical, mystic ghostly: songs like ‚ÄòLullaby of London‚Äô is a fine example of this.  And ‚ÄòLondon You‚Äôre A Lady‚Äô and ‚ÄòMisty Morning, Albert Bridge‚Äô are hymns to the city that are rooted in more mundane concerns; but they still evoke a lyrical beauty.  In a way the effect is not unlike that of Wordsworth‚Äôs ‚Äò<a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/101/520.html\">Composed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802</a>‚Äò.  Yes, I think Shane McGowan is as important a poet as Wordsworth, all right?</p>\n<p>There was a spectre hanging over the show, though: it was nearly Christmas, and it was unthinkable that they wouldn‚Äôt do ‚ÄòFairytale of New York‚Äô.  But who would sing Kirsty McColl‚Äôs part?  The song is inherently a duet; there is no way it could be done without two voices.</p>\n<p>Tony told me he had heard that Cerys Matthews of Catatonia sang it at the Cardiff gig, but he didn‚Äôt think that she was touring with them.</p>\n<p>So the end of the third encore and second hour drew close.  ‚ÄúThis is ‚ÄòFairytale of New York‚Äô‚Äù, Shane growled, to cheers.  Then one of the others introduced ‚ÄúMiss Ella Finer.‚Äù  One of The Pogues is Jem Finer, as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll know if you‚Äôve read this far; so I suspected this was his daughter (and internet sources confirm this).</p>\n<p>She wasn‚Äôt Kirsty, of course, but she did a fine job.  Some of her vowels were on the plummy side (‚ÄúHappy Christmas your arse, I pray God it‚Äôs our larst‚Äù, if you see what I mean): but you can‚Äôt hold that against her.</p>\n<p>So as far as I‚Äôm concerned, The Pogues are back.  Now, let‚Äôs just hope they write some new material and put a new album out.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

He was doing one night in London, with, as it turned out, the executive producer and the head writer of the show.</p>\n<p>It was good, though it could cynically be seen as an extended advert for their book, <cite>America: The Book</cite>.  The largest part of the 75-minute show  consisted of readings of extracts from the book.  Those were enough to make me want to buy it,  but the the funniest lines were probably in Stewart‚Äôs introductory piece.  The final section, consisting of questions from the audience, showed that both he and his co-stars are generally witty and able to think on their feet.</p>\n<p>If volume of applause is a measure, though, the highlight of the night for much of the audience was a brief guest appearance.  ‚ÄúFor this next section we‚Äôre going to ask for help from a member of the audience.  We picked him before we started, so don‚Äôt get up.‚Äù  Then a stocky, black-clad figure walked on.  From my position high on the balcony, and with my notedly-poor facial-recognition skills, I couldn‚Äôt tell who it was (though Frances, sitting next to me, could).   I‚Äôd have recognised his voice, though.  Ricky Gervais is officially more popular in London than Jon Stewart (which is not a surprise).</p>\n<p>Gervais read the ‚Äúfunny names‚Äù from the book.  This is a section on how US newscasters, weather forecasters and so on, can‚Äôt have anything like an ordinary name.  The authors identified formulas for the name-construction for the various roles.  ‚ÄúA monosyllabic kitchen-related verb, followed by two unconnected words.  Eg ‚ÄòChop Muddybottom.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>As further evidence, were it needed, of my poor celeb-recognition, apparently I literally rubbed shoulders with Alan Rickman on the way out; then Frances said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Salman Rushdie over there.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù  ‚ÄúThere: standing in the middle of the road, with all the people round him.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I did even eventually see him, and recognised him.  And while I accept that I‚Äôm bad at recognising faces ‚Äî and celebrities in particular ‚Äî I would contend that I just hadn‚Äôt noticed him in the crowd at first, and recognised him perfectly well once I knew he was there..</p>\n<p>Oh, and the title of this post?  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt torture.  We like to call it, uh, ‚Äòfreedom tickling‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Now, I read the first chapter of this a long time ago, in the dealers‚Äô room at a convention.¬† I liked it a lot, and wanted to read on, but the hardback was a bit too expensive at the time.</p>\n<p>I decided to keep an eye out for the paperback.¬† And I did: over the years I often checked the shelves for it, but never found it. As far as I could tell, it never came out in paperback, at least in this country.</p>\n<p>And all of this was before Amazon and so on, so I couldn‚Äôt just search for it.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>OK, so on Monday I posted the final <abbr title=\"Tutor-Marked Assessment\">TMA</abbr> for my <abbr title=\"Open University\">OU</abbr> course, <cite><a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/a103/\">A103: An Introduction to the Humanities</a></cite>. It was long, and broad, and mostly very good (though don‚Äôt get me started about the History of Science block). So now I have my life back: I can read whatever I feel like reading, and not just coursework and the texts I‚Äôm studying; I can write what I want to, and not just the essay for the current assignment.</p>\n<p>You have no idea ‚Äî or rather, <em>I</em> had no idea ‚Äî how much reading time a thing like that takes up. I do most of my reading while commuting nowadays, and sure enough, I did most of my studying while commuting. An hour each way makes ten hours a week. Subtract the times I didn‚Äôt do that, and add in the other time I spent, and I suspect that‚Äôs about the average time I spent overall: ten hours a week. Which is probably more than I did as an undergraduate 22 years ago. Well, OK, not counting going to lectures and stuff.</p>\n<p><!--more Musings on my academic choices follow...--></p>\n<p>Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but these days I frequently wonder whether I did the wrong degree. I‚Äôm glad to have a scientific background, and I don‚Äôt doubt that it helped me to get job as a programmer; but recently, given that I‚Äôve been doing well on the OU course, I‚Äôve been wondering whether I shouldn‚Äôt have done English all those years ago. Maybe, though, I wouldn‚Äôt have been so successful at it back then: perhaps I needed the experiences I‚Äôve had over the years before I could tackle the Humanities with enough understanding.</p>\n<p>But I certainly think I should have done Computer Science rather than (or as well as) Physics. I did, in fact, express an interest in doing a half course in <abbr title=\"Computer Science\">CS</abbr> during my first meeting with my Director of Studies. It wasn‚Äôt possible (he told me) to fit it in with the half course in Astronomy that I was doing because I intended to do Astrophysics: they were both in the afternoons (unlike most lectures) and that would have left no time for my Physics lab. I was too shy and unassertive to argue the point; he was too uninterested to discuss alternative possibilities. Note that his role was ‚ÄòDirector‚Äô; not ‚ÄòAdvisor‚Äô or ‚ÄòCounsellor‚Äô. Indeed, I put my failure to study CS squarely down to the failure of the Scottish educational establishment of the time to give me any careers advice worthy of the name.</p>\n<p>I accept partial blame for the latter failure, of course. At the ages of sixteen and seventeen, when I had what passed for careers advice meetings at my school, I wasn‚Äôt in the least interested in having a career (unless it involved rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll); so I didn‚Äôt exactly involve myself in my careers discussions. University was just somewhere to go to get away from home, have money, get drunk, and all the usual student things; plus it was what my parents expected (not so much the getting drunk, etc, bits, but you know what I mean). But you would think that they (the careers advisors) could have worked out (or helped me to work out) that the only thing I really liked at school (I was good at Maths, Physics and Chemistry, and for that matter, not bad at English and Spanish, which werere the Highers I did, but I would never have said I actually <em>liked</em> them) was being in the Computer Club, where we learned to program in BASIC.</p>\n<p>It really never occured to me that I could study Computers at University. I knew, of course, that Unis had lots of subjects that we didn‚Äôt do at school, but I had no inkling of how you would go about starting one. I guess I was pretty unimaginative in that way. There was one guy in my class who was planning to do CS, but he already knew much more about computers than I did (hell, he even knew some Fortran) so that put me off the possibility even if I did consider it: clearly you had to know much more than me to study such things. I wonder what happened to Billy Gibson; the last I heard he had dropped out of Uni.</p>\n<p>If I <em>had</em> done CS, I don‚Äôt know that my life subsequently would have been that different. I suppose I might have got a job sooner, since I‚Äôd almost certainly have had a better degree; and it‚Äôs possible that that wouldn‚Äôt have been in London, which could have made a huge difference. But even if that had happened, London had been Calling for a long time, so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd have ended up here eventually. The main thing is whether I‚Äôd have been doing a particular philosophy course at the <a href=\"http://www.citylit.ac.uk/\">City Lit</a> at the end of 1992. Not doing that would have made a big, <em>big</em> difference.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

A couple of weeks ago, on a Saturday morning, I fell down from a raised area in our back garden. I landed with pretty much all my (not insigificant) weight on my left leg. and twisted my knee quite badly. The consultant thinks I‚Äôve busted my <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/18003.htm\">anterior cruciate ligament</a>, but I‚Äôm still waiting for an appointment for an MRI scan to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>So I‚Äôm hobbling around with a crutch and a knee brace, mostly annoyed with myself, because if I‚Äôd stepped more carefully, or been wearing different shoes, it probably wouldn‚Äôt have happened. The offending, extra-slippery trainers have been cast out into the recycling bin where there will be weeping, gnashing of teeth, and, hopefully, recycling. But it‚Äôll be a long time, I fear, until <em>I‚Äôm</em> cycling again.</p>\n<p>Back on politics, who are these people who, apparently, want Britain to leave the European Union? What kind of madness is that? I mean, aside from the probable contribution of the EU and its predecessors to keeping peace in Europe for the last fifty years, and the advantages I listed <a href=\"http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.mccallion/pieces/vote2001.html\">here</a>; aside from all that: who the <em>hell</em> do they think we‚Äôd trade with?</p>\n<p>They‚Äôve just announced that UKIP have won a council seat in Hull.

Said Psion broke down the other day. I sent it to <a href=\"http://posltd.com/\">POS</a> in Streatham to get fixed.. It came back today, and it has turned green (from being black before). There was no explanation, but I assume that what they‚Äôve done is, rather than repair my one, they‚Äôve transplanted the guts of it into a reconditioned body. It‚Äôs quite fetching, really.</p>\n<p>I like the mood of the discussion on election-night programs: it‚Äôs serious, of course, but there‚Äôs a lightness. You get a bit of banter between the presenters and the guests. Of course, it was a lot bleaker during the dark-blue days of the eighties and early- to mid-nineties‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt understand why there‚Äôs so much fuss over the postal ballots this time: we had them for the last two elections here in Hackney (first London Mayoral and local council). This time it‚Äôs back to proper polling booths, though. I much prefer it that way.

But I mention it now because I‚Äôm beginning to think it might hold a lot of truth, for me at least.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve spent a lot of my time reading about music, though: all through the punk years I bought <i>Sounds</i>; then after a hiatus while at university I read the <i>NME</i> in the late eighties and all through the nineties.  Even today, I read <i>Uncut</i> from time to time (growing up means switching from a weekly to a monthly schedule: discuss). As well as that, I‚Äôve read a number of musical biographies: The Beatles, The Doors, The Velvet Underground, The Clash, The Stones‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>So reading about music is commonplace to me.  Why, then, should I suddenly begin to doubt the worth of writing about it?</p>\n<p>Well, it‚Äôs this here <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/\">Open University</a> course I‚Äôm three weeks into.¬† <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/a103/\">A103, ‚ÄúAn Introduction to the Humanities‚Äù</a> covers an unfeasibly broad set of subjects, of course.¬† The idea is to give us a grounding in various disciplines, and the tools with which to learn to study them.</p>\n<p>So far we‚Äôve looked at art history, literature (in the form of the sonnet) and this week, music.</p>\n<p>Trouble is, while I found it fairly easy to write about art, and even easier to write about literature (that‚Äôs why I signed up in the first place, as I may not have made entirely clear <a href=\"http://devilgate.livejournal.com/14417.html\">back there</a>), writing about music is another matter entirely, I‚Äôm discovering.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt have the vocabulary: as well as what I know from general knowledge, and what I‚Äôve learned in more years than I care to remember bashing a guitar, I‚Äôve picked up enough in the last week or so to be able to discuss timbre and tempo and texture with the best of them (the best of them in my tutor group, anyway).¬† No, the problem is that I don‚Äôt find music evokes in me the images that other say it does.¬† Yeah, I can tell when a piece is dramatic or sad, for example.¬† But when in tonight‚Äôs tutorial they played a piece that everyone who commented said made them think of water in some form (except for the woman from Israel who said it reminded her of her national anthem), I just thought it was a kind of not-very-interesting swooshy piece.¬† It was, in fact, supposed to represent a river ‚Äî it was a ‚Äú<a href=\"http://www.faribaultcatholics.com/church/music/glossaryofmusicterms.htm\">tone poem</a>‚Äú, apparently.</p>\n<p>Maybe I‚Äôm unimaginative; but the problem for me, really, is the lack of words.¬† It‚Äôs always been words that have drawn me to songs ‚Äî in combination with the music, of course: the best words in the world could be ruined by a crappy tune or insipid performance.</p>\n<p>But not <em>completely</em> ruined.</p>\n<p>I have concluded that most of the reading about music I listed above was actually rather about <em>musicians</em>.¬† Which is fair enough, but doesn‚Äôt help much.</p>\n<p>None of this is to say that I haven‚Äôt enjoyed the music section so far; just that it‚Äôs more challenging than the rest.</p>\n<p>But which blows my punk credentials more: having to listen to <a href=\"http://www.hildegard.org/\">Hildegard of Bingen</a> or <a href=\"http://www.j-tull.com/\">Jethro Tull</a>?</p>\n<p>Next week: philosophy.¬† In the meantime I‚Äôm off to compare and contrast St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and the Millennium Bridge by means of interpretive dance.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Somehow they slipped a <a href=\"http://books.fantasticfiction.co.uk/x0/x4359.htm?authorid=149\">new Iain Banks book</a> out without me noticing.  <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1844131955/ref%3Dnosim/authordatabase/202-9480152-3265423\">Raw Spirit: In search of the perfect dram</a></i> is his first non-fiction book.</p>\n<p>Ostensibly about whisky (more specifically single malts), it is part-autobiography, part-travelogue of Scotland (with a brief dip down to Chester) and a lot about cars and driving.  Rather too much about cars and driving, in my opinion; though it does celebrate Scottish country roads as the best places to drive, which agrees with my own experience and opinion.</p>\n<p>And the war, of course: he started doing the research (ie driving around Scotland visiting distilleries and buying whiskies: it‚Äôs a hard life as a writer) just as the war was starting, so its events were the constant backdrop to his travels, and he periodically brings them into the foreground.  It won‚Äôt come as a surprise to many to hear that his attitude is strongly against the war.  In fact he started his first trip the day he and his wife cut up their passports (which event I may have drawn your attention to before).  </p>\n<p>It‚Äôs interesting to see that, even when writing non-fiction, Banksie plays the same sort of structural games as in, for example, <i>The Crow Road</i>: he jumps around in time, principally; but it is never hard to follow. </p>\n<p>It does, however, show a degree of hurry and under-editing in places; I suspect it was rushed out for the Christmas market, and there are one or two paces where gaps haven‚Äôt been properly joined.  The most notable of these for me concerns the apparatus of distilling.  Banks gives us a brief overview of the steps in the distilling process, fairly early on, and then makes appropriate use of the various technical terms during later distillery visits.  All fair enough.  But there is one term for part of distillery‚Äôs apparatus ‚Äî the <a href=\"http://www.whiskymag.com/words/lyne_arm.html\">lyne arm</a> ‚Äî that he starts referring to without ever explaining what it is (I‚Äôm fairly sure: it is possible that I just missed that explanation, but I don‚Äôt think so). </p>\n<p>However, that relatively small matter aside, it‚Äôs a fun read, especially if you like whisky: though as I said above, it‚Äôs about a lot more than whisky.  This book will be good for the Scottish economy, I predict: it has already made me drink more whisky, and I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt be alone.</p>\n<p>How I came to get a copy is mildly amusing.  I heard about it because they were trailing it as <i>Book of the Week</i> on Radio 4.  Then I saw it in a shop and confirmed that it was by <em>the</em> Iain Banks, but didn‚Äôt buy it because Christmas is approaching.</p>\n<p>Then we had my team‚Äôs Christmas meal at work, and we did one of those ‚ÄòSecret Santa‚Äô things.  And my present was‚Ä¶ <i>Raw Spirit</i>!  Awesome.</p>\n<p>And one last anecdote.  In the unlikely event that anybody will be concerned about spoilers for the ‚Äòsearch‚Äô in the subtitle, I‚Äôll put it behind a cut.</p>\n<p><!--more--><br>\nBanksie‚Äôs conclusion is, unsurprisingly, that there is no perfect dram, and one person‚Äôs favourite will not necessarily be another‚Äôs.  However, he does give some opinions.</p>\n<p>Probably the one he likes most of all on his travels is straight from a cask at the Ardbeg distillery on Islay.  Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a one-off and all the bottles are already spoken for, so it doesn‚Äôt really count.  His favourite of all the ones you can actually get turns out to be <a href=\"http://range.glenfiddich-whisky.co.uk/havana-reserve/\">Glenfiddich‚Äôs twenty-one-year-old Havana Reserve</a>.  It is aged in Cuban rum barrels.  This makes it illegal in the USA, and so leaves more for the rest of us.</p>\n<p>So I was on a work trip to Luxembourg a few days ago, and obviously stopped in at the airport shop on the way back.  They have an astonishingly fine array of whiskies.  And there, right at the end, along with the other Glenfiddichs: Havana Reserve.</p>\n<p>A quick phone call (international roaming is a fine thing): ‚ÄúFrances, what do you think of me spending 68 Euros on a bottle of whisky? ‚Ä¶ OK, you‚Äôll get it for me for Christmas, then?  Great.‚Äù </p>\n<p>And so it awaits me under the tree.  I‚Äôll report back on Boxing Day (or thereabouts).</p>\n</body></html>\n",

When he pretended he though the bullet was in chamber five and aimed down the room and we heard the <em>click</em>; the few minutes of silent anticipation that followed seemed like hours, and had me on the edge of my seat.</p>\n<p>This despite the fact that I was (and am) sceptical about the possibility that he could come to any harm.  I don‚Äôt know how (any more than I know how that Copperfield guy flew a couple of hours later (this should include a link to Channel 4‚Ä≤s ‚ÄòTop Fifty Magic Tricks‚Äô, but I can‚Äôt find it on their site)), but I‚Äôm sure there was no way he could possibly have blown his brains out.</p>\n<p>The strange thing for me was that, since he showed right at the start, with the cup game, essentially how he was going to work out which was the deadly chamber; and since it was clear in that cup game example that the guy hesitated slightly before he said the number of the cup in question; I expected to be able to tell which chamber held the bullet.</p>\n<p>However, they guy who loaded the gun (James?) was so nervous that he raced through counting one to six, with only, I thought, a slight hesitation on six.</p>\n<p>But he‚Äôd loaded chamber one.</p>\n<p>Is it just me, or does anyone else think that‚Äôs an incredibly weird number to choose?  My mind was screaming ‚Äúfour‚Äù, but that‚Äôs probably because it was cup four in the cup game earlier.  But to put the bullet in the first chamber.  I don‚Äôt know: what if Brown had decided just to start at the bottom?</p>\n<p>More significantly, how did Brown catch the hesitation in James‚Äôs voice when it must have come on the first number spoken?  Make it hard for the guy, why don‚Äôt you, Jimmy.</p>\n<p>And what does watching that kind of spectacle do to us as viewers, to television as a medium?  In Saturday‚Äôs  <i><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/\">Guardian</a></i>, Mark Lawson route about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1055685,00.html\">potential death as media spectacle</a>, saying:<br>\n</p><blockquote>Our culture is now so tricked out with smoke and mirrors that were Brown to fall to the studio floor under a gunpowder cloud ‚Äì or, indeed, if David Blaine was carried out of his glass box in a wooden one ‚Äì we could not be certain that we were really seeing what we thought we saw. In the spun world, the illusionist just joins a queue behind the politicians and other tricksters. In such an environment of lies and winks, the media need to set rules of truthfulness and keep to them.\n<p>If Brown really is risking his life tomorrow night, then it‚Äôs a moment of landmark depravity for television. But, if he really isn‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs a lesser but still terrible offence against the integrity of the medium. </p></blockquote>\n<p>And now I find that in today‚Äôs, he points out the twistedness of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1056879,00.html\">David Kelly/Samaritans/Russian Roulette</a> segue.

It‚Äôs all legal and above board: the artists get royalties per download, and all in all it seems like a fine model for how music can be distributed.</p>\n<p>Obviously not every artist on the planet is going to be on there, so it can be kind of disappointing sometimes.  However, the kind of artist that is there (in my brief study of the matter) is kind of off the wall, left field stuff that maybe doesn‚Äôt get major mainstream distribution.  The sort of stuff I tend to like, in other words.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I have no problems using Mozilla at their site, and their download manager is available for Linux as well as Windows.  They just <em>get it</em>, I thought.</p>\n<p>So I just started a trial subscription period: fourteen days, fifty files.  Plenty to choose from, and it‚Äôs all going very well.</p>\n<p>Or it was, until I started seeing this message appear alongside some albums: <i>Not available outside North America due to licensing restrictions</i>.</p>\n<p>And this is alongside, for example, <a href=\"http://aasearch.emusic.com/aasearch?rtype=search_art&amp;searchterm=the+birthday+party&amp;cid=emusic&amp;imageField.x=0&amp;imageField.y=0\">everything they have by The Birthday Party</a>.

It‚Äôs been a bugbear for a long time, and it‚Äôs time to put it out there.)</p>\n<p>Anyone who bought records during the eighties and probably early nineties, at least in the UK, will be familiar with the propaganda I‚Äôm referring to there.  At some point during those years, the record companies, in their wisdom, decided that the common practice of people making tape copies of their friends‚Äô records (or records borrowed from libraries) was seriously eating into their profits, and had to be stamped out.<br>\n<!--more--></p>\n<h3>Hoist the Joyless Roger</h3>\n<p>Part of their programme to achieve this aim was the printing, on all album inner sleeves that didn‚Äôt have pictures or lyrics, of the slogan ‚ÄúHome taping is killing music‚Äù above a large skull-and-crossbones with the skull formed from the silhouette of a cassette.  Below this device was the text, ‚Äúand it‚Äôs illegal‚Äù.  You can see a reproduction of it <a href=\"http://www.stunned.org/mt/archives/000015.html\">here</a></p>\n<p>Obviously, when first the young, would-be home taper saw this, they immediately gave up their nefarious acivities, destroyed any tapes they had already made, and went out and bought all the albums they had taped.</p>\n<p>Oh no.  Sorry: that was just in the dreamworld of the record company executives.</p>\n<p>Is any of this ‚Äî even if you‚Äôre too young to remember those days ‚Äî starting to sound vaguely similar to events in our present (and more recent past)?</p>\n<p>The parallels with MP3 sharing are undeniable; but are the conclusions the same?</p>\n<h3>Divided but undimmed</h3>\n<p>Before I consider that, let me just say why I think home taping was/is good for music.</p>\n<p>The fundamental point that the record companies never got, I think, was that records taped <em>were not lost sales</em>.  Taping was always a poor second-best to having the record.  I speak here from the point of view of a teenager at school, of a student, of a young adult on the dole: mostly we taped records that we wanted to hear or have, <em>that we couldn‚Äôt afford to buy</em>.</p>\n<p>Imagine, for a moment, that taping had never existed: that records had been released, but that there was no technology available to individuals that would allow a copy to be made.  Would we ‚Äî would <em>I</em> ‚Äî have bought all the albums that, in reality, I taped?</p>\n<p>I think it‚Äôs easy to see that the answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I might have <em>wanted</em> to, of course; but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd ever have been able to afford to.</p>\n<p>So I, and thousands ‚Äî maybe millions ‚Äî like me, made tapes.  And in doing so, I got to know the music of the bands I liked.  And what do you do if you like, say, a band‚Äôs first two albums, which you have on tape, when their third album comes out?</p>\n<p>You buy it on record, of course.</p>\n<p>Especially if, by that time you are working and generally financially better off.  This is exactly what happened to me with, for example, The Pogues.  I heard them on John Peel, taped the first two albums (from <lj user=\"swisstone\">, as it happens) and gradually fell in love with them.</lj></p>\n<p>Then when their third album came out, I bought it.  Same with their fourth and fifth.</p>\n<h3>Make the switch</h3>\n<p>But it gets better than that, as far as the long-term income for the band (and record company) is concerned (or at least it did during the years of vinyl‚Äôs fading and aluminium‚Äôs growth).  Because tapes degrade; after a few years of heavy use, they sound shite, quite frankly.  But of qcourse, the music they hold doesn‚Äôt; our love for the songs doesn‚Äôt.</p>\n<p>Sooner or later you need replacements.</p>\n<p>This is why I have the first two Pogues albums on CD and the remainder on vinyl.  Same with others.  Or take The Fall: I have a mixture of vinyl and CD, and a still incomplete collection.  Keep them out there, the record companies, and eventually I‚Äôll buy the missing ones.  On CD, almost certainly.</p>\n<p>I am, of course, a trivial statistical sample; but I strongly suspect that I‚Äôm a long way from unrepresentative.</p>\n<p>So my conclusion is that my taping activities didn‚Äôt deprive the artists or record companies of any sales; and <em>did</em> prepare me to buy the material later.  A net gain for artists and record companies.  And for me, for that matter: a no-lose situation.</p>\n<h3>It‚Äôs got to be perfect</h3>\n<p>But things have changed ‚Äî or they might have at least.  Nowadays you can borrow a CD and make a CD copy of it: a bit-perfect, nondegrading copy (on the assumption that CDR doesn‚Äôt degrade, which is another story entirely).  Or you can rip it to your hard drive.  The MP3 encoding is of a lower quality than CD, of course, but most of us, most of the time, probably can‚Äôt tell the difference; and if it doesn‚Äôt bother you ‚Äî or once you get used to it ‚Äî again, there‚Äôs no deterioration.</p>\n<p>This all, I must admit, bothers me.</p>\n<p>Clearly there‚Äôs no problem with ripping your own CDs, for convenient playback.  Ripping, or copying, borrowed ones, though: there‚Äôs the rub.</p>\n<p>Because it completely blows my repacement theory out of the water, doesn‚Äôt it?  You‚Äôll never replace your copied CD, because it‚Äôll never become muffled and stretched like a tape.</p>\n<h3>Rip it up and start again</h3>\n<p>Well‚Ä¶ I can think of a couple of occasions where you might go back and buy a copied or ripped CD.  One is to get the packaging.  A not completely unreasonable possibility; many albums are attractively packaged, with lyrics, sleevenotes, and so on.  But in equally many, even ones that contain glorious, deathless music, the packaging is at best an irrelevance (and I‚Äôve long felt that twelve-inch vinyl records are better to own <em>as artifacts</em> than CDs anyway; not least because of the bettter printing quality on the bigger covers).</p>\n<p>The second is when you‚Äôve ripped it and you lose the ripped files through a disk crash or similar (in conjunction with poor backup discipline, of course).  Indeed, there is a growing belief or acceptance that ‚Äúthe CD is your master copy‚Äù while your working copy resides on your hard drive, or in your iPod or whatever.</p>\n<p>So, it‚Äôs not impossible that we may go on to buy a once-borrowed CD.  But I think it‚Äôs a lot less likely than it was with tapes.</p>\n<p>So where do I stand on copying CDs?  is home duplication killing music?  Well, no: it‚Äôs clearly not as bad as that.  I‚Äôm not totally comfortable with duplication, so I rarely do it.  The fact that people out there will, however, doesn‚Äôt mean that the whole edifice of the music industry is going to come crashing down any time soon.</p>\n<h3>Stay tuned for more rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll</h3>\n<p>Indeed, the other side of the digital music revolution probably balances out the problem of making copies: downloading.  The record companies don‚Äôt get this yet,of course, but on the whole I think even they will have to admit that downloading is good for music.</p>\n<p>This argument has been discussed to death on the net, so I can hardly bear to write it, but in a nutshell: you dowload ‚Äî legally or not ‚Äî a few tracks by an artist; if you don‚Äôt like them you never listem to them again and/or you delete them to save space.  If you like them, you go out and buy the album.  It‚Äôs as simple as that.</p>\n<p>OK, there are alway exceptions.  There are no doubt people who‚Äôll be prepared to take the time to download entire albums; but they‚Äôre surely in the minority.  For most people the download model will, or does, work broadly as I‚Äôve outlined it above.</p>\n<p>Also, I‚Äôm fairly sure that most people will be willing to pay a small fee to download tracks, once a suitable payment mechanism is found.  So all in all music-downloading culture is good for music ‚Äî especially, of course, for the smaller artist without big record-company backing.</p>\n<p>All of this has been said before, and will be said again (for example, <a href=\"http://www.netmusicians.org/mp3_death/Mp3_death.htm\">this guy</a> presents a good discussion of it); we‚Äôll have to keep saying it, I suppose, until the record companies listen ‚Äî or until they just go away and leave bands to get on with doing it themselves.<br>\n</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Hadn‚Äôt been to Eastercon ‚Äî hadn‚Äôt been to a con yet: RaCon was later, I think; and anyway, a good Catholic boy like me had been at home with his parents, going to midnight mass and all that.</p>\n<p>However I had got into SF fandom, via the <a href=\"http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/sesoc\">EU SFSoc</a> (of which I was later President, for what it‚Äôs worth).  Had started making several of my closest friends, whom I‚Äôm don‚Äôt stay in nearly close enough touch with these days.  Must have seen the Architects of Fear (seminal Edinburgh punk band, without whom <a href=\"http://livejournal.com/users/tickettothewest\">Burn</a> would probably not exist) a few times by then.  It was through SF Soc that I met <lj user=\"swisstone\"> and, indirectly, because they were a bit after my time, </lj><lj user=\"karmicnull\"> and Ol (my turn to say, ‚ÄúGet an LJ, mate‚Äù).</lj></p>\n<p><strong>15 years ago:</strong> I had started work in London the previous August (and  had a long-weekend trip to Brighton for reasons many of you will remember, if vaguely).   Exactly fifteen years ago I had probably recently returned from Follycon.  I was living in Tooting with some members of a band called The <a href=\"http://www.mp3.com/pleasurethieves\">Pleasure Thieves</a> ‚Äî they had some fine songs which I remember fondly (so I was pleased to find, while researching this, that they‚Äôve put a lot of them out via MP3.com).</p>\n<p>Also in the same house was their <a href=\"http://www.thegliders.co.uk/biog.html#Andy\">recently-left singer</a>. He left because the other band that he was involved with had recently got a deal.  Tensions were high, but largely unspoken.  The Jazz Devils put out a couple of albums on Virgin, but they had never played a gig before they got their deal so they had no following.</p>\n<p>The Pleasure Thieves regrouped as a three-piece and gigged heavily over the next couple of years.  I sometimes helped them out with a bit of roadieing.</p>\n<p>Later that year I bought a house in Walthamstow with two friends called John (if any of these people had sites I‚Äôd link to them).  Big mistake financially, given what was to follow, but we had a fun few years including putting a band together for a bit.  Never got past the rehearsal-room stage, though.  In fact, we never even settled on a name.  We tried out many, with The Void being the last and longest-serving, but we were never very happy with it.</p>\n<p>I wonder now whether we‚Äôd have done more if we‚Äôd had a name.</p>\n<p><strong>10 years ago:</strong> still in Walthamstow, but by this time the house-partnership was sundering ‚Äî amicably enough: it was all to do with other relationships starting.  By this time I had met and was going out with Frances, (whom I‚Äôve been with ever since), so I was spending a lot of time in Hackney, too.</p>\n<p><strong>5 years ago:</strong> Daniel, our son, was 1.  Living in Hackney, commuting to Wimbledon.  Holidayed in Normandy, on a farm where there was a donkey which Daniel loved at first, but then got frightened of when it charged down the hill braying loudly (safely behind a fence, I should add).  I had hardly touched my guitar in several years, but Burn were in the near future.</p>\n<p><strong>Last year:</strong> Fiona, our daughter, was 1.  We were starting,very gradually, to get the house done up, a long-term project.  I had been in Burn for four years, I think.  Holiday in France again, camping in the Loire Valley this time.  No donkeys seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Yesterday:</strong> At work: tail end of Meridian 4 development (soon to be shelved as we redevelop it using EJBs ‚Äî though that release will probably still be numbered 4).  Collected kids, Frances working late.</p>\n<p><strong>Today:</strong> At work again; more of the same.  band rehearsal at Ol‚Äôs tonight: mmm, pizza, beer.</p>\n<p><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> It‚Äôs the working week, what do <em>you</em>. think?  Don‚Äôt expect the Mayday celebraions to affect me much, though work have warned us to be careful, ‚Äúto avoid accidental involvement in violence‚Äù.  Yeah, but what about deliberate involvement?</p>\n<p><strong>Next year:</strong> should repeat this, to build up a year-by-year picture.</p>\n<p></p>\n</body></html>\n",

But I have been scattering comments around various people‚Äôs journals, at least.</p>\n<p>Zotz <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=zotz&amp;itemid=66143\">posts</a> about The (remaining members of the) MC5 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,912932,00.html\">playing a Levis-sponsored gig</a>.  I have to say that I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about this.  I know I <em>ought</em> to feel upset that they‚Äôve ‚Äòsold out‚Äô but I just can‚Äôt seem to get up the ire.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I‚Äôve become too accepting of the capitalist society in which we live.  But it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre being sponsored by a weapons manufacturer ‚Äî or even McDonald‚Äôs or Nestl√©, for that matter.</p>\n<p>Not that Levis are likely to be angels, but I just wonder whether we should cut the MC5 some slack: why should we hold them to a higher standard than we hold ourselves? (and we all work for corporations or governments, ultimately, don‚Äôt we?)</p>\n<p>At this point, though, I worry that I may be contradicting the spirit of <a href=\"http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.mccallion/pieces/vote.html\"> something I wrote a few years ago </a>, just prior to the 1997 UK General Election.  in essence, there, I said that becoming a parent hadn‚Äôt made me more conservative, but if anything politically the opposite.  This relative acceptance of selling out to corporate interests could easily be perceived as a step in the conservative direction.  And maybe that‚Äôs so.  But from where I‚Äôm sitting, it‚Äôs not me that‚Äôs changed, but everything else.</p>\n<p>That sounds horribly solipsistic, but the political landscape <em> has </em> changed a lot in this country in the last five or six years.  Though, if everything has moved right, that should leave the good Marx-fearing socialist<sup><a href=\"#PoliticsFoot1\">*</a> </sup> appearing to be even further left: unless they have been dragged with it.</p>\n<p>Which means my parenthood piece‚Äôs assertion is contradicted; but it‚Äôs not because of parenthood.  The question I have to consider is whether I <em>want</em> to be dragged around by society.</p>\n<p>I should just add at this point that I feel that I was in no way moved to the right by the supposed move right of society during the Thatcher years.  Obviously it takes a ‚ÄòLabour‚Äô government to do that.</p>\n<p>Then at the same time, Karmicnull <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=karmicnull&amp;itemid=7836\">tells us</a> that Warner Hodges out of <a href=\"http://www.jasonandthescorchers.com/\">Jason and the Scorchers</a> has formed a <a href=\"http://www.disciplesofloud.com/\">new band</a>.  This is a surprise, because I thought that a) he‚Äôd quit the music business, saying he didn‚Äôt really enjoy making music, and b) there had been a Scorchers tour planned, which was still sort of in a state of ‚Äòmight one day come to fruition‚Äô if he ever did come back to it.</p>\n<p>Still, people change (and moving ones do too); so what seemed right once may no longer seem so (and of course, having one band doesn‚Äôt preclude the possibility of playing in another; just ask Blixa Bargeld, for example).</p>\n<p>The common theme here seems to be, ‚Äòpeople change‚Äô.  And in direct opposition to almost everything anyone ever says about that subject, I <em>like</em> change.  Life is change: if you‚Äôve stopped changing, you‚Äôre dead.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><small><br>\n<a name=\"PoliticsFoot1\" id=\"PoliticsFoot1\"><sup>*</sup></a> This is irony.<br>\n</small></p>\n</body></html>\n",

But on the whole I do.  I‚Äôve had my ups and downs, of course, but I wouldn‚Äôt have stayed there for fifteen years, through name changes and takeovers, reshuffles and redundancies, if it wasn‚Äôt a reasonable place to work; and I wouldn‚Äôt have gone into that area, and stayed in it ‚Äî not to mention resisted all inducements to move into management ‚Äî if I didn‚Äôt like the work.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm a programmer, which, in my humble opinion and personal mythology, is the third best job in the world (and I do the top two in my spare time anyway: see my bio).  So when, some fifeen years ago, the precursor of the company that I now work for offered me a trainee programmer job, I, having been on the dole for a year since graduating, was delighted.  Not only was I starting a programming job, but also I was moving to London, which, despite burning with boredom, had been calling to my faraway town for a long time.</p>\n<p>My personal graph of contendedness and the ups and downs of the job market combined to ensure that I stayed there ever since.  I have occasionally looked around for another job, but never quite got round to moving.  At the time when I was furthest down that line, for example, I was offered a move to a more interesting role, so I stayed.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of last year, senior management announced the latest round of redundancies (I wrote a blog piece about it, which, for various reasons, I never posted).  That safely behind them, they feel they have to justify their existence by doing the latest spot of restructuring.</p>\n<p>The division I work in is being split into three independent (allegedly autonomous) operating companies.  This comes some eighteen months after all the prior companies (the group grew by acquisition) were renamed and rebranded under the group name and logo.</p>\n<p>Both the rebranding and now the split can be seen as good decisions in business terms, and there are some aspects of the latest split that seem positive from where I‚Äôm sitting.  But here‚Äôs the rub.  Each of the new companies is to have its own HR and Finance departments.</p>\n<p>Now, I‚Äôm sure if you asked the board they would tell you that they had no plans to sell off any of the companies; and they probably wouldn‚Äôt even be lying; but could it be any plainer that they‚Äôre positioning things such that they easily <em>can</em> sell off the various bits if they‚Äôre seen to be performing poorly?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the company in which I am to find myself has announced the following facts (among others):</p>\n<ul>\n<li> it‚Äôs going to become a nicer place to work </li>\n<li> they‚Äôre going to tighten up on the dress code </li>\n<li> they‚Äôre going to tighten up on timekeeping (which had, over years, become informally flexible) and definitely <em>not</em> introduce flexitime </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I invite the reader to join me in musing about the incompatibilities in the above statements.</p>\n<p>Oh yes: and they‚Äôre going to improve communications; but they announced all the above without the vaguest hint of consultation with the staff.  No, wait, this is management-speak: ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù means ‚ÄúWe will communicate at you‚Äù.</p>\n<p>And on that note, all this is being badged the ‚ÄúStep-Change Program‚Äù.  Now I don‚Äôt know about you, but to me a step-change sounds like quite a small thing; like a stepper-motor in electronics, maybe, or just the first steps of a child.  Apparently not to management.  In management-speak, our new boss (same as the boss before the current one, as it happens) tells us, ‚Äústep‚Äù means ‚Äúhuge‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Do what you want with the company, guys: but give us our language back.</p>\n<hr>\n<sup><a name=\"2002-02-26foot1\" id=\"step-change-foot1\">*</a></sup> Or is it?

And spent the next hour playing with gain and EQ controls until we had it right.  Karmic is nothing if not a perfectionist, and I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll thank him for it when we hear the final results.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we were able to use the same sound for the third song, ‚ÄòCowboys and Indians‚Äô, and it went down without too much fuss, leaving us only to choose a suitable clean sound for ‚ÄòWhite Line‚Äô.  That didn‚Äôt take too long,and before the night was out Ol, the lead guitarist (and sole non-LJ user in the band, I might add) had done his rhythm part on the last song.</p>\n<p>The next day he did all his other rhythm parts, and in the afternoon I started singing.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs when we discovered all the parts in the songs where I had been getting it wrong up until now.  I didn‚Äôt write any of the songs we‚Äôre recording at the moment, so there‚Äôs always someone else to know what I‚Äôm doing wrong (in many ways this makes it easier for me than doing my own songs, when there‚Äôs only me who knows what I should be singing); however, it‚Äôs not always easy to catch such things in a rehearsal when everyone is playing.</p>\n<p>Still, as <lj user=\"zotz\"> said, taking two hours to record the entire lead vocal for a track is not, in the grand scheme of things, that much.</lj></p>\n<p>In the end, though, we only managed to finish three of the four tracks before we all had to go home, so ‚ÄòNaples‚Äô remains undone as yet.</p>\n<p>And in the middle of all that we heard the tragic news about <i>Columbia</i>.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I was cycling to Waterloo this morning, on my brand-new, four-month old <a href=\"http://www.ridgebackbikes.co.uk/\">Ridgeback</a> bike, when all of a sudden something began to drag badly on the back wheel.  I got off, had a good look, up-ended it, and saw that the tyre was rubbing against the mudguard bracket, once per turn.</p>\n<p>I tried slackening the wheel and re-seating it, but that didn‚Äôt help.  The mudguard bracket wasn‚Äôt bent or anything.  I gradually realised that the wheel was out of true.</p>\n<p>But it had happened in an instant; I had heard the change, just as I went over a speed bump.  Surely wheels only get warped over a long period of time?</p>\n<p>A few more minutes of examination revealed the culprit: a spoke had broken.  The careful balance of tension that makes a bike wheel the perfect, dynamically stable circle that it is, had gone, throwing all out of alignment.  I feel there should be some sort of metaphor here, perhaps for world affairs; but this isn‚Äôt <i>Thought for the Day</i>.</p>\n<p>So I was left to take it easy the rest of the way to Waterloo,  and I‚Äôll have to struggle home somehow.</p>\n<p>Fortunately (I suppose) the bike is overdue for its first free service, so I‚Äôll take it into <a href=\"http://www.londonfieldscycles.co.uk/\">the shop</a> and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll sort it out.  But after only four months?  It‚Äôs very disappointing.  It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs seen very heavy use: twelve miles a day on only two or three days a week on average, and I didn‚Äôt use it at all in December.</p>\n<p>And it would have to happen <i>this</i> week, when the Central and Waterloo &amp; City Lines are fracked because of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/leaders/story/0,3604,883586,00.html\">crash</a>.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Just how true this is was brought home to me anew when it crossed my mind that I had, a while ago, been thinking about writing a piece with a similar title to the above.</p>\n<p>Then I realised that I had been thinking about it around <i>last</i> New Year.  Yet it felt to me like it had been no more than a few weeks before.</p>\n<p>Then on Radio 4‚Ä≤s <i>Today</i> program, before I left for work this morning, they were doing a piece on time-saving devices, and how some people think that they don‚Äôt save us time, but merely free us to waste it in new ways.  And how we‚Äôve lost the sense of <strong>process</strong>.</p>\n<p>To paraphrase:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We travel only to be at our destination, not to experience the journey; we treat food as something to eat, not something to cook; we wash merely to have clean clothes or dishes, not to get them clean.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which is all very well, but what exactly is the problem with that?   Especially in the case of the last point: I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúDamn right‚Äù to that one  The single best household good we ever bought was the dishwasher.</p>\n<p>As for travelling, well <strong> of course </strong> we do it to be at the other place.  For example, I went to <lj user=\"karmicnull\">‚Äòs with Frances and the kids for New Year, and the purpose of the travelling was only so that we could be with our friends.  If I could have stepped onto a transporter platform and beamed there in an instant I‚Äôd certainly have done so in preference to experiencing the dubious pleasures of the rain-drenched M11.</lj></p>\n<p>On the other hand, I do enjoy cooking, but what with work and kids and <nobr><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=tickettothewest\"><img height=\"17\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" width=\"17\"></a><b><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/tickettothewest/\">band</a></b></nobr> there‚Äôs little enough time for home life.  And at the same time, it‚Äôs slightly ironic that they should run that piece just a week after many if not most people in the country have spent a day cooking (or helping to cook) the biggest meal of the year.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs a thought: if, on Christmas Day, you could press a button and instantly have a classic Christmas dinner ready, with no preparations and no cooking, would you?  I think I probably wouldn‚Äôt.  Because part of the whole Christmas experience is the preparation and cooking.</p>\n<p>Though I would certainly use such a magic button at other times‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>With the year-change bringing thoughts of time, the other time-related quote I was thinking of using as a title was, ‚ÄúTime takes a cigarette‚Äù, from Bowie‚Äôs<br>\n‚ÄòRock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Suicide‚Äô.  Then what do they go and use as part of the backing for the Radio 4 piece?  Plagiarists!</p>\n<p>It was an interesting piece, though, and I would have liked to listen to all of it; but I was already late leaving, and so (of course) I didn‚Äôt have time.</p>\n<p>And last year‚Äôs piece?  Inevitably I never found the time to write it.</p>\n<p>\nIn a nice touch of real-world LiveJournal linking, just after the year turned at Si‚Äôs, we got a phone call from <lj user=\"swisstone\">.

On leaving work I noticed what I thought was one of the many casual misspellings that haunt our public spaces.  In this case it was on a London Borough of Merton electronic noticeboard by Wimbledon station.  ‚ÄúRun with the Wimbledon Windmilers‚Äù, it said, and I wondered whether it was a pun on the distance they run.  Wimbledon has a windmill, though, and I somehow doubted that members of an athletic organisation would be that keen on wordplay.  A quick websearch showed me that <a href=\"http://www.windmilers.org.uk/\">I was wrong</a>, though.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I imagined a literate member of the organisation complaining about it to their colleagues, and being told, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter: it‚Äôs only a word‚Äù.</p>\n<p>But it‚Äôs their name.  And names matter.  Words matter (the fact that I was mistaken, and there was no misspelling doesn‚Äôt matter, for the sake of this argument).</p>\n<p>So when <strong>should</strong> we let the Saatchis ‚Äî or at least their name ‚Äî back into polite society?  It‚Äôs hard to say; and not an immediately pressing matter, as I have no particular desire to visit their gallery, nor a need for an ad agency.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not like that first time I bought South African wine after apartheid ended.  That was both difficult, and positive.  Difficult because I had developed such an ingrained reaction against South African goods; and positive because I could feel I was supporting the new regime.</p>\n<p>That, of course, was several orders of magnitude more significant than the doings of a seedy little political party and their advertising lapdogs (hmm, I wonder whether the lapdog relationship was actually the other way round?)</p>\n<p>I suppose, though, if it comes to making the decision, I should ask myself, ‚ÄúWhat would Iain Banks do?‚Äù</p>\n<p><font size=\"-1\"><br>\n<a name=\"foot1\">[1]</a> Though I have to admit to doubting my memory when I find that Google can find no record of this event, either on the web or on Usenet.

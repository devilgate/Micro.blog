Still, this would be wholly different, not least because of it being on a giant screen.</p><p>Which was true enough. That screen is almost too big, certainly when you're sitting in row G and there's a closeup: Timothée Chalamet's face shouldn't be gigantic! Luckily there weren't too many of those occasions.</p><p>More to the point, this a spectacular movie, in the literal sense: it's all about the spectacle. And there's plenty of that. Battles, explosions, sandworms, duels.</p><p>And it's all a bit… not that good really, I thought. I liked parts of it. But really disliked the overall narrative arc. As I said last time, I remember the book hardly at all. So the transition of Paul Atriedes from teen duke trying to find his way with the Fremen, to world leader and messiah figure challenging the galactic emperor himself? Frankly, I don't buy it, and I didn't like it.</p><p>My favourite moment was Chani (Zendaya) turning away and walking out when everyone else bowed down to him. In fact in acting terms Zendaya is the best thing about this film. She can express so much just with her face, it was incredible.</p><p>Of course that ability might have been exaggerated by her face being the size of a bus, but no one else was doing that.</p><p>The worst thing about it in a ways was that it didn't feel like the end brought us to a conclusion. It felt like the middle volume of a trilogy. And I'm quite sure the original book didn't feel like that. I know there are several sequels, but I don't believe it was written as the start of a series. It was a self-contained work.</p><p>In fact I started the second one, <cite>Dune Messiah</cite> (and yes, that title should have given me some clues to the above complaints) all those years ago, and couldn't get into it. Didn't finish it.</p><p>The odd thing about all this is that it makes me slightly want to go back and read the book (and maybe carry on this time).</p><p>Anyway, there we are. There had do be someone who didn't think it's the best thing since freshly-baked baguette.</p>\n",

But it would have been better — the conversation afterwards in particular — if the the first twenty minutes and the last five were shaved off.</p><p>The first twenty minutes because, we know: Oxford is shit if you have no friends and no money; and it's better if you have both. We don't need it explained in elaborate detail.</p><p>Or maybe that's not so obvious. I have some insider knowledge there.</p><p>But the last five or so minutes. I mean, really? Do you have to explain everything? Spell everything out in minute detail? Confirm that every possible thing that we thought might have happened — but that was, until now, pleasingly ambiguous — had actually happened?</p><p>I feel like the ending was focus-grouped to death; a few people didn't understand, so they dropped in some tiny flashbacks. Yes, he <em>was</em> that manipulative. I had suspected that from about forty minutes in, and my suspicions only increased.

It was good to give the leaving and arriving Doctors the chance to interact, and a Doctor ending without it being a death was good.</p>\n<p>However, let us speak of the extension of that effect, as explained in <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/doctor-who-bigeneration-doctorverse-newsupdate/\">this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Radio Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article</a>.

But this &lsquo;every Doctor is now bi-generated&rsquo; idea just seems like it leaves things in a mess.</p>\n<p>Sure, you can explain it all away with branching timelines, alternative realities and all that. But it all just seems a bit too chaotic, you know? Even if they never use it, it feels unnecessary.</p>\n<p>And then there&rsquo;s this idea of making an expanded &lsquo;Whoniverse&rsquo;, in the vein of what Marvel and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have become. Disney&rsquo;s money is going to allow this, presumably. More shows, even, than when we had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Torchwood<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sarah Jane Adventures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>Trouble is, from my point of view, that I&rsquo;ve lost interest in both <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Marvel exactly because there&rsquo;s <em>so much stuff</em>. It&rsquo;s all just too much.</p>\n<p>So I hope my favourite programme doesn&rsquo;t go the same way.

My favourite of the three — and I think probably the best, too — was the middle one, 'Wild Blue Yonder'.\n\nAs to the ending, the 'bi-generation' thing was daft, but fun. It was good to give the leaving and arriving Doctors the chance to interact, and a Doctor ending without it being a death was good.\n\nHowever, let us speak of the extension of that effect, as explained in [this <cite>Radio Times</cite> article](https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/doctor-who-bigeneration-doctorverse-newsupdate/). I was directed there by [@BenSouthwood](https://micro.blog/BenSouthwood), via a [conversation on Micro.blog](https://bensouthwood.me/2023/12/09/doctor-who-was.html).\n\nAs I said there, I loved the idea of the Timeless Child, and the expansion it brought to The Doctor's past and the prehistory of the Time Lords. But this 'every Doctor is now bi-generated' idea just seems like it leaves things in a mess.\n\nSure, you can explain it all away with branching timelines, alternative realities and all that. But it all just seems a bit too chaotic, you know? Even if they never use it, it feels unnecessary.\n\nAnd then there's this idea of making an expanded 'Whoniverse', in the vein of what Marvel and <cite>Star Wars</cite> have become. Disney's money is going to allow this, presumably. More shows, even, than when we had <cite>Torchwood</cite> and <cite>The Sarah Jane Adventures</cite>.\n\nTrouble is, from my point of view, that I've lost interest in both <cite>Star Wars</cite> and Marvel exactly because there's _so much stuff_. It's all just too much.\n\nSo I hope my favourite programme doesn't go the same way. Or at least, if it does, that the original programme will always remain at the hearts of the franchise, and not depend on any of the expansion packs.\n",

What was the point of writing that, and why did you leave it where you did?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>However, I recognise the skill that it takes to conjure a life, a character, in few words. And Saunders makes good use of that ability here. Because the story is not very much about Abraham Lincoln. It&rsquo;s not even that much about his son, Willie, who is the one who is actually in the &lsquo;bardo&rsquo;, a place where souls wait after death in some schools of Buddhism. Rather, it&rsquo;s about some of the other souls that are trapped in the same Washington graveyard. We get a whole host of compressed backstories.</p>\n<p>And we get altogether too many quotes from books and articles about Lincoln and the death of his son. I haven&rsquo;t investigated to see whether these are from actual Lincoln biographies, histories of the American Civil War, and so on, or they are cleverly invented by Saunders. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_in_the_Bardo\">This Wikipedia article suggests it&rsquo;s a mixture</a>.) But I found them much less interesting than the stories of the dead souls.

Often, when I read a short story — even, or perhaps especially, by one of the supposed greats of of the form: Carver, Hemingway, even Chekhov — I'm left thinking, 'So what? What was the point of writing that, and why did you leave it where you did?'\n\nHowever, I recognise the skill that it takes to conjure a life, a character, in few words. And Saunders makes good use of that ability here. Because the story is not very much about Abraham Lincoln. It's not even that much about his son, Willie, who is the one who is actually in the 'bardo', a place where souls wait after death in some schools of Buddhism. Rather, it's about some of the other souls that are trapped in the same Washington graveyard. We get a whole host of compressed backstories.\n\nAnd we get altogether too many quotes from books and articles about Lincoln and the death of his son. I haven't investigated to see whether these are from actual Lincoln biographies, histories of the American Civil War, and so on, or they are cleverly invented by Saunders. ([This Wikipedia article suggests it's a mixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_in_the_Bardo).) But I found them much less interesting than the stories of the dead souls. A few would have been fine, for background, but it feels like they make up about half the book.\n\nMore stories about the dead, please.\n",

I had the vague impression, since I knew only that he'd been instrumental in the Manhattan project, that he was more experimenter than theoretician, maybe an engineer, rather than a physicist. But it turns out (assuming the film and the book it's based on are right) that he was very much a theoretical physicist — even theorising about black holes — and very much not an experimentalist.</p><p>Later 'more politician now than scientist', as one of the many other characters says. And those other characters: so many names from the history of physics, many with parts so small you don't even realise they were there till you look at the cast list. Feynman, for example.</p><p>Heisenberg (I didn't know his politics were so uncertain); Bohr. Einstein, obviously, though he wasn't involved in the Manhattan Project.</p><p>Artistic license: how far were they from the trinity bomb, the initial test detonation?

I can be fairly sure of this, as the bookmarks I found in it, when I picked it up back in May, were a pair of old-school paper train tickets from 2004.

				"content_text": "I [mentioned in May](https://devilgate.org/2023/05/29/films-books-blogging.html), that I had been reading this. It's taken me till now to finish it.\n\nIn another sense it's taken me a lot longer: I first started reading it in 2004. Back then I was [doing an Open University literature course](https://devilgate.org/2005/10/20/postexam-comedown.html). In one module an extract from <cite>[Daniel Deronda](https://micro.blog/books/9780140434279)</cite> was one of the options for us to write about. I think I must have chosen it, because my tutor sung its praises, saying it was a great one to read over Christmas, 'curled up next to the fire.'\n\nSo I bought it and started it at the time. I can be fairly sure of this, as the bookmarks I found in it, when I picked it up back in May, were a pair of old-school paper train tickets from 2004. Two markers, of course, because this is a classics edition with comprehensive endnotes. \n\nThe main bookmark was around page 200, so I got a decent way into it. Except this is a book of over 800 pages, so actually not that far. I don't know why I stopped. Probably just got distracted by other books and petered out. I started from the beginning again this time, and found I remembered almost nothing of what I read nearly 20 years ago.\n\nBut enough meta story about my history with the book.

They always included the size, in old-fashioned imperial units: one-inch, two-inch. Probably inch-and-a-half.</p>\n<p>In the early days we wore the big ones. My first one was almost certainly a Beatles one, but I don&rsquo;t remember what design it had. I do recall a glittery Thin Lizzy one, when I went through my period of them being one of my faves. Wings, maybe? Probably.</p>\n<p>Anyway, with punk, the badge size that was considered cool, or even acceptable, reduced. Anything bigger than an inch across would lead to mockery, for sure. Although I think Brendan&rsquo;s Stranglers badge, saying &lsquo;Something Better Change&rsquo; (&lsquo;Because I like the song and I like what it says&rsquo;) was of the two-inch persuasion, but that was in the early days.</p>\n<p>Watty&rsquo;s one, the one that I&rsquo;m talking about: that was probably even earlier. It was white, with the outline of what I had to get quite close to realise was a penny farthing bicycle.

Do you not know about it?&rsquo; Watty wasn&rsquo;t too bad in this way, but the default reaction to someone being ignorant of something you liked was mockery, back then, when we were 13, 14. To be honest, probably for a decade or more after that, too. Instead of the healthier attempt to infect the ignorant one with our own enthusiasm. Or at least inform them about it.</p>\n<p>I learned, though, that it was a weird programme that was on late at night, and anyway it was over now, so even if it hadn&rsquo;t been on at a time that I wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to stay up on a school night, it was finished, so there was no chance I&rsquo;d ever get to see it.</p>\n<p>Pity.</p>\n<p>Of course, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Prisoner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was originally broadcast in 1967-8, so if Watty was watching it ten years later, it does show that repeats were a thing. If only there were a way we could have our own copies of TV programmes. But what a fantastic, farcical idea!</p>\n<p>I know it was the early days, because the name &lsquo;The Prisoner&rsquo; did not immediately make me think of The Clash.

				"content_text": "Watty was  wearing a badge, one of the big, old kind. Probably two inches across, round. They used to advertise them in the back of <cite>Sounds</cite>, <cite>NME</cite>, <cite>Record Mirror</cite> (and I think there was a fourth member of the British weekly music press, but I can't recall it). They always included the size, in old-fashioned imperial units: one-inch, two-inch. Probably inch-and-a-half.\n\nIn the early days we wore the big ones. My first one was almost certainly a Beatles one, but I don't remember what design it had. I do recall a glittery Thin Lizzy one, when I went through my period of them being one of my faves. Wings, maybe? Probably.\n\nAnyway, with punk, the badge size that was considered cool, or even acceptable, reduced. Anything bigger than an inch across would lead to mockery, for sure. Although I think Brendan's Stranglers badge, saying 'Something Better Change' ('Because I like the song and I like what it says') was of the two-inch persuasion, but that was in the early days.\n\nWatty's one, the one that I'm talking about: that was probably even earlier. It was white, with the outline of what I had to get quite close to realise was a penny farthing bicycle. And a number: 6.\n\n'What's that about, then?'\n\n'It's [<cite>The Prisoner</cite>](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/158671)! Do you not know about it?' Watty wasn't too bad in this way, but the default reaction to someone being ignorant of something you liked was mockery, back then, when we were 13, 14. To be honest, probably for a decade or more after that, too. Instead of the healthier attempt to infect the ignorant one with our own enthusiasm. Or at least inform them about it.\n\nI learned, though, that it was a weird programme that was on late at night, and anyway it was over now, so even if it hadn't been on at a time that I wouldn't have been allowed to stay up on a school night, it was finished, so there was no chance I'd ever get to see it.\n\nPity.\n\nOf course, <cite>The Prisoner</cite> was originally broadcast in 1967-8, so if Watty was watching it ten years later, it does show that repeats were a thing. If only there were a way we could have our own copies of TV programmes. But what a fantastic, farcical idea!\n\nI know it was the early days, because the name 'The Prisoner' did not immediately make me think of The Clash. The [B-side](https://song.link/i/688798635) of '[(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais](https://song.link/i/647246391)' shares a title with Patrick McGoohan's paranoid cold-war ex-spy drama. I don't think it has anything else in common with it, but you can't be sure.\n\nI finally saw some episodes in the early nineties. I bought some on VHS, along with my friend Johnny, who also hadn't seen it. But that didn't prove very practical, as we live in different cities. And VHS was expensive. Two episodes per tape for, what fifteen quid? So that petered out.\n\nMuch later I got the DVD box set. And it's been one of the things we've been watching over the last few months. Er, years, maybe. It might have started in lockdown.\n\nTonight we finally watched the last two episodes. Which were much better than I had been led to believe. \n\nIt's kind of amazing, saturated as it is with sixties fears about mind control, brainwashing, hypnotism. Is anything real after the unnamed main character gets gassed in the opening of the first episode (repeated in the opening credits of almost every episode)? Maybe the whole thing is a hallucination induced by the gas, you know? \n\nThere are certainly plenty of actual induced hallucinations or dreamlike states in the series. Which is why you can't trust the increasingly psychedelic ending. \n\nThe whole thing is a mindfuck. I loved it.\n",

I've been busy with other things.\n\n## Other Things\n\n### Writing a Novel\n\nWhat time I had for writing outside of work, I tried to spend mainly on completing my novel. You'll recall that I did a [Creative Writing MA](https://devilgate.org/categories/cwma/) in 2020–21. I graduated in May 2022. My [dissertation](https://devilgate.org/2021/09/17/dissertation-submitted.html) was essentially the first 15,000 words of a novel (along with a preface on how it had all come together). I [promised myself](https://devilgate.org/2022/12/17/at-the-start.html) that I'd finish it by the end of the year. I haven't quite achieved that goal, but I expect to in the next couple of weeks.\n\n### New Job\n\nBut to that 'outside of work', above: I started a new job in February. I never quite got round to writing about it here, except on my [`/now` page](https://devilgate.org/now/), which is an infrequently-maintained page that's meant to say what I'm up to at any time. I was and am glad to have it, of course, but it's amazing how much working 9–5:30 again takes away from your ability to do other things.\n\nThe job itself? I was employed as a Java Developer — that's literally in my job title — and I have written precisely zero lines of Java.\n\nInstead, I found myself plunged into the exciting new world of infrastructure as code, or IaC, and the [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) language. I might write more about that at some point, but in short, it seems I work in [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) now, and I'm enjoying it.\n\n#### Digression: On Writing at Work\n\nI've written over 70,000 words of a novel over the past year-and-a-half or so. But since February I've written something like 100,000 words at work. This comes from keeping copious notes on what I've being doing and what I've learned, and so on. I thank [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for making it easy to do so, and for working in a way that matches how I want to work. But I wonder: why didn't I keep notes like this before? I always wrote things down, of course, but not this systematically, this comprehensively.\n\nIt's a mystery.\n\n### Jury Duty\n\nIn May I spent three weeks on a Jury at [Wood Green Crown Court](https://hornseyhistorical.org.uk/wood-green-crown-court-what-was-there-before/). That was an interesting experience. I might write more about it one day.\n\n### Etc\n\nAnd all the other things that make up life.

I&rsquo;m not sure &lsquo;thriller&rsquo; is quite the right term. It&rsquo;s exciting enough, but there isn&rsquo;t the tension that would take it up to &lsquo;thriller&rsquo; level. Not least because Karen Pirie is never in any danger, other than possibly pissing off her boss, the deputy chief constable of Police Scotland.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never read Val McDermid before, so picking up one of her later ones — possibly her latest: published in 2020, set just before the pandemic, and ending as lockdown starts — would be a strange choice. But sometimes you&rsquo;re in a holiday house and there are some books and it&rsquo;s not so much a choice as an offering. I&rsquo;ve fancied checking out some <em>tartan noir</em> for a while, anyway.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s good. I enjoy a crime novel from time to time, and this one certainly kept the pages turning. Backstory was filled in very efficiently, without it feeling like infodumping.

				"content_text": "'[A Karen Pirie thriller](https://www.valmcdermid.com/still-life/),' the description on the cover says of this. I'm not sure 'thriller' is quite the right term. It's exciting enough, but there isn't the tension that would take it up to 'thriller' level. Not least because Karen Pirie is never in any danger, other than possibly pissing off her boss, the deputy chief constable of Police Scotland.\n\nI've never read Val McDermid before, so picking up one of her later ones — possibly her latest: published in 2020, set just before the pandemic, and ending as lockdown starts — would be a strange choice. But sometimes you're in a holiday house and there are some books and it's not so much a choice as an offering. I've fancied checking out some _tartan noir_ for a while, anyway.\n\nIt's good. I enjoy a crime novel from time to time, and this one certainly kept the pages turning. Backstory was filled in very efficiently, without it feeling like infodumping. And reading about the chill autumn in Scotland (with slight detours into France, the north of England, and Ireland) took the edge off some of the Greek heat.\n\nThe title is a little confusing.

But Robin Sloan, in his newsletter, which isn&rsquo;t really a newsletter, because he just sends a link to a <a href=\"https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lostthread/\">blog post</a> (with a few added words), says this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An industrialist intends to purchase Twitter, Inc. His substantial success launching reusable spaceships does nothing to prepare him for the challenge of building social spaces. The latter calls on every liberal art at once, while the former is just rocket science.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wanted to quote that because I loved &lsquo;just rocket science.&rsquo; The common expression, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not rocket science&rsquo; has always mildly amused me, as a physics graduate. Because rocket science is <em>relatively</em> both simple and easy. It&rsquo;s straightforward Newtonian physics. Mass. Acceleration. Forces. The physics is simple, the sums are easy.</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go anywhere near even Special Relativity (still straightforward, if harder), General Relativity (much more complex), or of course anywhere close to quantum physics (frankly the most complex and confusing thing of all).</p>\n<p>All of which is just to say that physics has more and less difficult areas. Rocket <em>engineering</em>, of course, is quite another matter. There you&rsquo;ve got all sort of complex materials science, chemistry, end even — if crew are involved — biology, sociology, psychology. Those are <em>much</em> harder.</p>\n<p>As far as common similes for the ease of something go, I&rsquo;ve always preferred &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not brain surgery.&rsquo;  If I think about it I&rsquo;m amazed that operating successfully on a living human brain is even possible, and I bow my head to those who can do it. While hoping they&rsquo;ll never have to go near said bowed object, of course.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that would have been that for this post, except that I pasted the above quote from Sloan into a text editor. But it didn&rsquo;t look like it does above. It looked like this:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>An indus-tri-al-ist intends to pur-chase Twit-ter, Inc. His sub-stan-tial suc-cess launch-ing reusable space-ships does noth-ing to pre-pare him for the chal-lenge of build-ing social spaces. The lat-ter calls on every lib-eral art at once, while the for-mer is just rocket science.\n</code></pre><p>Where did all those hyphens come from? They look like they&rsquo;re non-printing characters. Ones that won&rsquo;t show up when a web page is rendered, but are there in the source code. Why? I can only imagine two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a deliberate ploy to make it harder to copy quotes, as I have done above. But Sloan is a pro-web kinda guy, as far as I can tell. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like something he&rsquo;d do.</li>\n<li>A glitch. An artifact of the software he used to create the post. It&rsquo;s most likely that.

				"content_text": "\nI wasn't going to write anything about Elon Musk buying Twitter, because I mostly don't care. But Robin Sloan, in his newsletter, which isn't really a newsletter, because he just sends a link to a [blog post](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lostthread/) (with a few added words), says this:\n\n>An industrialist intends to purchase Twitter, Inc. His substantial success launching reusable spaceships does nothing to prepare him for the challenge of building social spaces. The latter calls on every liberal art at once, while the former is just rocket science.\n\nI wanted to quote that because I loved 'just rocket science.' The common expression, 'It's not rocket science' has always mildly amused me, as a physics graduate. Because rocket science is _relatively_ both simple and easy. It's straightforward Newtonian physics. Mass. Acceleration. Forces. The physics is simple, the sums are easy. \n\nYou don't have to go anywhere near even Special Relativity (still straightforward, if harder), General Relativity (much more complex), or of course anywhere close to quantum physics (frankly the most complex and confusing thing of all).\n\nAll of which is just to say that physics has more and less difficult areas. Rocket _engineering_, of course, is quite another matter. There you've got all sort of complex materials science, chemistry, end even — if crew are involved — biology, sociology, psychology. Those are _much_ harder.\n\nAs far as common similes for the ease of something go, I've always preferred 'It's not brain surgery.'  If I think about it I'm amazed that operating successfully on a living human brain is even possible, and I bow my head to those who can do it. While hoping they'll never have to go near said bowed object, of course.\n\nAnyway, that would have been that for this post, except that I pasted the above quote from Sloan into a text editor. But it didn't look like it does above. It looked like this:\n\n```\nAn indus-tri-al-ist intends to pur-chase Twit-ter, Inc. His sub-stan-tial suc-cess launch-ing reusable space-ships does noth-ing to pre-pare him for the chal-lenge of build-ing social spaces. The lat-ter calls on every lib-eral art at once, while the for-mer is just rocket science.\n```\n\nWhere did all those hyphens come from? They look like they're non-printing characters. Ones that won't show up when a web page is rendered, but are there in the source code. Why? I can only imagine two reasons:\n\n1. a deliberate ploy to make it harder to copy quotes, as I have done above. But Sloan is a pro-web kinda guy, as far as I can tell. It doesn't seem like something he'd do.\n2. A glitch. An artifact of the software he used to create the post. It's most likely that. Weird one, though.\n\nStranger still is that the character is not even a hyphen. As I discovered when I search-and-replaced it in BBEdit, it actually appears to be this: `\\x{AD}`.\n\nI don't even know what that is. Some kind of hexadecimal representation of something. An invisible hyphen, presumably. Which I had to search-and-replace with actual hyphens to make them visible above. Looking at the source code, it's written as the HTML entity `&shy;`, which the DuckDuck tells me is a 'soft hyphen'.\n\nAll very odd.\n\nI have positive feelings about Sloan, except for his closing image. I'll risk another paste:\n\n> - Wishful descriptions of Twitter as \t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1507777261654605828\">“the de facto public town square”</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1518772753460998145\">“the closest thing we have to a global consciousness”</a> sound, to me, like Peter Pan begging the audience to clap and raise a swooning&nbsp;Tinkerbell.\n>\n> - You don’t have to&nbsp;clap.</p>\n\nYeah, but… of _course_ you have to clap. Without wanting to get all metaphysical on you, if you don't clap when Tinkerbell is dying, you've got no soul.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a strange set of opinions popping up on Twitter over the last week or so, essentially blaming the US, the UK, and/or NATO for Putin&rsquo;s illegal and horrifying war on Ukraine. Which on the face of it is bizarre, at best.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible that NATO&rsquo;s expansion over the last couple of decades was unwise. Yet who could blame small countries close to Russia from seeking the protection that membership brings? Putin&rsquo;s belligerence was well known even before the current attack.</p>\n<p>George Monbiot makes the point well in his excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> piece:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a strong argument that Nato should have been <a href=\"https://socialeurope.eu/what-is-nato-for\">disbanded</a> at the end of the cold war. But while Putin’s sense of threat seems to have been heightened by Nato expansion and mission creep, Nato expansion has also been driven in part by Putin’s belligerence. Are we really to believe that Estonia and Latvia joined because they wanted to attack Russia? On the contrary, it’s because they fear attack. While Nato’s growth is likely to have contributed to the crisis, it’s ridiculous to suggest that Russia is not the aggressor.</p>\n<p>&ndash; George Monbiot, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin\">We must confront Russian propaganda – even when it comes from those we respect</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He suggests that Russian propaganda is at least partly to blame. It seems have made inroads on the left. Monbiot mentions the Stop the War Coalition, which normally we would think is an admirable goal and organisation. But their recent <a href=\"https://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/list-of-signatories-stop-the-war-statement-on-the-crisis-over-ukraine/\">letter</a> claims the British government &lsquo;have poured oil on the fire throughout this episode.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m no supporter of Johnson or the Tories, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair. They also say that they &lsquo;do not endorse the nature or conduct of either the Russian or Ukrainian regimes.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the Ukrainians have done except prepare to defend themselves, and then do so.

				"content_text": "I've seen a strange set of opinions popping up on Twitter over the last week or so, essentially blaming the US, the UK, and/or NATO for Putin's illegal and horrifying war on Ukraine. Which on the face of it is bizarre, at best.\n\nIt's possible that NATO's expansion over the last couple of decades was unwise. Yet who could blame small countries close to Russia from seeking the protection that membership brings? Putin's belligerence was well known even before the current attack.\n\nGeorge Monbiot makes the point well in his excellent <cite>Guardian</cite> piece:\n\n> There is a strong argument that Nato should have been [disbanded](https://socialeurope.eu/what-is-nato-for) at the end of the cold war. But while Putin’s sense of threat seems to have been heightened by Nato expansion and mission creep, Nato expansion has also been driven in part by Putin’s belligerence. Are we really to believe that Estonia and Latvia joined because they wanted to attack Russia? On the contrary, it’s because they fear attack. While Nato’s growth is likely to have contributed to the crisis, it’s ridiculous to suggest that Russia is not the aggressor.\n>\n> -- George Monbiot, [We must confront Russian propaganda – even when it comes from those we respect](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin)\n\nHe suggests that Russian propaganda is at least partly to blame. It seems have made inroads on the left. Monbiot mentions the Stop the War Coalition, which normally we would think is an admirable goal and organisation. But their recent [letter](https://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/list-of-signatories-stop-the-war-statement-on-the-crisis-over-ukraine/) claims the British government 'have poured oil on the fire throughout this episode.' I'm no supporter of Johnson or the Tories, but I don't think that's fair. They also say that they 'do not endorse the nature or conduct of either the Russian or Ukrainian regimes.' \n\nI don't know what the Ukrainians have done except prepare to defend themselves, and then do so. I'm as against war as any former CND member from the eighties, but when a country is invaded, it has a right to fight back.\n\nMonbiot says it well:\n\n> True anti-imperialism means opposing not only the west’s imperialism, essential as this is. It’s about opposing all imperialism, whether western, Russian, Chinese or other.\n>\n> -- George Monbiot, [As before](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin)\n\nAs always, of course, it is the ordinary people who suffer.

As they did with the formerly-free review site [The Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/) when they bought it, for example. Which would be a shame.\n\nSomething I meant to write about before, but never got round to, was how all the mainstream press wrote about it. They made it hard to find, and, I think, helped to encourage the scammy app store rip-off versions.

A few paragraphs in I realised that I wanted to read the book, and the article was heading deep into spoiler territory. So I stopped reading it and downloaded the book. Read it as soon as I finished [the last one](/blog/2021/11/26/the-caledonian-gambit-by-dan-moren-books-2021-23/).\n\nIt's the story of four neglected sisters, whose parents run a boys' boarding school and have no time for anything else, including their daughters; and of a ghost that is haunting them, and who might be one of them. And of an ancient darkness that the sisters accidentally invoked.\n\nBut the real darkness is the neglect.\n\nHighly recommended, and the article I linked above is very good and insightful (but deeply spoilerific) too.\n\n[^Jones]: Jones is not plural, so it should be Jones's.\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Talk about not remembering books: I&rsquo;ve got to ask myself whether I ever <em>did</em> read this one. I remembered one thing from it, but it&rsquo;s not how I remembered it. When people jack in to the matrix they use headsets &ndash; &lsquo;trodes&rsquo; &ndash;  with electrodes that connect to their temples.</p>\n<p>There is a transition between the real world and cyberspace when they connect, and I had this memory of one cowboy (people who enter the matrix or cyberspace are called &lsquo;cowboys&rsquo; or &lsquo;jockeys&rsquo;) who had a set of trodes that made the transition feel like the world was falling apart. I&rsquo;ve been half waiting for that bit through these three books. Here&rsquo;s a quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Ready?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, and Tick&rsquo;s room was gone, its walls a flutter of cards, tumbling and receding, against the bright grid, the towering forms of data.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Nice transition, that,&rsquo; she heard him say. &lsquo;Built into the trodes, that is. But of drama…&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So that must be the bit I remembered, but if you had asked me I&rsquo;d have said I thought it came <a href=\"/blog/2021/10/30/count-zero-by-william-gibson-books-2021-21/\">a book</a> or <a href=\"/blog/2021/10/13/neuromancer-by-william-gibson-books-2021-20/\">two</a> earlier, and was mentioned more than once.</p>\n<p>But what of the book itself? It keeps up the standard, maybe raises it slightly. We have four interconnected stories, four viewpoint characters, told in alternating chapters. One of the stories &ndash; that of Kumiko, who is experiencing the flutter of cards, above &ndash; isn&rsquo;t really relevant, in the sense that it doesn&rsquo;t drive the plot at all. Things that happen around her do affect the main plot, but she&rsquo;s not really aware of them.</p>\n<p>What surprised me about this and the three books overall, is how much they really are a trilogy. I had the impression that they were considered only to be very loosely connected at best; essentially three stories set in the same <em>milieu</em>.

When people jack in to the matrix they use headsets -- 'trodes' --  with electrodes that connect to their temples. \n\nThere is a transition between the real world and cyberspace when they connect, and I had this memory of one cowboy (people who enter the matrix or cyberspace are called 'cowboys' or 'jockeys') who had a set of trodes that made the transition feel like the world was falling apart. I've been half waiting for that bit through these three books. Here's a quote:\n\n> 'Ready?'\n>\n> 'Yes,' she said, and Tick's room was gone, its walls a flutter of cards, tumbling and receding, against the bright grid, the towering forms of data.\n> \n> 'Nice transition, that,' she heard him say. 'Built into the trodes, that is. But of drama…'\n\nSo that must be the bit I remembered, but if you had asked me I'd have said I thought it came [a book](/blog/2021/10/30/count-zero-by-william-gibson-books-2021-21/) or [two](/blog/2021/10/13/neuromancer-by-william-gibson-books-2021-20/) earlier, and was mentioned more than once.\n\nBut what of the book itself? It keeps up the standard, maybe raises it slightly. We have four interconnected stories, four viewpoint characters, told in alternating chapters. One of the stories -- that of Kumiko, who is experiencing the flutter of cards, above -- isn't really relevant, in the sense that it doesn't drive the plot at all. Things that happen around her do affect the main plot, but she's not really aware of them.\n\nWhat surprised me about this and the three books overall, is how much they really are a trilogy. I had the impression that they were considered only to be very loosely connected at best; essentially three stories set in the same _milieu_. But in fact not only do characters recur, everything here ties back to the events of <cite>Neuromancer</cite>, which happened some fourteen years before.\n\nAll very worth reading if you haven't already.\n",

It reminded me of <em>Shallow Grave</em>, at least at the start, in this way: if you find a load of money that's obviously come from a drug deal gone wrong, or otherwise somehow involved in organised crime, there is one thing you should <em>not</em> do. That is try it keep it all, to run away with it or hide it, and expect to survive the wrath of the criminals.</p><p>The safest thing, of course, is to just walk away from it all and call the cops. But if you must get into it, then obviously what you should do is take <em>some</em> of the money. Not a lot. Say, 10%. An amount that the gangsters might plausibly accept as having gone missing during the the shootout, or whatever. Leave the rest, call the cops, and let them handle the aftermath. You might get away with it.</p><p>Here, the main character does exactly the wrong thing. What's worse, in story terms, is that from the start we have no one to identify with: no character who is obviously the 'hero,' if you like. No one to root for. Because it all starts off without us having any particular reason to root for Llewelyn. And as it goes on, and we do start to want him to make it — if only because the focus is mainly on him — he continues to annoyingly make terrible choices.</p><p>Worse still -- and spoilers ahead -- worse still, his story is just dropped on the floor. He doesn't even get the respect of us seeing his end. The narrative hands over to a secondary character (though to be fair, that character, the sheriff, is the first character we meet, if only in voiceover).</p><p>And the end is just... nothing. </p><p>It is by far my least favourite Coen brothers film.</p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/devilgate/film/no-country-for-old-men/\">See in Letterboxd</a></p>\n",

In fact, at least from this I&rsquo;d go further: he <em>believed in the existence</em> of such a dimension. He, I learned, was the originator of the term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract\">tesseract</a>, which &ndash; as I&rsquo;m sure you know &ndash; is the four-dimensional equivalent of a cube.</p>\n<p>So much for that. What of the story? It&rsquo;s interesting, a little odd, and slightly experimental, in terms of its telling. It makes use of letters, diagrams, and other documents from Hinton&rsquo;s life.

				"content_text": "\n\nThe author is one of my [MA](link://category/cwma) supervisors, so take that under advisement, I guess.\n\nThis is a historical novel, based on the real life of Charles Howard Hinton, a Victorian mathematician who studied the idea of a fourth spatial dimension. In fact, at least from this I'd go further: he _believed in the existence_ of such a dimension. He, I learned, was the originator of the term [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract), which -- as I'm sure you know -- is the four-dimensional equivalent of a cube.\n\nSo much for that. What of the story? It's interesting, a little odd, and slightly experimental, in terms of its telling. It makes use of letters, diagrams, and other documents from Hinton's life. But a lot of the really interesting bits of Hinton's life -- his bigamous marriage and being convicted for the same, and subsequent departure for, and time in, Japan, for example -- are told largely offscreen. Or second-hand and partially, via some of those letters.\n\nWhich is all fair enough, but I feel that we didn't really get to know Hinton as a person. I could have done with more of that. In fact we get to know some other members of his family slightly better, as the story's focus changes in the second half.\n\nThe book is split into sections called 'Point,' 'Line,' 'Square,' 'Cube,' 'Tesseract,' 'Cube,' 'Square,' 'Line,' 'Point.' Numbered chapters or subsections, 1 to 14, are included across the first 'Line' and 'Square.' But chapter 9 is missing, or skipped. I kept trying to find some mathematical reason for this -- 9 is a square number, of course, but it's not the only square number in the list, and there's nothing special about 9 in the text, that I noticed.

I’m not going to, though, because I’m not sure what it was trying to achieve. What I try to do with star ratings is judge how well, in my opinion, the film achieves what it was trying to do. I don’t claim I always manage that, but when it’s not clear what the film’s purpose was, it becomes next to impossible.</p>\n<p>Or: you can’t reduce something as long and complex, audacious and challenging as this, to a mere zero-to-ten scale.\n\n<sup id=\"fnref:boxstars\">\n\t<a href=\"#fn:boxstars\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a>\n</sup>\n\n\n</p>\n<p>Across six films, totalling around seven hours, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adam Curtis</a> gives us ‘An Emotional History of the Modern World,’ as the subtitle calls it. As I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2021/05/26/the-illuminatus-trilogy-by-robert-shea-and-robert-anton-wilson-books-2021-8/\" rel=\"nofollow\">last post</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Wendell_Thornley\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kerry Thornley</a> of Discordian fame is interviewed early in it. That is, an interview with him is used. He’s dead, so it’s not like he was interviewed for these films. Indeed, as far as I can tell, nothing was shot for these films: the visuals are entirely comprised of library footage.</p>\n<p>Curtis narrates over them — sometimes with quite a disconnected effect, where the images have no obvious connection to the story he’s telling. Similarly, the use of music can be quite jarring. Sometimes it’s completely relevant to the matter at hand, but often there’s no obvious connection. And the titular Kylie song is not used at all.</p>\n<p>It’s not even that obvious why the series is called that, come to think of it. And some of the individual episode titles are even more opaque, notably the last one: ‘Are We Pigeon or are We Dancer?’ I feel sure it’s a quote, and I think it’s probably from a song, but I was alert to it turning up, and as far as I could tell, it didn’t.</p>\n<p>OK, a quick <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%27Are+We+Pigeon+or+are+We+Dancer%3F%27\" rel=\"nofollow\"> DuckDuck </a> gives mainly hits about the episode, but also some about <a href=\"https://www.gigwise.com/news/47201/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a track by The Killers</a> called ‘Human,’ which includes the line ‘are we human or are we dancer?’ So it’s probably alluding to that. Oddly that line is inspired by a Hunter S Thompson quote that I’m not familiar with, ‘We’re raising a generation of dancers.’ Which sounds pretty good to me, even if Hunter meant it critically.</p>\n<p>Anyway, what’s this absurdly long film <em>about</em>?</p>\n<p>It’s a bleak, depressing, but nonetheless compelling vision of human history, covering conspiracies and conspiracy theories, wars, revolution, surveillance capitalism, and capitalism more broadly, the tension between the collective and the individual, and a whole hell of a lot more.</p>\n<p>But Curtis never gives a thesis statement. He never tells us, in the news journalist’s way, what he’s going to tell us. Or more to the point, what conclusions he’s going to draw from what he’s going to tell us. And his style is very disjointed: he dots about in time and space, with little more to connect the dots than a ‘but’: ‘But in China…’</p>\n<p>In that particular tic, it’s not at all unlike the postmodern games of <cite>Illuminatus!</cite>.</p>\n<p>He does come to kind of a conclusion at the end of the two-hour-long sixth episode, but it’s not a very satisfying or convincing one. Which is fair enough, I suppose. One of the recurring thoughts is the idea that society today is too complex for anyone to understand it fully. The problem with that, that he draws our attention to, is that that understanding has caused many politicians to give up trying to change things for the better, which tends to result in burgeoning corruption.</p>\n<p>He does end with a note of possible hope, but I think I might have to watch parts of it again to get all of the nuances.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/devilgate/film/cant-get-you-out-of-my-head/\">See in Letterboxd</a></p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:boxstars\" role=\"doc-endnote\"><p>Letterboxd supports half stars, so five stars is ten points.<a href=\"#fnref:boxstars\" class=\"footnote-back\" role=\"doc-backlink\">↩︎</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

Those can be interesting or amusing, and sure, it's realistic that they'd have to have more than just a forty-year-old cold case to work on, over a year. But in the end they feel like padding.\n- As the denouement unfolds she uses a gimmick where the characters learn or work out something, which they relate to each other, but which is not revealed to us. It's kind of annoying, because it's suddenly hiding info from the reader that the characters have, where earlier in the story that wasn't happening. I think she's done it before in some (maybe all) of the Strike novels.\n\nBut a lot of fun, anyway.\n",

Apart from collecting an order, all I could do was look in the window.\n\nSo it was fantastic to be able to go into the shop and _browse_. I'd almost forgotten what that's like.\n\n[^gornick]: <cite>The Situation and the Story</cite>, by Vivian Gornick. I don't know why it had to cross the ocean.\n\n",

Especially given the [panic over a statistically meaningless set of blood clots](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/eu-medicines-regulator-to-report-on-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-safety), and the news today that [the UK's supply is going to be temporarily constrained](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/17/nhs-covid-vaccine-rollout-under-50s-delayed-major-shortage).\n\nBut considering that it's only just over year since we learned about this virus and the terrible disease it brings, it's worth taking a moment to celebrate the scientists and doctors who were able to develop the vaccines so quickly. Not to mention all the NHS staff who are getting it to people.\n",

Those five weeks went fast, but 2020 is The Year When Time Was Weird, for everyone. How is it going, you ask.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Pretty well, thanks. At first glance, with only two actual sessions, the workload looked light. But as is common with postgraduate courses, you have a lot of work to do on your own. Add to that, it&rsquo;s a <em>writing</em> course: we have to write, and you can&rsquo;t do that while sitting in a class.</p>\n<p>Or you could, for small exercises, and I think maybe they would be asking us to do that kind of thing if this were a conventional year and we were sitting in a seminar room in Bloomsbury. It is, however, the most unconventional of years, and we are sitting in our own homes on Microsoft Teams.</p>\n<p>There are two modules. Everyone does the Writing and Reading Seminar, where we focus on short stories. Each week we read and discuss two or three assigned stories, with there being a theme or area of focus: Character, Voice, Territory, for example. Then we workshop pieces submitted by three members of the class. Everyone gets to submit a piece of up to 4000 words, twice this term.</p>\n<p>For my first piece I decided to get out of my comfort zone (such as it is) and write a purely realist piece. No spaceships, no magic; no element of the fantastic whatsoever. I think it worked out pretty well.</p>\n<p>Those pieces are not assessed, but in January we have to submit a 4000-word piece that will be. I only recently learned that this piece has to be a reworking of one of the two pieces we&rsquo;ll have workshopped in class. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have done anything differently, but I would have liked to have known that sooner.</p>\n<p>The second module I&rsquo;m doing is called Contemporary Writing 2: Genre<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, or just &lsquo;Genre.&rsquo;  We spend two weeks on each of these genres: crime, science fiction, historical fiction, and young adult fiction.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> There&rsquo;s a novel assigned for each one. The first week has a two short, prerecorded lectures, and in the seminar we discuss those, and techniques, and the assigned novel.</p>\n<p>For the second week we each write a 1000-word piece in the genre in question, and some of us have the pieces workshopped. We got to choose the genres in which we wanted to be workshopped. I chose SF and crime. Even those of us who aren&rsquo;t being workshopped in a given week have our pieces discussed on the class forum.</p>\n<p>So as you can see, there&rsquo;s quite a lot of reading, analysis, and commenting, as well as actual writing.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying it a lot, but if you were to ask me what I&rsquo;ve learned, I&rsquo;m not sure I could specify that yet. However, the practice, the fact of looking at my own writing and that of others, professionally-published and not, in great detail: that alone is bound to improve my writing, I feel.</p>\n<p>Right now it&rsquo;s reading week. I don&rsquo;t recall having such a thing back when I was an undergraduate, but maybe we did. They&rsquo;re standard now, just like half-term breaks at school.<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> So we have no classes, and some extra short stories to read, and time to catch up on the novels. I finished <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wolf Hall<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday, so I only have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Hate U Give<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to read for YA. Plenty of time to get some writing done.</p>\n<p>Oh, and a couple of homework assignments, too.

				"content_text": "\n\n\nWe're halfway through the first term of my [Creative Writing masters](/categories/cwma/) course. Those five weeks went fast, but 2020 is The Year When Time Was Weird, for everyone. How is it going, you ask.[^punctuate]\n\nPretty well, thanks. At first glance, with only two actual sessions, the workload looked light. But as is common with postgraduate courses, you have a lot of work to do on your own. Add to that, it's a _writing_ course: we have to write, and you can't do that while sitting in a class. \n\nOr you could, for small exercises, and I think maybe they would be asking us to do that kind of thing if this were a conventional year and we were sitting in a seminar room in Bloomsbury. It is, however, the most unconventional of years, and we are sitting in our own homes on Microsoft Teams.\n\nThere are two modules. Everyone does the Writing and Reading Seminar, where we focus on short stories. Each week we read and discuss two or three assigned stories, with there being a theme or area of focus: Character, Voice, Territory, for example. Then we workshop pieces submitted by three members of the class. Everyone gets to submit a piece of up to 4000 words, twice this term.\n\nFor my first piece I decided to get out of my comfort zone (such as it is) and write a purely realist piece. No spaceships, no magic; no element of the fantastic whatsoever. I think it worked out pretty well.\n\nThose pieces are not assessed, but in January we have to submit a 4000-word piece that will be. I only recently learned that this piece has to be a reworking of one of the two pieces we'll have workshopped in class. I don't think I'd have done anything differently, but I would have liked to have known that sooner.\n\nThe second module I'm doing is called Contemporary Writing 2: Genre[^what1], or just 'Genre.'  We spend two weeks on each of these genres: crime, science fiction, historical fiction, and young adult fiction.[^notagenre] There's a novel assigned for each one. The first week has a two short, prerecorded lectures, and in the seminar we discuss those, and techniques, and the assigned novel.\n\nFor the second week we each write a 1000-word piece in the genre in question, and some of us have the pieces workshopped. We got to choose the genres in which we wanted to be workshopped. I chose SF and crime. Even those of us who aren't being workshopped in a given week have our pieces discussed on the class forum.\n\nSo as you can see, there's quite a lot of reading, analysis, and commenting, as well as actual writing.\n\nI'm enjoying it a lot, but if you were to ask me what I've learned, I'm not sure I could specify that yet. However, the practice, the fact of looking at my own writing and that of others, professionally-published and not, in great detail: that alone is bound to improve my writing, I feel.\n\nRight now it's reading week. I don't recall having such a thing back when I was an undergraduate, but maybe we did. They're standard now, just like half-term breaks at school.[^october] So we have no classes, and some extra short stories to read, and time to catch up on the novels. I finished <cite>Wolf Hall</cite> yesterday, so I only have <cite>The Hate U Give</cite> to read for YA. Plenty of time to get some writing done.\n\nOh, and a couple of homework assignments, too. All work is homework, of course.\n\n[^punctuate]: I'm always confused about how you should punctuate that idiom. I'm asking a question: it needs a question mark. But neither of these look right:\n\n\t* How is it going? you ask.\n\t* How is it going, you ask?\n\t\n\tIt should really be:\n\t\n\t* 'How is it going?' you ask.\n\t\n\tBut that makes it too much like I'm writing dialogue in a a second-person narrative, and it doesn't really fit with the overall feel of a blog post.\n\n\tThe way I've written it above has no question mark at all, and that can't be right.\n\n[^what1]: I've yet to learn what 'Contemporary Writing 1' is, or was, or if there ever was one.\n\n[^notagenre]: I'd argue that YA is a target market, not a genre, but never mind.\n\n[^october]: It was during my primary school years that Scotland introduced the week-long half-term break in October. 'The October Week,' as it was called, and it was definitely a new thing at the time. I was aware of it particularly because my Mum was a primary school teacher. I can't find any evidence of it now, because there are so many other pages about half-term holiday dates and history projects for October half term. But if my memory is not totally faulty, that's the truth of it.\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Announcing a big life change: I&rsquo;m going to be starting a masters course in a couple of weeks. An <a href=\"http://www.bbk.ac.uk/study/2020/postgraduate/programmes/TMACWRIT_C\">MA in Creative Writing, at Birkbeck, University of London</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"nine-months-in-slippers\">Nine Months in Slippers</h1>\n<p>&ldquo;How did you get here, Martin?&rdquo; I hear you ask. Let me take you back to November last year. I lost my job. The reasons are obscure and not that interesting, but I had been working at <a href=\"https://www.spika.com\">SPIKA</a> for only six months, and suddenly I was out on the street.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>If that had happened a couple of months sooner, I might have been studying all this time. I had been vaguely musing on the idea of doing a masters in journalism. I love to write, and I sometimes think that I kind of missed a calling.</p>\n<p>I was too late for 2019, all the university terms having already started. So I did a bit of job hunting, but mainly took a break till after Christmas.</p>\n<p>When this year that we had no idea was going to be so terrible started, I started looking for jobs, but I also kept thinking about journalism. I started a distance-learning course. Learned a bit of shorthand, and read up on some of the other aspects of the craft. A journalism MA, starting this year, was still on the table.</p>\n<p>Then Coronavirus arrived.</p>\n<p>To be honest, the lockdown didn&rsquo;t change things that much for me: I was at home all the time anyway. But the jobs market, as well as the rest of the world, was affected. It&rsquo;s easy to work from home in software development, but recruitment was down. I had a few interviews, but no success.</p>\n<p>Then somewhere in there I decided that journalism wasn&rsquo;t for me after all. There are aspects of the profession that didn&rsquo;t appeal to me: newsgathering and all that side of it, essentially. I&rsquo;d like to be a columnist or maybe a feature writer, but not so much a reporter. Perhaps more importantly, it&rsquo;s a terrible time for journalism, with newsrooms laying people off and cutting back.</p>\n<p>I kept looking for jobs back in software development. But after a bit, Frances said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do a masters in your own field?&rdquo; It was a good idea: it would be intellectually stimulating, and possibly improve my employability.

				"content_text": "\n\n\n\nAnnouncing a big life change: I'm going to be starting a masters course in a couple of weeks. An [MA in Creative Writing, at Birkbeck, University of London](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/study/2020/postgraduate/programmes/TMACWRIT_C).\n\n# Nine Months in Slippers\n\n\"How did you get here, Martin?\" I hear you ask. Let me take you back to November last year. I lost my job. The reasons are obscure and not that interesting, but I had been working at [SPIKA](https://www.spika.com) for only six months, and suddenly I was out on the street.[^fn1]\n\nIf that had happened a couple of months sooner, I might have been studying all this time. I had been vaguely musing on the idea of doing a masters in journalism. I love to write, and I sometimes think that I kind of missed a calling.\n\nI was too late for 2019, all the university terms having already started. So I did a bit of job hunting, but mainly took a break till after Christmas.\n\nWhen this year that we had no idea was going to be so terrible started, I started looking for jobs, but I also kept thinking about journalism. I started a distance-learning course. Learned a bit of shorthand, and read up on some of the other aspects of the craft. A journalism MA, starting this year, was still on the table.\n\nThen Coronavirus arrived.\n\nTo be honest, the lockdown didn't change things that much for me: I was at home all the time anyway. But the jobs market, as well as the rest of the world, was affected. It's easy to work from home in software development, but recruitment was down. I had a few interviews, but no success.\n\nThen somewhere in there I decided that journalism wasn't for me after all. There are aspects of the profession that didn't appeal to me: newsgathering and all that side of it, essentially. I'd like to be a columnist or maybe a feature writer, but not so much a reporter. Perhaps more importantly, it's a terrible time for journalism, with newsrooms laying people off and cutting back.\n\nI kept looking for jobs back in software development. But after a bit, Frances said, \"Why don't you do a masters in your own field?\" It was a good idea: it would be intellectually stimulating, and possibly improve my employability. I started looking at courses.\n\nComputer science itself (I've never formally studied it), or one of the various data science options? Both had their merits. Either would have been interesting and mentally challenging.\n\n But they didn't [spark joy](https://www.dictionary.com/e/what-does-marie-kondo-mean-when-she-says-spark-joy/), to use a tidiness-related term that [seems appropriate](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/does-it-spark-joy-is-the-wrong-decluttering-question/). I looked at the course outlines, and they were interesting enough, but I could tell I wouldn't have _loved_ doing them. \n\nThere were other subjects, though, and one kept prodding my mind; one that _did_ offer the prospect of joy, the possibility that I would love it.\n\nLike I said, I love to write. \n\n# Choosing\n\nQuite a few institutions offer creative writing MAs, in various forms. I applied to all of them. All the ones in London, anyway, and a few others that offer distance learning. Each needed a personal statement and a sample of writing. Every single one had unique requirements of the sample, in terms of word length and type of piece. Royal Holloway, for example (who rejected me), wanted a short story extract and, uniquely, a piece of critical writing. Most just wanted the fiction.\n\nThere were differences in the course titles, too. London Met's was '[Creative, Digital, and Professional Writing](https://www.londonmet.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/creative-digital-and-professional-writing---ma/).' Westminster's was '[Creative Writing: Writing the City](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/english-and-creative-writing-courses/2020-21/january/full-time/creative-writing-writing-the-city-ma),' though they had closed entry for this year.\n\nCity, University of London has several. But the plain '[Creative Writing](https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/creative-writing)' was showing a message to the effect of 'Applications suspended.' I emailed to ask if this meant that they were full for the year, and was told that no, they had suspended entry for 2020 because there wasn't enough interest. So I applied for another one they have, '[Creative Writing and Publishing](https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/creative-writing-and-publishing).' They got back to me after a few days and said the course was full. Seems to be a slight disconnect there, maybe?\n\nI got offers from London Met, [Kingston](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/creative-writing-distance-learning-ma/) (by distance learning), and Birkbeck.

That may have been signalled by the recent decision to cut 180 jobs (or 12% of its UK workforce) as a result of Covid.\n<br />\n...\n<br />\nBut, tellingly, newsstand print sales, at £49.3m, were 50% down compared with 2016. Last year, print accounted for 42% of revenue (£94 million) and an estimated £75 million of production, distribution and marketing costs. So, the printed newspaper may last year have delivered almost £20m of real profit. But now Covid is pushing it into losses from which it may not be able to recover – without dramatic change.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\nInteresting and unsurprising to learn that Saturday is (was?) its biggest day for print sales:\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"The Guardian to end print? - Flashes & Flames\" data-author=\"\" cite=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/?utm_source=Daily+Lab+email+list&utm_campaign=03c6c90989-dailylabemail3&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d68264fd5e-03c6c90989-396542471\">\nLike most UK national newspapers, The Guardian has been highly profitable on Saturdays because of higher prices and sales volumes. Pre-Covid, The Guardian had been selling 100,000 copies at £2.20 on weeekdays. But, on a Saturday, it was selling 246,000 copies at £3.20 – and with more advertising revenue too.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/?utm_source=Daily+Lab+email+list&utm_campaign=03c6c90989-dailylabemail3&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d68264fd5e-03c6c90989-396542471\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/?utm_source=Daily+Lab+email+list&utm_campaign=03c6c90989-dailylabemail3&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d68264fd5e-03c6c90989-396542471</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter [our local newsagent stopped delivering](/blog/2019/09/11/the-end-of-newspaper-delivery/) the Saturday <cite>Guardian</cite>, we went out and bought it most weeks... until Covid and the lockdown.

Much of the experience (especially of the Newhouse family’s Advance newspaper group in the US) seems to show that reducing the daily frequency seldom works: once the daily habit is broken, newspaper buyers quickly seem to stop buying the paper altogether. A consolation print option could be the expansion of the 101-year-old news magazine Guardian Weekly which claims readers in more than 170 countries.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\nI'd guess they'll maybe keep <cite>The Observer</cite> going for a while: Sunday papers have their own distinct identities.\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"The Guardian to end print? - Flashes & Flames\" data-author=\"\" cite=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">\nThe contrast with digital could not be greater. The Guardian has 160 million monthly uniques across the world, some 25% in the UK. More striking, though, are those digital editions in North America and Australia/New Zealand which, respectively, have advertising revenue of £25 million and £11 million. These are now strong operations, evidenced by Australia where The Guardian is the fourth largest online news service with an audience of 11.6 million (more than 50% of the adult population) – ahead of News Corp’s national daily, The Australian.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\nGood to know it's beating Murdoch on his home turf.\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"The Guardian to end print? - Flashes & Flames\" data-author=\"\" cite=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">\nHarvard’s Nieman Journalism Lab describes The Guardian as “a weird newspaper” because: it has nearly two-thirds of its readers coming from outside its own country; started in one city and moved to another; and is owned by a trust that mandates it promotes liberal journalism in Britain and elsewhere.\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/\">https://flashesandflames.com/2020/07/31/the-guardian-to-end-print/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n\"A weird newspaper\": works for me.\n\n\n\n",

This is harder than it should be because the culture of people having their own domain never really caught on.

And when they are, then you can change the underlying email provider without anyone other than yourself having to know or care. To take a not-made-up example, <code>martin@devilgate.org</code> used to go by a complex combination of Gmail (for the spam filtering and search) and <code>5quidhost.co.uk</code> and its eventual purchaser, TSOHost, because that’s what I used for web hosting, as much as anything else.

While <code>josmith@hey.com</code> might be available right now, if they have any success we’ll soon be back to appending birth years or random numbers to the end of common names, just like on Gmail, Hotmail, etc. Though they have said they intend to support custom domains, so there’s scope for a better solution there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-alternatives\">The Alternatives</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://canion.me\">Andrew Canion</a> had the same thought I did when I watched the video: you can do most of this in <a href=\"https://freron.com\">MailMate</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> At least the viewing, the &lsquo;The Feed&rsquo; kind of thing.

				"content_text": "\n\nOut to the supermarket today, because we were running low on a few things and our next delivery isn't arriving till Monday. It's the first time I've been out -- except to the back garden -- since the [bike incident](/blog/2020/04/07/the-last-bike-ride/). Admittedly that was only four days ago, but like everything now, it feels a lot longer.\n\nAnd I felt some trepidation about it. The world's a dangerous place: the very _air_ is dangerous, depending on who you get close to. And some you can't avoid, because pavements have a finite width, and some people _still_ walk blithely two-abreast, or on their own but down the middle... honestly, people, keep your distance.\n\nIn keeping with my [recent exhortation](/blog/2020/04/02/wear-a-mask-and-celebrate-your-immune-system/), I wore a mask. Just a bandana, but as I said there, anything is better than nothing. And hey, it reminded me of The Clash in the [\"Bankrobber\" video](https://youtu.be/ttJBdr6eBuo).\n\nSainsbury's was fine.

This is contrary to what we were told initially, but it makes complete sense even without technical analysis. <em>Anything</em> coming between someone else’s droplets and your lungs, or your droplets and someone else’s lungs, is better than <em>nothing</em> coming between them.</p>\n<p>It’s like wearing a cycling helmet: I’ve always thought that something between my head and the ground, should I come off, is better than nothing.</p>\n<p>And there are <a href=\"https://ragmask.com\">designs online for making masks</a> out of any old cloth. I feel <em>#blessed</em> that my daughter has an A-level in textiles and a sewing machine.</p>\n<p>On the question of masks, though, something has been confusing me since this all started. And to an extent, before that, really, when I’d occasionally see people out and about wearing what appeared to be a hospital-style mask. Which is, where did people get such things? How did they come to have what looked like professional medical supplies in their private possession? Aren’t these things <em>controlled</em>?</p>\n<p>Clearly not, for the last one. And I wondered <em>why</em>? Why did people have them? Now, that seems like a foolish question. And it ignores the cultural differences, whereby in parts of Asia it’s considered rude not to wear a mask if you are sick. Makes sense, though I always wonder how horrible it is if you sneeze while wearing one.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-6473-Rorschach\">\n“We’re not trapped in here with the coronavirus.

I don’t understand why, but cultures are different.</p>\n<p>Unlike <cite>Flights</cite>, it’s a complete, single story. It’s also much simpler. The narrator is an interesting character, though her practice of astrology adds nothing to the story and gets in its way to an extent.</p>\n<p>Each chapter has a quote from Blake as an epigraph.

They were yellow and they appeared on the front doors of houses. They said things such as DIPHTHERIA and SCARLET FEVER and WHOOPING COUGH. Milkmen – there were still milkmen in those years, sometimes with horse-drawn wagons – and bread men, ditto, and even icemen, and certainly postmen (and yes, they were all men), had to leave things on the front doorsteps. We kids would stand outside in the snow – for me, it was always winter in cities, as the rest of the time my family was up in the woods – gazing at the mysterious signs and wondering what gruesome things were going on inside the houses. Children were especially susceptible to these diseases, especially diptheria – I had four little cousins who died of it – so once in a while a classmate would disappear, sometimes to return, sometimes not.\n</p></blockquote>\n</body></html>\n",

It looked like this at about noon:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3608-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3608-1-scaled.jpeg\" class=\"aligncenter size-full\" alt=\"IMG 3608\" width=\"1857\" height=\"1392\" title=\"IMG_3608.jpeg\"></a></p>\n<p>The Levis shop was open. I was picking up some jeans that had been in for repair. That’s a good note for when this is all over, incidentally. If your Levis wear into holes or get torn, most of their shops offer a repair service now. They may have done for years; I only learned about it a month or so back. But it means that for significantly less than a new pair of jeans, I have <em>two</em> good-as-new pairs, including the ones which were <em>already</em> my favourites. One antidote to fast fashion.</p>\n<p>There was almost no-one around, and no-one was getting very close to anyone. In Lakeland I was able to get a refill (really, replacement) for one of our SodaStream CO<sub>2</sub> cylinders. But they didn’t have any new ones. It seems unlikely that those have been panic-bought, but <em>I</em> was thinking of getting an extra one in case it becomes hard to get replacements, so others might have been ahead of me.</p>\n<p>In and out within half an hour, and the parking was the least I’ve ever paid at Westfield: £3. I wouldn’t normally drive if I wasn’t buying much, but getting on the Overground would have been the opposite of social distancing.</p>\n<p>Or maybe not, if it had been as empty as the mall.</p>\n<p>But just yesterday I gave my daughter a lift to a friend’s house — same idea, avoid the bus — and up in Stamford Hill at around 4:30pm it was really busy with pedestrians. A lot of cars on the road, too. Maybe that was normal or less than, for that time on a Tuesday, though.</p>\n<p>Dropped into the wee Sainsbury’s on the way back. No fresh fruit or veg at all. Most tinned goods and bread gone — no toilet rolls, obviously — plenty of snacks and crisps, surprisingly. Either panic-buyers prefer healthy options, or Sainsbury’s are quicker at getting unhealthy supplies back.</p>\n<p>I have to confess to feeling a small amount of smugness at having stocked up over the last year or so. Brexit was the initial trigger, but I soon realised that having a supply of non-perishable items is actually pretty useful. If you can afford to buy a bit extra from time to time, and you’ve got the space to store it all, of course.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, meals are going to get dull really fast without a regular supply of fresh things.</p>\n<p>But if that’s the most we have to worry about, we’re doing better than many. I hope you are coping OK, dear reader.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I heard of this book — <a href=\"http://www.hpmor.com\">HPMOR</a>, as it’s known — from my son, a couple of years ago. Didn’t think about it for a while, and then recently I saw a tweet from a friend-of-friends, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ciphergoth\">@ciphergoth</a>:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The correct quote is \"There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/n3qAmdyhV2\">https://t.co/n3qAmdyhV2</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Agxq7FruRk\">pic.twitter.com/Agxq7FruRk</a></p>\n<p>— Paul Crowley (@ciphergoth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ciphergoth/status/1222276296492769280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The fact that it was a quote from Harry Potter, and that I didn’t recognise it — indeed, it didn’t seem like something Harry would say  — intrigued me, so I clicked through.</p>\n<p>And then I shortly found myself downloading the ebook and reading it for the next… actually, month or so.</p>\n<p>Because this book is <em>looooooong</em>! It’s a retelling of just the <em>first</em> Harry Potter book, along with much more, and it’s about half as long as all seven of the JKR originals.</p>\n<p>In fact, it could have done with an editor. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it has some weaknesses.</p>\n<p>First, the strengths, though. Yudkowsky can write a page-turner almost as well as Rowling. What we have here is an alternative universe in which Petunia Evans marries someone else, not Vernon Dursley. They adopt Harry, and bring him up in a loving home. Harry’s adoptive father is a scientist, which is where he learns his rationality. So his first thought when he discovers that magic exists is to try experiments to understand its capabilities and limits. Experimentation soon gets overwhelmed by events, though, as the plot gets going.</p>\n<p>There are other differences from the original, of course, and the end result is very different.</p>\n<p>Part of what Yudkowsky does is takes the literal translation of Voldemort’s name — “flees from death,” essentially — recognises the rationality of that feeling — who wouldn’t prefer going on living, to dying? — and builds from there.</p>\n<p>The major flaws are wordiness and couple of authorial tics that get repetitive and mildly annoying. He has a tendency to refer to people by their role, rather than their name: “The Defence Professor,” rather than “Quirrell,” for example. Which is fine if used sparingly, for variety. But he has people referring to other people like that, when they just wouldn’t.</p>\n<p>There’s also overuse of  scenes that start like, “The boy stood in the forest…” and only slowly revealing <em>which</em> boy. Again, fine occasionally, but he overdoes it.</p>\n<p>And a few Americanisms creep in: like calling the staff of Hogwarts the “faculty.” And anachronisms: nobody apologised for their snarkiness in 1992, since the word hadn’t been coined yet. Well, I could be wrong there: <a href=\"https://www.wordnik.com/words/snarky\">this site says</a> it goes back to 1906 or earlier. No-one in Britain, then.</p>\n<p>But I shouldn’t complain. It’s an astonishingly well-constructed work, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

When I saw the trailer (I think back in December, when we saw Knives Out) I was a bit freaked out by it. What’s this, you’ve got a film about a kid in the Hitler Youth, with Hitler as a character, and they seem to be playing it for comedy? This looks well dodgy.</p><p>My kids knew it was by Taika Waititi , though, and that seemed to make it likely to be OK? I dunno, but eventually I decided to give it a chance.</p><p>And it turns out to be really good. A sweet film in many ways, though with plenty of menace and darkness, as you'd expect from where and when it's set -- which is an unnamed German town or city in the dying days of the Second World War. Waititi himself plays Hitler, who is not in fact the real one, but an imaginary friend that lets Jojo, the ten-year-old title character, talk to someone about the things he can't talk to anyone else about.</p><p>So I enjoyed it, but I can't help asking: why did he choose to make this film? Why that story, why now? It's based on a novel, <cite>Caging Skies</cite> by Christine Leunens. But Wikipedia's description of it as \"the internationally bestselling Hitler Youth novel\" leaves me none the wiser.</p><p>Not, of course, that there has to be a specific reason for a creator to make something. And it's far from the first comedy about Hitler or the Nazis. But there's just something about the idea of it -- not the actuality -- that leaves me a little uncomfortable, in a way that The Great Dictator or The Producers didn't.</p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/devilgate/film/jojo-rabbit/\">See in Letterboxd</a></p>\n",

				"title": "The Memory Police by Yōko Ogawa (Books 2020, 2)",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Translated by Stephen Snyder. I asked for this for Christmas, because I saw it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/20/the-memory-police-yoko-ogawa-review\">reviewed</a> in <cite>The Guardian</cite> and it sounded interesting. And it is, but I had some problems with it.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the blurb:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <strong>Hat ribbon, bird, rose.</strong><br>\n  <br>\n  To the people on the island, a disappeared thing no longer has any meaning. It can be burned in the garden, thrown in the river or handed over to the Memory Police. Soon enough, the island forgets it ever existed.<br>\n  <br>\n  When a young novelist discovers that her editor is in danger of being taken away by the Memory Police, she desperately wants to save him. For some reason, he doesn’t forget, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to hide his memories. Who knows what will vanish next?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That “[f]or some reason” is where this book doesn’t quite work for me. The setup is fine: a type of item, and the memories, the very <em>idea</em> of that item, disappears. The titular police make sure that all instances of the item — roses, hats, photographs… — are removed. But some people keep their memories and the ideas, and try to keep the things. The Memory Police find them and cart them off.</p>\n<p>The protagonist’s mother was taken in that way when the protagonist was small.<sup id=\"fnref-6249-names\"><a href=\"#fn-6249-names\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Why is it happening? <em>How</em> is it happening? Who are the Memory Police, and what happens to the people they take? Can they be resisted, and how can the islanders get their memories back? These are the sorts of questions you would expect to have answered, were this a science fiction novel. Are the islanders the victims of some sort of mind-control experiment? Are they in a simulation?</p>\n<p>This is not a science fiction novel.</p>\n<p>“For some reason”. Don’t read this expecting to find out what the reason is, or to get answers to any of the other questions.</p>\n<p>All that said, I enjoyed reading it. The sense of danger, of menace, is palpable, but subtle. It’s about people trying to live their lives under these bizarre conditions. It’s just frustrating thinking about it now, about the unanswered questions.</p>\n<p>But maybe I’m reading it wrong. In her essay “<a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2010/01/18/sf-reading-protocols/\">SF reading protocols</a>,” Jo Walton writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  A reviewer wanted to make the zombies in Kelly Link’s “Zombie Contingency Plans” (in the collection <cite><a href=\"http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/titledetail.cfm?titleNumber=1185675\">Magic For Beginners</a>)</cite> into metaphors. They’re not. They’re actual zombies. They may also be metaphors, but their metaphorical function is secondary to the fact that they’re actual zombies that want to eat your brains. Science fiction may be literalization of metaphor, it may be open to metaphorical, symbolic and even allegorical readings, but what’s real within the story is real within the story, or there’s no there there. I had this problem with one of the translators of my novel <cite>Tooth and Claw</cite>—he kept emailing me asking what things represented. I had to keep saying no, the characters really were dragons, and if they represented anything that was secondary to the reality of their dragon nature. He kept on and on, and I kept being polite but in the end I bit his head off—metaphorically, of course.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The essay is largely about how there is a “toolkit” for reading SF — a set of understandings, of tropes — without which some can find the genre  difficult to understand. We learn that toolkit, or build it, from early reading of the genre. But she follows the above quote with this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  When I read literary fiction, I take the story as real on the surface first, and worry about metaphors and representation later, if at all. It’s possible that I may not be getting as much as I can from literary fiction by this method, in the same way that the people who want the zombies and dragons to be metaphorical aren’t getting as much as they could.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe that’s what went wrong for me with <cite>The Memory Police</cite>: Ogawa wrote a metaphorical work — about people trying to live their lives under bizarre conditions, as I wrote above. I read it with the expectation that the bizarre conditions would have an explanation, and they don’t, because they are “only” metaphors.</p>\n<p>For, I would have to suppose, a totalitarian state, where the slightest infraction of arcane and obscure laws leads to being carted away by the secret police.</p>\n<p>We also get sections of the novel the protagonist is writing. It is about a woman who loses her voice, and communicates using a typewriter. Then the typewriter is taken away from her. It works as a metaphor for the situation the protagonist lives in: a metaphor within a metaphor.</p>\n<p>And from the <cite>Guardian</cite> review that started this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  Why this is happening is unknown; the ideology of totalitarian control and cultural isolation is implied, rather than explicitly outlined, and its intersection with the supernatural strengthens the feeling of allegory.\n</blockquote>\n<p>So maybe I should have been warned. Calling it “supernatural” suggests something more in the magic realism vein. That might be a better way to approach it. Magic needs — or at least, generally gets — less of an explanation.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-6249-names\">\nNote the lack of names, too: the editor is given an initial, <em>R</em>, but the only character given an actual name is a dog. <a href=\"#fnref-6249-names\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

We fought, we lost, and now we’ve got to live with the consequences.</p>\n<p>Which won’t really start to take effect until the start of next year, of course, because we’ll be in the transition period until then. Until 2021 we’ll still be able to travel freely; there will be no added tariffs on goods; food standards will still be the high ones we’re used to.</p>\n<p>Ah yes, food standards. Just the other day I had a realisation — no, it was something that I already knew. More a dawning fear of how close a bad thing was. What brought it home was this headline in the <cite>Independent</cite>: “<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-chlorinated-chicken-us-trade-deal-boris-johnson-pompeo-trump-a9310081.html\">Brexit: US insists chlorinated chicken must be on menu in any UK trade agreement</a>.”</p>\n<p>Obviously no-one’s going to force anyone to buy or eat chicken, chlorine-washed or otherwise. But remember <em>why</em> chicken in the US is washed in chlorine, and why importing it into the EU is banned: it’s because the food standards are significantly lower than those in the EU. The chlorine washing is to kill off bacteria and make the meat fit for human consumption.</p>\n<p>So what that headline means is that a US trade deal could depend on the UK lowering its food standards. That’s what Brexit means: our government could choose to lower the standards of hygiene required in food production. Sit with that thought for a while.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of good things to think about on this bleak day. Both of those are also from America, and neither has anything to do with Brexit.

Not all of them. of course, but many. And that includes some of the Christmas carols. A full choir singing ‘Hark the Herald Angels Sing,’ or ‘Oh Come All Ye Faithful’? I’m there.</p>\n<p>The <em>best</em> Christmas songs, though, <em>do</em> belong to the — let’s say — secular side of things. I have a hierarchy of my personal favourites. Things move around a bit, and very occasionally new ones arrive; and you won’t be surprised to learn that ‘Fairytale of New York’ remains unassailable in the top spot.</p>\n<p>One of my other favourites is Greg Lake’s 1975 hit, ‘I Believe in Father Christmas.’ Now, if you haven’t listened to the words too closely — written, I’m surprised to discover, by Peter Sinfield, of whom I had barely heard before researching this — you might think it’s a simple celebration of Christmas, set to a jaunty tune, much like Slade’s ‘Merry Xmas Everybody,’ from a couple of years earlier (and every year since). It’s not, though. It’s much darker and more interesting than that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  They sold me a dream of Christmas<br>\n  They sold me a Silent Night<br>\n  They told me a fairy story<br>\n  Till I believed in the Israelite\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>And that closing couplet:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Hallelujah, Noel, be it Heaven or hell<br>\n  The Christmas we get we deserve\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lake and Sinfield have argued that it’s not anti-religious or atheistic. Well, you can have your interpretation, guys. I know what I think.</p>\n<p>I mainly wrote this because I’ve wanted to use the line I’ve stolen as a title for years. And I’ll leave you with the wishes the song provides:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I wish you a hopeful Christmas<br>\n  I wish you a brave New Year\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think we’re all going to need some hope and some bravery in 2020.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Indeed, it could be said to be true of <em>all</em> literature, maybe all art. Moore’s use is more frequent than most, though: The <cite>Watchmen</cite> characters based on those from old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Comics\">Charlton Comics</a>; <cite>Marvelman</cite>/<cite>Miracleman</cite> a revival of Mick Anglo’s creation; <cite>Promothea</cite> digging into mythology and fiction, as <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/10/promethea-by-alan-moore-jh-williams-iii-mick-gray-todd-klein-books-2018-27/\">I wrote very positively about last year</a>; and so on.</p>\n<p>In the <cite>League</cite> it’s at its most explicit.

Even the subtitle of this one is from Shakespeare.</p>\n<p>There is, as I say, nothing wrong with any of that. It’s like sampling in music: it doesn’t matter that you’re using part of an earlier creation; what matters is what you <em>do</em> with it.</p>\n<p>And what Moore and O’Neil do with everything here is pretty spectacular. I won’t go into any detail, but suffice it to say that pretty much all the threads from the earlier volumes are tied up, and everything is over at the end. <em>Everything</em>.

And in any case, many wouldn’t have heard it until 1980. <sup id=\"fnref-6087-40years\"><a href=\"#fn-6087-40years\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Including me. I remember being at school, at the start of a term, so it must have been January, and Watty saying, “I envy you: you haven’t heard <cite>London Calling</cite> yet.” That idea of how important the first listen is. I’ve said similar things myself over the years, about various things.</p>\n<p>But honestly, I couldn’t tell you anything about my first hearing. I had probably heard the title track — it was a single, after all — and I went and bought the album, most likely at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Menzies\">John Menzies</a> in Dumbarton (though maybe at Hall Audio, the nearby hi-fi shop, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_Group\">Woolies</a>, or Boots, who used to sell records in those days). I do know it cost £3.99, because the band took a reduction in their royalties so it — a double album — could be sold at the same price as a single album. Excellent value, for one of the greatest records ever made.</p>\n<p>Though I paid for it a couple more times over the years. Someone walked off with my copy during a party at my student flat in Edinburgh.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>One interesting thing about this book that I don’t recall noticing when I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/2007/09/20/the-steep-approach.html\">read it twelve years ago</a> is that the story itself <em>is</em> the titular approach. We don’t get to Garbadale House until about two-thirds of the way through, and then the rest of it is set there. With a few flashbacks and <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">-forwards</span> thrown in to both sections.</p>\n<p>Banksie always plays with form and structure, and this is no exception. Not just the aforementioned directional flashes, but use of different viewpoint characters and tenses. Mostly it’s from the viewpoint of Alban McGill, one of the many members of the Wopuld family. Some scenes are from that of a cousin of his. There are even a couple of instances of promiscuous PoV, or “head-hopping,” where we get the thoughts of another character within the same scene.</p>\n<p>Also some parts switch to present-tense, while most if it is past. There doesn’t seem to be any obvious function to those switches: it’s not like the tense reflects the timeline within the story. It seems arbitrary, almost random — though maybe I’m missing something there.</p>\n<p>None of this harms the story, it’s just worth noting. The strangest of these devices is that there are three or four sections in first-person, from the PoV of a minor character. All the rest is third-person. That gives the impression that this character is more significant than he is. The text in those sections is also rendered with spelling mistakes and grocer’s apostrophes, as if it was the direct transcript of what this relatively poorly-educated character has scribbled down.</p>\n<p>What’s the point of all that? I’m not sure. Just writerly games, maybe. I wonder if it suggests that Banks didn’t think the story itself was interesting enough to sustain the narrative, which might be a valid criticism. A well-off family with a secret at its heart has to decide whether to sell its business. The secret comes out, but it doesn’t make much difference. It would be significant to the characters affected, but we hardly see them after the reveal.</p>\n<p>Endearing characters, though, and even on a second read (I didn’t recall the secret), it keeps the pages turning.</p>\n<p>As I said twelve years ago, “In a book like this, the pleasure is in the journey more than the destination.”</p>\n</body></html>\n",

They would say: <strong>‘But it’s on Facebook – how can there be something that isn’t true?’</strong> They think there are gatekeepers but there aren’t.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Emphases mine.

We’ll get a hard Brexit starting in a month and a half (and taking years and years before it “gets done,” of course). We’ll see more privatisation in the NHS. We’ll see more austerity, I don’t doubt, despite the spending pledges that might have been in the Tory manifesto. And we’ll see moves to restrict what parliament and the courts can do to protect ordinary people.</p>\n<p>Our best hope is that Johnson is incompetent, and that’s not something we should have to rely on.</p>\n<p>What is wrong with this country? Why do people continue to vote against not just the interests of the most vulnerable in society, but against their <em>own</em> self interest?</p>\n<p>On Twitter a lot of people are blaming Corbyn, and I think they’re right. I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/12/10/fear-and-loathing-all-over-the-land/\">said just the other day</a> that I didn’t understand the dislike; but a thread by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/RussInCheshire\">@RussInCheshire</a> has helped to clarify my thinking. This regards not so much why people generally dislike him, but why he was ineffectual or worse as a leader. The key points:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  People will say “the media is biased”. Yes. But that’s the environment Labour leaders always operate in. Complaining about it is like trawler captains complaining the sea is wet. Yep. Learn to thrive in those conditions, or get off the boat.</p>\n<p>  People will say “they treated him worse than any previous leader”. They did. Cos he was shit at working the press, had a history of opinions that could be easily made to look awful, was inept on antisemitism, shifty on Brexit and cantankerous on TV.</p>\n<p>  People will say “no way is he racist”. Perhaps. But if people accused me of antisemitism, I’d be able to clearly defend myself, demonstrate my credentials, and put in place a strategy to stop accusations. He couldn’t. If he’s not antisemitic, he’s inept.</p>\n<p>  People will say “voters love him in person”. I’m sure. But we’ve been in the age of broadcasting for 80 years. What the hell use is being warm and cuddly to 600 people in a field, when you come over badly to 60 million people on TV?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The thread <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RussInCheshire/status/1205249028637806592\">starts here</a>, but it might be easier to read <a href=\"https://threader.app/thread/1205249028637806592\">here, as expanded</a> by the <a href=\"https://threader.app\">Threader App</a>.</p>\n<p>I still don’t understand — I never will — people who switch from Labour all the way to Conservative. They just vox-popped someone on the telly who used to vote Labour, but “couldn’t, in conscience,” vote for them with Corbyn as leader. Fair enough. But she voted Tory. Why go all the way over to the party that diametrically opposes the values she claims to support, when there are other progressive parties, that support some of those values. The party she voted for opposes those values.</p>\n<p>Baffling. Utterly baffling.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Or at least, I understand The Fear.</p>\n<p>I understand the fear of Brexit; of giving the Tories control, yet again, of the NHS, and of <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2011/01/05/republicans-good-at-theatre-dreadful-at-governing/\">the economy</a>; and of their plans for <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/tory-manifesto-conservative-boris-johnson-dictator-general-election-brexit-a9216861.html\">changing the constitution</a> in all the wrong ways, since I feel it myself.</p>\n<p>But despite my <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/11/10/ex-corbyn-fan/\">problems</a> with <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/11/11/deeds-not-words/\">Corbyn</a>, I don’t understand the loathing for him. It doesn’t seem to come from dislike of his policies. Some of the people who say they don’t like or don’t trust him seem to be Labour voters, who you’d expect to have similar beliefs. Even if those people have more centrist beliefs, you’d think they’d be close enough to the party’s current policies  not to be put off totally.</p>\n<p>It seems almost to be <em>personal</em>. Do some people dislike him as a person? Strikes me as odd, as he comes across as quite moderate and reasonable to me. To be sure, he can get snappy with interviewers at times, but it’s nothing compared to some people. And at least he doesn’t bluster; doesn’t lie; and always gives the impression that he knows what he’s talking about.</p>\n<p>Yet some people say they don’t trust him. Sometimes those same people say they <em>do</em> trust Johnson, even as they acknowledge he lies. It’s unfathomable.</p>\n<p>On tonight’s <cite>Channel 4 News</cite> they interviewed a guy in Johnson’s constituency who claimed to be a socialist, but who is going to vote for Johnson this time. They didn’t push him for an explanation.</p>\n<p>In the same constituency there was a business owner who had always voted Tory but is <em>not</em> going to this time, because of the way the party has been taken over by the far right. It takes a Tory businessman to recognise what a “socialist” can’t. We are through the looking glass and no mistake.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I’ll be voting Green. I hope everyone reading this will get out and vote on Thursday, for anyone who isn’t the Tories, and to stop Brexit.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I succumbed. As I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/11/14/watchmen-by-alan-moore-dave-gibbons-books-2019-21/\">suggested I might</a>.</p>\n<p>It felt a little grubby, going to the NowTV site and setting up an account. As you know, Sky TV and I have a history. Or maybe an anti-history, insofar as I am anti everything that their former owner stands for. But the key word is “former.” With Comcast now owning it, I can feel a little better about giving them my time and possibly some money.</p>\n<p>Still, though: grubby.</p>\n<p>But what’s worse, as a viewing experience, is that their app is the worst video-playback app I’ve ever used. It’s fine at all the basics; it even has a ten-second jump back and forward feature, which is good. But! It completely fails at subtitles.</p>\n<p>Now,  in this era — this platinum age of television — subtitles are often an essential part of viewing. And that isn’t true just due to my age, because my kids, who are young adults, are at least as likely as us olds to want them on. Mumblecore actors are to blame. Or maybe bad sound on our TV. Or a combination. Doesn’t matter. We watch with subtitles on <em>a lot</em> of the time, and I wanted them on for <cite>Watchmen</cite>.</p>\n<p>But NowTV — in its Mac app, at least — just can’t handle them properly. They either freeze, so you get the same sentence stuck on the screen for five minutes; or they just get out of sync. Sometimes they rush through minutes of text at a time, as if trying to catch up. In the end I turned them off.</p>\n<p>But I watched one episode on my iPad, and the subtitles were fine there. So I guess it is the actual Mac app. The Mac plugged into the telly is an old one. A <em>nine-year-old</em> MacBook Pro, in fact. I’m impressed that it’s still working, though I did <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2016/04/27/i-upgraded-my-macbook/\">upgrade it at one point</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that can’t be the reason it’s bad, because I’ve also tried it on my 2017 MBP, with exactly the same results.</p>\n<p>But what about the programme?</p>\n<p>It’s a sequel to the comic, set around thirty years later. I found the first episode kind of annoying, though I’m not quite sure why. Too much of it set in the past, maybe? But as we’ve got to know the characters and things have moved along, it’s definitely interesting. I’ve watched the first five episodes so far. Up to which point it’s kind of a cop show with an unusual background. Cops go masked so that criminals can’t identify them. Criminals go masked too, of course, specifically in Rorscach-style black and white masks.</p>\n<p>And there’s a mysterious old guy who puts on plays reenacting the origin of <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Osterman\">Doctor Manhattan</a>. You’ll have guesses about who he is, if you know the source material. Well, one guess.</p>\n<p>I like the way they’ve built on the comic, and are weaving the backstory in. Though I think it must be extremely confusing for anyone who hasn’t read the novel, or at least seen the movie.</p>\n<p>My main question (apart from the obvious ones, like what’s going on with Veidt?) is: why is <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Laurie_Juspeczyk\">Laurie</a> using her father’s surname? It doesn’t make sense to me that she’d call herself Blake, instead of Juspeczyck.</p>\n<p>Oh, and whatever happened to <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Dan_Dreiberg\">Dan Dreiberg</a>? I want to see some Nite owl action. Something that looked a lot like the <a href=\"https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Owlship\">Owlship</a> appeared in the first episode, so maybe he’ll turn up. As, I imagine, will Doctor Manhattan.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Plenty of non-Jewish people are put off by it too.</p>\n<p>There are two things I don’t understand.</p>\n<p>If there are antisemites in Labour (which, again, does seem to be the case): why and how? Who are these people that have joined a party of the left, a party that has always been anti-nazi, anti-racist, pro equality and human rights — who join it, and yet stand in direct opposition to its core values? It’s like a climate-change denier joining the Green Party.</p>\n<p>Further, why now? Why has this blown up in the last couple of years? These invasive members presumably haven’t <em>just</em> joined the party. It’s hard to imagine that they joined because of Corbyn being the leader.</p>\n<p>Unless that’s exactly what it is. Maybe Corbyn’s seeming weakness on responding to the problem. and/or a willful misunderstanding of his stance on Palestine and the government of Israel, has attracted such people to the party. In which case — in any case — the obvious thing to do is to find them and eject them; just as they can easily eject members who suggest voting for another party.</p>\n<p>I see that <cite>The Guardian</cite> has published an “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/antisemitism-labour-everything-you-need-to-know\">everything you need to know</a>” guide on the matter.

The fifth volume (or second volume of the second series) was out, but the sixth and final wasn’t.<sup id=\"fnref-5943-whitegold\"><a href=\"#fn-5943-whitegold\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> I waited on tenterhooks.<sup id=\"fnref-5943-tenter\"><a href=\"#fn-5943-tenter\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup> Eventually the hardback came out, but it was much too expensive for a poor student like me. Luckily, not for another poor student on my corridor, who lent it to me.</p>\n<p>I learnt my lesson, back then. More or less: I was reading <cite>Harry Potter</cite> while it was still being written. But this is one of the main reasons why I never started <cite>A Game of Thrones</cite>, for example.</p>\n<p>But here we are. Two-thirds of the way in to a compelling, thrilling story… actually that’s not quite right, what with <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/05/20/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-the-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-books-2018-12/\">the first volume</a> being prequel. More like halfway through a very long story, and all I can say is… not very much without going into massive spoilers.</p>\n<p>I like that Lyra is using Silvertongue as her surname: a name she was given, that she <em>earned</em>. There are aspects of the world, of Lyra’s relationship to it, that are surprising, given what she went through in <cite>His Dark Materials</cite>. But then, it <em>is</em> eight years later, and she has grown up a lot.</p>\n<p>Politics and events in the world of the Magisterium sometimes parallel those in our world.</p>\n<p>It’s a lot darker and more adult-themed than the original trilogy. I don’t know if the whole will end up being as legendary or as moving as the original, of course, but at this point, balanced on the fulcrum of change, I like it almost as much.</p>\n<p>I lied at the the start: you <em>should</em> read this book.

Corbyn was, predictably, calmer, more sensible, and less blustering. He needed to answer the “What way would you campaign in a second referendum” question that Johnson kept going back to, but otherwise he handled it pretty well.</p>\n<p>Johnson, of course, is the epitome of bluster, barely gave a straight answer to anything, and went over his allotted time on every question, as well as his opening and closing statements.</p>\n<p>I criticise him for that since he was violating the agreed-upon format. But the time-limited questions may have been the worst part of the event. The purpose is to limit bloviation, I suppose, but it seemed like often the chair was cutting the speaker off while they were still trying to make a point. I saw a tweet while it was going on, to the effect that part of the problem in politics is that everything is reduced to soundbites, with no opportunity to go into details. I’m inclined to agree.</p>\n<p>However, much more interesting, and a bettter format, was the interviews, an hour later, with the leaders of the some of the other parties: Jo Swinson, Nicola Sturgeon, Siân Berry of the Greens, and, unfortunately, Nigel Farage.</p>\n<p>One interviewer, one interviewee at a time, and it was all much more sensible. That is, in part, because of the people involved, of course. The three women were all good, especially Wee Nicola, as we like to call her. But perhaps it wouldn’t have worked so well if Johnson had been in the interviewee’s chair. He’d have been havering and talking over the interviewer, no doubt. Though to be fair, Farage managed not to do that, so who knows.</p>\n<p>But overall, I think that the debate format is not the best way to present your ideas.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Maybe it’s because he’s the only one that gets much screen time where he talks.</p>\n<p>On that note, two points about Mrs Coulter’s daemon, one which struck me on my recent reread, and the other just tonight.

The Murdochs no longer own Sky TV, so I can let myself watch it.</p>\n<p>But then we have the other ethical question, about <cite>Watchmen</cite> in particular.

Maybe it’s just be that he expects to get a majority, and thereby make it easier to get the WAB through in a new parliament. But I can’t help thinking that he’s up to something.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Almost exactly a year ago I started reading a novel, then put it on hold. This year I’ve done the same, for different reasons.</p>\n<p>I started <cite>The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet</cite> by Becky Chambers in October of last year. I quickly put it aside as November approached. I realised that it — or at least its start — was much too similar to the <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/31/5196/\">novel that I planned to start for NaNoWriMo</a>.</p>\n<p>I haven’t got back to it yet.</p>\n<p>This year it was the new Philip Pullman, <cite>The Book of Dust vol 2: The Secret Commonwealth</cite></p>\n<p>Now, you’ll recall that I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/05/20/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-the-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-books-2018-12/\">said I might do this</a> after I read the first of the new trilogy. Other things got in the way of that, though.</p>\n<p>So I read a chapter or two of the new one, and realised I needed to refresh my memories. There’s a whole thing that we learn about at once that I don’t remember. Or at least don’t remember how it happened.</p>\n<p>There’s also a TV series coming. I was aware it was in development, but not of how soon it was going to be. Turns out it’ll be on in a week or two.</p>\n<p>So now I’m worried that  watching it is going to be a bit like the recent <cite>Good Omens</cite> series was for me; really well done, I appreciated it… but I had <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/05/21/good-omens-by-terry-pratchett-and-neil-gaiman-books-2019-6/\">re-read the book</a> too soon before watching it, meaning it was all just a bit too recent in my memory for maximum enjoyment. But we’ll cross that ice bridge to another world when we come it it. The trailers look great, anyway.</p>\n<p>The difference with this year’s pause will be that, while I will get back to the Chambers eventually, I’m obviously not in any hurry to do so. Whereas I fully expect to restart <cite>The Secret Commonwealth</cite> as soon as I’ve recovered from the ending of <cite>The Amber Spyglass</cite>. Which I’ll probably be starting quite soon.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I don’t really care for dystopias, <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2015/09/08/station-eleven-by-emily-st-john-mandel-books-2015-8/\">as I’ve said before</a>. Interesting that the book I linked to there had just won the Clarke, and the one we’re discussing was the inaugural winner of that award.</p>\n<p>For the first few chapters I was distracted by wondering how this situation, this state, could have come to be. Strangely what I found difficult to cope with was not the restrictions, the rolling back of rights — they are horrific, but I could and can easily imagine an America (or, hell, maybe even a Britain) that could enact those laws.</p>\n<p>No, what I found hardest to believe in was the dress codes. The way not just the Handmaids, but the marthas (domestic servants), econowives (lower-class, probably infertile women, assigned to lower-class men) and even Wives (the wives of the ruling-class men) all dress in the standard costume of their class.</p>\n<p>Somehow I feel — or at least felt — that it would be harder to get everyone to dress the same way than to obey laws that restrict more important freedoms.</p>\n<p>As the chapters went on, those concerns evaporated. The telling of the backstory through Offred’s reminiscences outlines a convincing route from 80s America to Gilead. Though a lot more could be told: it is only an outline. Still, it’s enough.</p>\n<p>These days, with actual nazis poisoning our political discourse, and attempts to roll back reproductive rights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/06/french-protests-against-ivf-treatment-for-gay-and-single-women\">even in France</a>, it sometimes feels — as Atwood no doubt intended — that Gilead is not so much a fable as a warning.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Don’t read on if you haven’t seen it and care about being spoiled.</p>\n<p>Or maybe “buddy pic,” rather than “love story;” but the relationship between the two leads will be analysed for its homoerotic content, no doubt.</p>\n<p>How it certainly <em>has</em> been described is “a love letter to Hollywood,” and that’s fair enough. What it also is, is a counter-factual, or alternative history. But don’t worry, I’m not going to claim this one for SF.<sup id=\"fnref-5837-sf\"><a href=\"#fn-5837-sf\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The main characters – fading cowboy actor Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his regular stunt double Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt – are invented. But most of the other named characters, and many who are mentioned or appear as extras, are real people. The most significant of these is Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie. And it’s her story that makes this film most interesting, and maybe problematic.</p>\n<p>Because of course she died tragically, murdered by members of Charles Manson’s “Family” cult. And in this version — she doesn’t.</p>\n<p>If you know the history — which of course, many younger people won’t, which makes for different ways of experiencing the film — then you spend half the time expecting the massacre. There are captioned dates, and even though most of us wouldn’t know the date of the murders, there can’t really be any other reason for showing them. And then when it comes, something else happens.</p>\n<p>The violence in that scene is gruesome, over the top, ludicrous — almost hallucinogenic, making me wonder if the tripping Booth<sup id=\"fnref-5837-transgressor\"><a href=\"#fn-5837-transgressor\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> is meant to have hallucinated some or all of it. But there’s no need for there to be so much of it, or for the majority of it to be directed at women. The “Family” did consist largely of women, I guess, but I can’t help but feeling that Tarantino is revelling in it a little too much.</p>\n<p>And on top of all that, as my family agreed after seeing it: there’s no real <em>need</em> for the whole Sharon Tate thread of the story. It would have made a fine tale if were just about the two actors against the backdrop of late-60s Hollywood. I wonder what the point of it was. Did Tarantino feel he could in some way “save” Sharon Tate?</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5837-sf\">\nAlthough that might be an interesting exercise. There isn’t really enough <em>after</em> the big change to make it worthwhile, though. <a href=\"#fnref-5837-sf\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5837-transgressor\">\nThere’s probably no significance to his having the same surname as the killer in David Lynch’s <cite>Blue Velvet</cite>.

I think I saw a tweet, or something, thought it looked interesting, and instantly bought it because it was only a few quid on Kindle. It’s a huge book which tries — successfully, in my mind — to explain how the bulk of David Lynch’s creative works can be considered part of a single story, which Horton refers to as <cite>The Dream</cite>.</p>\n<p>Now obviously <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, <cite>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</cite>, and <cite>Twin Peaks: The Return</cite> are all part of the same story. As are the various spinoff books: Jennifer Lynch’s <cite>The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer</cite>, and Scott Frost’s <cite>The Autobiography of FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes</cite>, from back around the time of the original broadcast; and Mark Frost’s more recent <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/03/the-secret-of-twin-peaks-by-mark-frost-books-2017-1/\">The Secret History of Twin Peaks</a></cite> and <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/02/27/twin-peaks-the-final-dossier-by-mark-frost-books-2018-4/\">Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier</a></cite>, which I’ve written about here.</p>\n<p>But Horton argues that the whole story gets kicked off in <cite>Eraserhead</cite>, and that <cite>Blue Velvet</cite>, <cite>Lost Highway</cite>, <cite>Mulholland Dr</cite> and <cite>Inland Empire</cite> are side stories related to the main branch. The overall story being about an eternal being, The Dreamer, who dreams reality into existence, and also creates another being, known as Jowday, or Judy, who becomes his adversary. BOB, the possessing spirit of the original <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, is a creation of this entity, and the Black and White Lodges are the vanguards in the battle between the two beings.</p>\n<p>Sure, on one level it’s just good vs evil, heaven &amp; hell — “just,” I say, as if that wasn’t enough. But the sheer scope of it is astonishing. The eighteen hours of <cite>The Return</cite> has been hailed as an incredible masterpiece of visual storytelling. But when you include all that I’ve listed above, and three of Lynch’s paintings to boot — it must be one of the greatest — in terms of size, at least — creative works by a single visionary. True, it’s far from being by a single <em>creator</em>, but the vision behind it is solely or primarily Lynch’s, or that of Lynch and Mark Frost.</p>\n<p>And even if the connections to the other films are just in Horton’s head (and, to be fair, those of others whose work he acknowledges): the obviously-connected stuff is still amazing, and the current work, Horton’s book that I’m writing about, is something a of a creative triumph itself.</p>\n<p>One that is slightly marred by its self-published nature and obvious lack of an editor — there are a <em>lot</em> of typos — but a hugely impressive one nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Though obviously it’s only for the very serious <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> fan.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I had vaguely seen references to “ratios,” and was aware it was something to do with engagement on Twitter and elsewhere. But I hadn’t understood what exactly people meant by it. Then last night I saw a tweet in which someone said, “I accept I’ve been ratiod.” (Should the verb form rather be “ratioed”? Hard to say. Neither looks quite right.)</p>\n<p>A search for understanding led me to <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-ratio\">this article on  Know Your Meme</a>.  It tells us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The Ratio refers to an unofficial Twitter law which states that if the amount of replies to a tweet greatly outnumbers the amount of retweets and likes, then the tweet is bad\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>and goes into some detail about the origin of the term.</p>\n<p>It makes me sad to read that. Imagine an interaction system where, if people reply to something you say, that’s bad. Well, it seems we don’t have to imagine it: we can see it right here on the “social” web.</p>\n<p>I like to get replies on Twitter or elsewhere. A reply means, to me, that someone has read what I’ve written, thought about it, and found it worth responding to. I’m aware that I speak from a position of some privilege, in that I’m not in a group that is likely to experience the mass abuse that many do. But something has broken down in our systems of interaction if getting replies mean what you said “is bad.”</p>\n<p>I’m far from the first to have made that observation, of course.</p>\n<p>But consider <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a>, the still-young social network based on blogs that I’ve <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/02/02/success-for-micro-blog/\">written abut before</a>. Micro.blog has replies, but it doesn’t even have the concept of likes or retweets/reblogs. If you read a post and want to say something about it — even just that you like it — you have to reply.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Back when the internet was young — or at least the commercial, available-at-home internet — I sent an email with the  subject line, “Bicycle on the Superhighway”. It was about me having a publicly-accessible email address for the first time since uni (as opposed to one that was only usable within the company where I worked at the time).</p>\n<p>This was back when people — inspired, if I recall correctly, by Al Gore — were calling the net the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_superhighway\">Information Superhighway</a>.”</p>\n<p>This post is not about all that, though; this is about literal cycling on a literal superhighway: specifically London’s “<a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/routes-and-maps/cycle-superhighways\">Cycle Superhighways</a>.”</p>\n<p>Since the building where I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2019/05/08/new-job-obtained/\">now work</a> has showers, I decided it was time to get back on the bike. And since it’s in Westminster, it turns out there’s a really easy route, that uses CS6 and CS3: down Farringdon Road and west along Embankment, by the river.</p>\n<p>These are fantastic cycling facilities, especially the Embankment one. Properly separated from the motor traffic, plenty of room to move and overtake, great sequencing of traffic lights so you hardly have to stop. It’s hard to fault it. Especially compared to nearly every other pathetic painted cycle lane in the city.</p>\n<p>It gets a bit hairy where it all ends, in Parliament Square: the traffic there is unfeasibly heavy. Who drives near parliament?</p>\n<p>If there’s a downside to it all, it’s this: I suspect that the motorised traffic is busier and faster, exactly because it’s not tempered by having bikes in the mix. I can’t be sure — I’ve never used Embankment before, and it’s years since I used to cycle regularly on Farringdon Road — but it feels to me that there’s a crazy amount of traffic and that it’s going faster than ever.</p>\n<p>The latter can’t really be true — there are still speed limits, and they either won’t have changed or might have dropped to 20 mph in sections. But I still get this sense that, freed from interacting with the fragile two-wheeled minority, the armoured legions behave more like they’re on a motorway.</p>\n<p>Whether that’s the case or not, the number of people cycling — especially in the recent bright spring weather — is huge. The only time I’ve seen more cyclists together was when I did the London to Brighton ride many years ago.</p>\n<p>And also in the mix now are electric scooters and electric skateboards, which makes it all the more interesting. There’s even the odd cycle rickshaw.</p>\n<p>It’ll be interesting to see how the volume changes with the seasons, but you can’t beat it for a way to commute: it’s faster than the tube, it saves you money, and you get some exercise. I recommend it for anyone who’s able.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Not that I was involved in the events, but I was distantly aware of at least some of them. In the years the book covers I was between 12 and 15. Or maybe just 14, as it only gets as far as early 79. It’s a short period of time, looking back, and they — the Pistols, and most of the other bands too — were incredibly young. They were just 20 and 21 when they signed their first deal. And their second. And their third.</p>\n<p>At times Savage appears to think that punk was over when the pistols split, if not before. And generally to have quite negative thoughts about it as it developed Though he undercuts that contempt later, in the appendices and in the notes scattered through the huge discography at the end. He acknowledges the influence of punk, though considers it just to be one of a range of genres or forms that influences popular music. Which is fair enough, though there are still, even today, bands that consider themselves to be punk. Whether that’s a good thing or not, I don’t know.</p>\n<p>Something that came out of it that surprised me — though doesn’t, now that I know the facts — is that you can no longer get the film of <cite>The Great Rock ‘n’ Roll Swindle</cite> in any form (though you can still get the soundtrack album). That’s because it was McLaren’s project, it sets him up as hero, and makes Lydon the almost-unseen villain. Lydon hated McLaren by the end, and eventually won control of the Sex Pistols name and assets in a series of court cases. Presumably he controls whether it will ever be released.</p>\n<p>I find this mildly annoying, because I saw it couple of times when I was a student, and enjoyed it, and wouldn’t mind seeing it again. Second-hand DVD copies are available, but they’re mostly pricey and/or being shipped from the States.</p>\n<p>I suppose the more recent, documentary film, <cite>The Filth and the Fury</cite>, might be worth seeing. I see that, like <cite>The Swindle</cite>, it is directed by Julien Temple. Clearly Lydon didn’t mind <em>his</em> work on McLaren’s film.</p>\n<p>What doesn’t come through very much is any sense of Jon Savage himself. What was he doing, and how did he get involved in all this? I gather he wrote a fanzine, <cite>London’s Outrage</cite>, and he became a journalist writing for <cite>Sounds</cite>, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Savage\">his Wikipedia entry</a>. While he has done extensive research, and interviewed many of the participants, some of the story clearly comes from his being there at the time.</p>\n<p>But the only real sense of that we get is that, towards the last third or so of the book, a series of dated, italicised entries appear. They clearly are — or are meant to be — diary entries from the time. Or notes for articles he wrote at the time, perhaps, giving us something of a first-person view of some to the gigs and so on. I would have liked to see more made of these, or more generally about his experience and from his point of view. A book about punk ought to be a bit more gonzo, I think.</p>\n<p>But on the whole it’s a great read.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>You could spend a lot of time wondering what makes Theresa May tick.</p>\n<p>She says she supported remain and voted to stay in the European Union. So her increasing fervour for Brexit has been one of the most confusing factors in British politics over the last two and a half years.</p>\n<p>Taking over the Tory leadership after David Cameron resigned was always going to be a poisoned chalice. No-one would have had a good time in that position, except maybe a genuine hard quitter like Jacob Rees-Mogg. That’s probably why Gove and Johnson pulled out.</p>\n<p>If she truly believed that staying in was best, though, she would not have rushed into triggering Article 50 (nor would she have gone to court to fight for her wish to do so by diktat; luckily National Hero Gina Miller had the nation’s back on that one).</p>\n<p>If she had used more care, collaboration, and consideration, she might have had an easier time when Article 50 finally was triggered and the negotiations started. In fact if she had been more thoughtful in the first place she might even have said something like, “The vote was close; the country is clearly divided. We will discuss the possible ways forward in parliament and with the rest of the EU, and come back to you, the people, for confirmation when we better understand what Brexit means.” <sup id=\"fnref-5415-brexitmeans\"><a href=\"#fn-5415-brexitmeans\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>But no: “Brexit means Brexit”: she knew up front what it meant, and never deviated. Even if the majority of the country had no idea what it would mean.</p>\n<p>She then proceeded as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ignore any idea of cross-party talks and so involving parliament (the UK’s sovereign body) in the negotiations;</li>\n<li>trigger Article 50 as soon as she could;</li>\n<li>negotiate with the EU27 almost in secret;</li>\n<li>have inflexible “red lines” to appease the hard quitters, leaving herself no room for compromise in the negotiations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s a truism, even a cliche, to say that she puts the Tory party before the country. But the only way I can explain such a dramatic change of heart is that her love for the Tory party overruled her knowledge that being in the EU was, is, and will be the best situation for the UK. And that she somehow convinced herself that she could heal her fatally-divided party.</p>\n<p>In fact, the very thing that Cameron was trying to do by calling he referendum in the first place.</p>\n<p>“Tory eurosceptics” used to be a common enough phrase, but it denoted a tiny fringe of the party: a few loons like John Redwood. But in trying to appease them, two Tory leaders and prime ministers have turned them mainstream and brought us to where we are today, on the brink of leaving the EU without any kind of agreement for our future relationship.</p>\n<p>And their party is as divided as ever.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5415-brexitmeans\">\nThat’s fanciful, of course.

The subtitle is “Reagan, Thatcher, and the Last Stand of A Band That Mattered,”<sup id=\"fnref-5409-oxford\"><a href=\"#fn-5409-oxford\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> which captures well its structure. It interleaves the politics of what was happening on both sides of the Atlantic — the miners’ strike, Reagan’s nuclear brinksmanship, the Iran/Contra scandal — with what was happening with the most political of the original punk bands.</p>\n<p>It’s interesting to read a history of a time you lived through and were, however tangentially, involved in. Andersen and Heibutzki more than do justice to their material. The research they must have done is impressive. I know personally that Andersen came to the UK on a research trip, but aside from that they have interviewed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Howard\">three</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Sheppard\">non-original</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_White\">members</a> of The Clash, <a href=\"https://kosmovinyl.com/\">Kosmo Vinyl</a>, and various other people who were involved or just had something useful to say.</p>\n<p>And they must have spent a lot of time listening to concert tapes and studying set lists — which doesn’t sound like a chore to me, it’s fair to say.</p>\n<p>I learned two major things: first, I’d forgotten how good <cite>Cut the Crap</cite> is. I haven’t listened to it in ages, and when I went to do so on Apple Music, I found it isn’t there. Nor is it on Spotify. I have it on vinyl, but I don’t currently have access to a record player.</p>\n<p>Luckily Amazon and CDs both still exist, so I put some more money the way of… <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Rhodes\">Bernie Rhodes</a>, as it turns out.</p>\n<p>That’s the other big thing I found out: how — <em>difficult</em>, let’s say — Rhodes was. Not least since he signed the band — well, Joe and Paul: the others were effectively employees — into a contract that gave him, Rhodes, control over the album, as well as the name “The Clash.”</p>\n<p>But worse was the way he treated the new members while they were with the band. Constantly haranguing them, telling them they weren’t up to scratch, shouting at them… it’s a wonder they stayed. It sounds like an abusive environment.</p>\n<p>Joe could and should have stopped it, but it seems like he was still to some extent in Rhodes’s thrall — Bernie did bring the band together, after all — and possible suffering from depression. Certainly he was drinking heavily, and during that time his dad died and his mum got ill, and he became a father himself. It was a difficult time for him.</p>\n<p>I have more to say about the album, but I think that’s for a separate post. For now, this is a great rock book about a little-discussed time in the history of my favourite band.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5409-oxford\">\nGood to see the proper use of the Oxford comma there. <a href=\"#fnref-5409-oxford\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

Not least for the closing quote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “It’s not that Italian coffee has always been bad,” Campeotto said. “They have been geniuses. The god of coffee is the Italian espresso. The problem is, they have been stuck there. They stopped.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If they had already achieved the “god of coffee” (which I happen to agree with), then why would they do anything <em>other</em> than stop? If you’ve already achieved perfection you have no need to improve. Just make sure you maintain that level.</p>\n<p>I spent twelve months of 1989-90 in Turin. A cappuccino was 1200 lire, or about 60p (around 45-50 US cents, probably). And it was <em>delicious</em>. The best coffee I had, or have, ever tasted.</p>\n<p>The growth of Starbucks and the other chains came after that, and I’ve been looking for coffee as good ever since. I’ve never found it. The closest I ever found in London was Costa in its early days. It has slipped down to the level of Starbucks and Caffè Nero, though.</p>\n<p>Which is not to say that any of those are truly <em>bad</em>: not, at least, compared to what was available before they came on the scene.</p>\n<p>But nothing matches my memory of Torinese cappuccino.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Right, let’s get 2019 off to a start by talking about my favourite TV programme. I haven’t said anything about the recent season of <cite>Doctor Who</cite> here since my <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/07/5050/\">appreciative post</a> at the end of the first episode. Not for any reason other than not getting round to it.</p>\n<p>I absolutely love this iteration of the series. Jodie Whittaker is fantastic as The Doctor, and the supporting cast is brilliant as well. I like the crowded Tardis feel. It does have the limitation that some of the characters don’t get as much time or as many lines as others. That’s been notably true of Yaz — except in the “Demons of the Punjab” episode, of course.</p>\n<p>But there’s plenty of time for her to be developed further, assuming they’re all sticking around. And the focus being more on Ryan and Graham was entirely correct, since if there was an overarching theme to the season, it was grief.</p>\n<p>It’s not perfect. There have been several occasions when I’ve thought that the writing team don’t really understand what a galaxy is, or the scale of it. Lines like “half the people in the galaxy are unemployed,” or “they’ve crossed four galaxies to get here,” just don’t really make a lot of sense. And there have been several episodes where things maybe weren’t as tidily resolved as we’re used to.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s New Year special episode, “Resolution,” was a classic example of the kind of story where the ideas are good, but the whole thing could have been improved if they’d taken the time to come up with slightly better ways to make things happen. Some way of defeating the enemy that didn’t involve the microwave oven, for example. And the whole vacuum/supernova bit at the end was kind of farcical.</p>\n<p>But no matter. This season was all about the character dynamics, and those were great. It’s a strong start for Chris Chibnall as showrunner, and an incredibly strong start for Jodie Whittaker.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Which may be only three or four times. A friend got into Michener when we were teenagers. None of his books much interested me, until I looked at this.</p>\n<p>It’s a tale of hippies and others in 1969. Six young people from various countries meet each other in Torremolinos, and drift around the Iberian Peninsula and parts of Africa. The narrator, seemingly detached third-person at first, turns out to be an older man who knows some of the young people, and arranges business trips so that he can hang out with them from time to time.</p>\n<p>It’s about what was going on in the world — Vietnam, the Arab/Israeli conflict, drugs, music — and about the characters. They aren’t that well developed — indeed, he largely abandons character development after the first six chapters where he introduces each one — but those introductions are enough to see us through.</p>\n<p>Actually, thinking about it now, I wish he had written more about some of them. A sequel would have been in order.</p>\n<p>It’s partly, I suspect, Michener’s own struggle to come to terms with the way society is changing — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Michener\">he was born in 1907</a>, so he’d have been 62 at the time this is set. It was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drifters_(novel)\">published in 71</a>, so maybe a tad older when he wrote it. The narrator, George Fairbanks, is younger than that, I think — probably in his fifties, maybe even forties, but people seemed to become old at a younger age back then.</p>\n<p>Well worth a read.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

He didn’t come over just to interview me, I should stress. It was a research trip, and he visited various places and interviewed lots of people, some of my friends included.</p>\n<p>We’ve exchanged emails a couple of times since then, when he had followup questions, so I kind of expected to hear when the book came out. Coincidentally I was recently thinking about emailing him, to talk about something on the <a href=\"https://joestrummerfoundation.org/joe-strummer-001-archive-release/\"><cite>Joe Strummer 001</cite></a> collection of obscurities that came out a month or two back. Had I done so, I would of course have said, “So when’s the book coming out?”</p>\n<p>But here it is. I am extensively quoted (well, quoted a couple of times) in the section on the <a href=\"https://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_clashs_forgotten_years_1984_1986\">busking tour’s</a> visit to Edinburgh, which was mainly what he wanted me to talk about.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/we-are-the-clash/\">Here’s the publisher’s page</a> on it. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36436604-we-are-the-clash\">Here’s its GoodReads page</a>, and its <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clash-Reagan-Thatcher-Stand-Mattered/dp/1617752932\">Amazon UK</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clash-Reagan-Thatcher-Stand-Mattered/dp/1617752932\">US</a> links.

Sadly, after <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/11/30/a-five-and-four-zeroes/\">last year’s success</a>, this year <a href=\"https://nanowrimo.org/participants/devilgate/novels/delta-blues-beat-poet-of-the-spaceways/stats\">I failed</a>.</p>\n<p>As you’ll have seen if you clicked through to look at my stats, I averaged 595 words per day, for a total of 17,800. It’s not nothing, and it’s still a decent start on the new novel, but it’s nothing like last year.</p>\n<p>Why did I fail? A better question is, why was I successful last year? This year’s result is comparable to other years when I’ve tried it. Last year’s success looks like the aberration.</p>\n<p>The big difference between last year and any other was my commute. I’ve tended always to have a commute of about an hour — except when I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/02/recent-events-2/\">worked at the bank in the City</a>, when it was shorter. Last year I was working in Croydon, which took me an hour and a half or more to get to. The one good point was that, picking up the Overground from Dalston Junction, I nearly always got a seat within a few stops. And on the way back had one from the start (coming from West Croydon, which is the start of the line).</p>\n<p>So I was able to get forty or fifty minutes of concentrated writing time in each direction. Add to that the fact that the office I was in was really horrible, so I didn’t want to spend my lunch hours in it. I mostly went out and wrote in cafes or at <a href=\"https://www.boxpark.co.uk/croydon/\">Boxpark Croydon</a>. The one thing I miss about that job is the the places to eat, especially a little pizza place in Boxpark.</p>\n<p>Whereas now, working at Imperial, I’m back to a one-hour commute, with much less guarantee of a seat. And I really like both job and office, so I’m quite happy to go back there after I’ve got my lunch.</p>\n<p>One other point is that last year I had worked out how I was going to end the novel I had been working on for years, so I was running downhill towards that end. This year, starting a brand-new one — even though I’ve got a plan, it feels much more uphill.</p>\n<p>Still, we press on, writers against procrastination, borne forward ceaselessly into the future.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It is, in case you don’t know, a film from 1980 about and featuring The Clash. It’s kind of a fictionalised documentary, in that the titular character, Ray Gange, is both someone who was a sometime roadie for/hanger-on of The Clash, and playing the part of “Ray Gange.”<sup id=\"fnref-5250-Gange\"><a href=\"#fn-5250-Gange\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The worst part of it is, as I recalled, his “acting.” Well, that’s not quite true. Viewing it <em>as a film</em>, that’s the case. But viewing it as a document of the end of the seventies, the worst part of it is the casual racism. And indeed the organised racism of the National Front rally shown at the start.</p>\n<p>Also bad are the violence from police and bouncers, and the general horribleness of Britain in the seventies. Nothing looks clean, everything looks run-down or broken. It looks, in fact, far worse than I remember it being.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry, by the way, if you don’t remember what it was like, are too young to have experienced it, and/or don’t want to watch the film. It’ll be like that again in a couple of years if things go as we fear.</p>\n<p>The best parts are, of course, the scenes of The Clash live and in the studio. And we won’t get them back after Brexit.</p>\n<p>Also, in looking up the IMDB article, I discover that a) Ray Gange has actually been in a couple of other movies, and b) far more importantly, there is a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081441/\">2016 movie called <cite>London Town</cite></a>, which is a drama about those times. With people acting as The Clash. Whaaaat? Why did no-one tell me about this?</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5250-Gange\">\nOr not quite.

I’m done with Jeremy Corbyn. <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/interview-with-labour-leader-corbyn-we-can-t-stop-brexit-a-1237594.html\">This interview in <cite>Der Spiegel</cite></a>, in which he says “Brexit can’t be stopped,” is the clincher.</p>\n<p>As always, literally <em>everything else he says</em> is on the good side of politics — the side I tend to agree with, to be less judgmental. But he refuses to resist — even, really, to engage with<sup id=\"fnref-5198-march\"><a href=\"#fn-5198-march\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> — the thing that is the most important political issue and biggest political mistake of our lifetime (setting aside for the moment climate change, which is not just a political issue, and is global in scope, not just European). Look at this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Not just Labour, but the whole country is extremely divided at the moment — not least because of Brexit. If you could stop Brexit, would you?</p>\n<p>  <strong>Corbyn:</strong> We can’t stop it. The referendum took place. Article 50 has been triggered. What we can do is recognize the reasons why people voted Leave.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is that “will of the people” nonsense, the idea that it would be undemocratic to ask again. The will of the people can change, and almost certainly has. And you don’t agree to a deal with going back and checking that it’s still OK. Having a confirmatory referendum would be considerably <em>more</em> democratic than not having one.<sup id=\"fnref-5198-cut\"><a href=\"#fn-5198-cut\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> And we <em>can</em> stop it. Parliament, which is, and always was, sovereign, could revoke Article 50.</p>\n<p>Back to the interview:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I’ve been critical of the competitions policy in Europe and the move towards free market, and obviously critical in the past of their treatment of Greece, although that was mostly the eurozone that did that. My idea is of a social Europe with inclusive societies that work for everyone and not just for a few.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>You don’t build a “social Europe with inclusive societies that work for everyone and not just for a few” by leaving the EU! You build it by staying in, and working to build that society! God, it’s infuriating.</p>\n<p>I voted for him as leader, I respect and believe in most of his policies, but he needs to go. Labour won three general elections under Tony Blair, and was able to do a lot of good. They could have done more, they could have been better, and Blair destroyed his legacy by throwing his lot in with George W Bush and the Iraq War. But those were times when things were improving in the country and we looked to the future with positivity. It can be like that again.</p>\n<p>But it won’t — for decades at least — if we destroy our economy, hobble worker’s rights, and undercut food-safety regulations, by leaving the EU.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5198-march\">\nNote, for example, his complete absence from the country on the <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/10/22/march-in-october/\">day of the People’s Vote march</a>. <a href=\"#fnref-5198-march\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5198-cut\">\n“Measure twice, cut once,” as the old saying goes.

The main march started on Park Lane, so we were ahead of it, and it wasn’t clear to us whether the head of it had already passed us, or if not, then when it actually reached us. It looked like nothing was moving ahead of us. My assumption was that they hadn’t yet closed all the roads between us and Parliament Square, but there was no way to know for sure.

I knew it was about, or set around, a party — in part because I’ve seen <cite><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274558/\">The Hours</a></cite>.</p>\n<p>But it’s about so much more; and not really about the party very much at all. It’s an intriguing look at the mental lives of a range of people in London on a day in the 1920s. Not a very wide range of people, in that they’re all very much upper-middle to upper class. There are a few people from what would have been called the lower classes, but they’re just passersby, background colour. There is, however, a sympathy towards all people — from at least some of the characters.</p>\n<p>Given the limited range of types of people, we get a remarkably effective insight into their mental lives. And it’s all done with reported thought. There is some actual dialogue, but very little. And we jump around from head to head promiscuously, but incredibly smoothly. There’s usually some handoff: the current viewpoint character sees someone, and then we’re in that person’s head. Or they might just think about someone, and now we hear the other person’s thoughts.</p>\n<p>I guess this, along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce\">Joyce</a>, is one of the originators of the stream of consciousness as a literary device. An  interesting thing to me is how it reminded me of other, later, works; which of course shows its influence. Most noticeable: <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/04/10/the-illuminatus-trilogy-by-robert-shea-and-robert-anton-wilson-books-2018-7/\">Illuminatus</a>!</cite> Now <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson\">Robert Anton Wilson</a> was a Joyce scholar, so he was probably coming more from that direction, but there are definitely some similarities of style, or at least echoes.</p>\n<p>And — also from this year’s rereading — <cite><a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/08/01/walking-on-glass-by-iain-banks-books-2018-18/\">Walking On Glass</a></cite>. Especially in the contrast between the thoughts of people who are or are not “sane.”</p>\n<p>It can be surprisingly confusing at times, such as when someone suddenly thinks  of a person or an idea that hasn’t been mentioned before. But that just simulates the way our minds work. Our thoughts jump from topic to topic without an introductory paragraph, after all.</p>\n<p>So it’s psychology, feminism, and a critique of (parts of) the British class system. Oh, and it’s also partly a love-letter to London. I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I don’t know where I learned about this. It’s been sitting on my Kindle for a while. I have a feeling that a friend recommended it on Facebook. It’s subtitled “An Hallucinated Oral History of the Post-Punk Scene in Airdrie, Coatbridge and Environs 1978–1986,” which annoys me, but only because of that “<strong>An</strong> Hallucinated.” Not because it’s a subtitle. I like subtitles.</p>\n<p>And this subtitle describes its book extremely well, especially with respect to that incorrectly-articled vision. It’s the fictionalised biography of a band called Memorial Device. Or at least that’s partly what it is. It verges on magic realism at times. It’s presented as a series of interviews and parts written by other contributors (as opposed to the supposed author, “Ross Raymond”). The actual author does a fine job of presenting those different voices and making them <em>sound</em> different. The whole thing reads like an actual music biography where the author has drawn on the experiences of a range of people as well as their own experience.</p>\n<p>The hallucinatory part comes from the way some of those people speak, or write. They are variously damaged or otherwise otherworldly, and their mental strangeness comes across well — or is it the world that’s strange?</p>\n<p>Airdrie is in the west of Scotland, not far from Glasgow, so it’s very much the same part of the world I grew up in. This feels very realistic: there was a similar swathe of bands inspired by punk and the post-punk/new wave/new romantic scene around Dumbarton and environs. None of the characters were as much larger-than-life as some of the members of Memorial Device — or at least not that I knew — but that’s why this is fictional, I guess.</p>\n<p>Not the best thing I’ve read this, year, but not bad.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Gutenberg is a change to the web-based editor in the WordPress dashboard, not a separate app. I typed up my <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/09/01/chile-trip-part-1-there-and-back/\">previous post</a> in <a href=\"https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/\">MarsEdit</a>, as is my wont, and uploaded it.

				"title": "Chile Trip Part 1: There and Back",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>We’re not long back from a family holiday to Chile. I plan to write several posts about it. I’m going to take a thematic approach, rather than a purely chronological or location-based one. Though some will be that kind, too. There will be pictures, but not so much in this post, as it’s about planes, airports, etc.</p>\n<p>First, then, the whole business of travelling to another continent, and to the southern hemisphere of our amazing planet.</p>\n<h2>Getting There</h2>\n<p>We flew on Latin American Airlines, or LATAM. They were pretty good. I have no complaints. Maybe not as good as British Airways to New York a few years ago, but certainly much better than the budget airlines. The only thing was that we couldn’t get a direct flight. There just don’t seem to be any to Santiago. Though a taxi driver told us towards the end of our stay that BA have one direct flight a week. If so, then either we didn’t find it, it was on an inconvenient day, or it was really expensive. Or any combination of those.</p>\n<p>So we had a multipart flight out: first to São Paulo, then on to Santiago via Rosario. That was just a stop at another airport, without leaving the plane. Though some confusion in the booking system meant that we had different seats for the second part. We were not alone: it was all a bit chaotic, as new people boarded and wanted to sit in already-occupied seats, as people who were staying on didn’t realise they had to move. Still, it got sorted out.</p>\n<p>Also I didn’t realise till later that Rosario is actually in Argentina. It doesn’t count as visiting a country if you stay airside, but still, interesting to have touched down in two more countries than we planned to.</p>\n<p>Above all, it’s a <em>long</em> journey. Around 6000 miles, and about 22 hours, if memory serves.</p>\n<h2>Jet Lag</h2>\n<p>We didn’t suffer too much from jet lag going out. Except… almost every day for the entire three weeks I woke up around 4 in the morning. Usually got back to sleep OK. Our clock-time confusion was confounded after about a week when the clocks in Chile went forward by an hour. It’s the tail end of winter there, so it’s the start of summer time. But it’s earlier than when clocks in Europe change, relatively. Also it was <em>only</em> Chile: in Bolivia and Brazil the time was unchanged.</p>\n<h2>Taxis Home and Abroad</h2>\n<p>While I’m on travel I’ll just touch on taxis. Chilean taxi drivers, in common with those all over Europe, get out of their car and help you load your bags into the boot. This happens everywhere; except Britain. Or at least, except London. When we were getting a cab when we were coming home I was struck by the fact that all these people were struggling into the stupidly-designed-for-luggage black cabs with no help from the driver.</p>\n<p>And then I was ashamed when it was our turn, and the driver <em>did</em> get out and help us. But it’s uncommon.</p>\n<h2>Internal Flights</h2>\n<p>Chile is distinctive on the map for its length. It runs almost the entire length of the continent. So there are some long distances to travel if you want to see much of it. As it is, I couldn’t say that we saw <em>much</em> of it, but we did see some very distinctive areas. Notably the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert\">Atacama Desert</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Lagos_Region\">Lakes region</a>.</p>\n<p>They’re quite far apart, though, so we took some internal flights. All by LATAM (we should have signed up for their frequent-flyer programme), and all fine. Security at the airports was generally less intrusive than it is here. We didn’t have to take iPads out of carry-ons, and I once went through security with my metal water bottle full! Radical.</p>\n<h2>Long(ish) Distance Buses</h2>\n<p>The only other trip we took was from Santiago to Valparaíso, which was by bus (coach). A couple of hours. Very comfortable, if you could avoid hitting your head on the badly-designed overhead screens.</p>\n<h2>Santiago Metro and Valparaíso Light Rail</h2>\n<p>Santiago has a decent Metro system. You get a contactless card like London’s Oyster cards, called <em>Bip!</em>. Which is a great name, in my humble opinion. It also has the advantage over Oyster that you can make multiple journeys simultaneously with one card. So for a family of four, for example, you just put enough money on the card for everyone, and tap in four times.</p>\n<p>I don’t really know why Oyster doesn’t support this. My only guess would be that they thought it would cause too many complaints with people accidentally being charged twice.</p>\n<h2>Return</h2>\n<p>Coming back took even longer: 23 hours in airports and planes, but 27, 28, if you count getting to and from the airports.</p>\n<p>The weird thing here was that we flew from Santiago to Rio de Janeiro; then, after a four or five hour stopover, to São Paulo. An hour and a half there, and finally on to Heathrow. I don’t understand why it was like that, but as I recall it was the only available option when we booked the flights.</p>\n<p>The annoying part was that — seemingly because the Rio – São Paulo bit was a domestic flight — we had to collect our luggage in Rio, and then check it back in. We went landside, got Brazilian entry stamps in our passports, all that.</p>\n<p>We took off for Heathrow at 22:10, which made it 02:10 in the UK. So I wanted to get to sleep, but first I wanted to eat. On these long flights, though, they don’t rush to serve food like they do on a short European flight. So it was, I think, around 4 am before I could close my eyes.</p>\n<p>Adjusting back home wasn’t too bad, though. People always say it’s worse coming east, but, apart from sleeping late on Bank Holiday Monday, I didn’t have too much trouble.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

But when I was about a third through this, I had a dawning realisation: this appeared not to be science fiction.  The Clarke Award being for the best <em>SF</em> novel of the year, of course.</p>\n<p>At that point there were, to my reckoning, two things that don’t quite exist in the real world today: a self-driving car, and a kind of personal health sensor that can tell how much you drank last night, and if you’re pregnant. Neither is key to the plot or anything else, though.</p>\n<p>There was also a hint that global warming has taken a turn for the worse. But it could just be a year with a bad crop, and anyway, that’s hardly fiction, never mind SF.</p>\n<p>But then I hit part two, and it jumped forward 50 years, with corresponding technological advances. Part three takes us forward another fifty or so years.</p>\n<p>So what we have is a series of vignettes about the experiences of several interlinked families, over a hundred or so years. It’s interesting enough, but it’s limited. It’s about families and the future of how humans conceive, bear (or not), and raise children. Which is fine. But there’s very little about what else is going on in the world, in society. Or even much about the societal effects of the technologies we <em>are</em> looking at. Yes, by the end there are reports of a visibly-pregnant woman being abused in public for giving her baby a bad start in life (by not using the artificial uterus technology and associated genetic cleansing). But that’s it.</p>\n<p>It’s interesting enough, as far as it goes, but I’ve got to admit I’m surprised the judges considered it the best SF novel published in Britain in 2017.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

But glass suggests fragility, slipperiness: maybe everyone is walking on glass, as everything could collapse under them at any moment.</p>\n<p>It also suggests transparency: maybe everyone can be seen at any time. If you walk on a sheet of glass, you can be viewed from below. Which sounds not unlike the crosstime telepathic viewing that people in the castle are apparently doing of people in Earth’s past.</p>\n<p>All of which leads me to the conclusion — which I didn’t actually expect when I started writing this — that my long-preferred interpretation is the correct one: that Quiss and Ajayi really are former warriors who have been banished to the castle as a punishment for misdeeds. The castle has the technology to let people live vicariously in the minds of humans from its past. At one point Quiss probably touches Grout’s mind and partly causes the road accident.</p>\n<p>Is Grout really an exile from the same war, or a similar one? Probably not, but maybe. Maybe someone like Quiss or Aliya touched his mind at some earlier, vulnerable time, and something of their experience passed in to Grout.</p>\n<p>But again, what of Graham’s story, and Sara’s betrayal? What does that have to do with the bigger stories?</p>\n<p>I remain unsure.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

The ones I know I read, but didn’t blog about, are <cite>The Bridge</cite>, <cite>The Crow Road</cite>, <cite>Excession</cite>, <cite>Look To Windward</cite>, and <cite>The State of the Art</cite> — or at least the title story.</p>\n<p>As to why I didn’t blog about them, I guess I just didn’t write about my reading in some years.

Like this function or this expression; or my typical thing, “would this work” or how the fuck was that syntax again?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve sometimes found that they have a downside. When you are looking for code examples, then if a language has a REPL, very often the examples show the use of a feature <em>in</em> the REPL. Which may be fine, but is not so helpful if you’re trying to find out how to construct a class or a function.</p>\n<p>Which point, to be fair, Hjertnes does address:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  In other words, if your language require a lot of “foreplay” to run code, like declaring a namespace and a class etc (I’m looking at you Java and C#) it will probably not be the right thing. But if you can evaluate code without much fuss it is.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Java is supposed to be getting one soon, I believe, if it’s not already in version 9.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

And  “I must convince dad to get a VTR.” Who ever called it a V<em>T</em>R, rather than V<em>C</em>R? Outside of TV companies, at least.</p>\n<p>Still a great, crazy story with an ending that, now, seems less believable than it ever did. Well, the whole setup, really: the idea that you could have a child and not register them, and keep them away from all need for interaction with the authorities. Even if you lived on a private island, that’s hard to imagine nowadays.</p>\n<p>And I had forgotten what a misogynistic character the narrator, Frank, is. Which is, frankly, ironic.</p>\n<p>I recall reading a theory once that Eric, the crazy, dog-burning brother, doesn’t actually exist, that he was all a figment of Frank’s supercharged imagination. I was keeping that at the back of my mind as I read this time, and I don’t think there’s much evidence of it. But I’ll see if I can track down the actual theory.</p>\n<p>Here we go: <a href=\"https://performativeutterance.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/the-weaponry-of-deceit/\">“The Weaponry of Deceit: Speculations on Reality in <cite>The Wasp Factory</cite>” by Kev McVeigh</a>. Originally published in the BSFA’s <cite>Vector</cite> magazine.</p>\n<p>Reading it again now, McVeigh has a point: Eric can be seen as a metaphor for Frank’s masculinity. But I prefer to take it at face value: sometimes a crazy family is just a crazy family.</p>\n<p>The difficulty in searching for anything to do with this novel nowadays is that it’s on the English Literature curricula of both the English A-Levels and the Scottish Highers. So there are lots (and lots and lots) of sites offering analyses of it for students to <strike>plagiarise</strike> learn from.

I was a little late. I went straight to Oxford Circus. I came out of the tube station and just stood and watched the people walking down Regent Street. It was amazing, and seemed endless. Then I saw these two with great signs:</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1911.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1911.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protestors with signs: 'If Adolph (sic) Hitler flew in today... They'd send a limousine anyway'; and 'Bloody Trump, combing over hair, taking our tax money.'\"></img></a>\n\n<p>A Clash quote and a bad pun? Count me in.</p>\n\n<p>I walked down the pavement alongside the march for a bit, taking more photos.</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1915.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1915.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protestors, London, July 2018\"></img></a>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1921.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1921.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protestors, London, July 2018\"></img></a>\n\n<p>Before long we got to Trafalgar Square.</p>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1927.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1927.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protestors in Trafalgar Square, London, July 2018\"></img></a>\n\n<a href=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1949.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/2018/07/IMG_1949.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protestors in Trafalgar Square, London, July 2018\"></img></a>\n\n<p>There were many speakers and a few musicians. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_McCluskey\">Len McCluskey</a> told us that the police had estimated the crowd was over 250,000, which was surprising, since they tend to underestimate. Anyway, if so, it was the biggest since the Iraq war demo. More amusingly, we were a bigger crowd than at Trump’s inauguration.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I looked around and it didn’t feel that crowded. I’ve seen the O2 full, and I would guess that there were a similar 20,000 in the square.</p>\n\n<p>But it turned out when I left that there were many, many people in the streets around the square. I guess they didn’t want to push forward because the square looked full. I’m quite glad about that.</p>\n\n<p>The atmosphere was fantastic all day. The police presence was pleasingly low (or at least low-key), despite the stories of leave being cancelled and people drafted in from all over the country.</p>\n\n<p>Did it do any good? Probably not, in the sense that it won’t have any direct effect on Trump. But it made a \nlot of people feel good, and it showed the world that we care.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

The big G, the Catholic faith’s greatest gift to humankind and its subspecies, psychiatrists . . . well, I guess that’s putting it a little too harshly; I’ve met a lot of Jews and they seem to have just as hard a time of it as we do, and they’ve been around longer\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I had forgotten that the character of Daniel Weir (or “Weird”) was brought up as a Catholic. I don’t think any of Banksie’s other characters were. The man himself wasn’t. Not that it makes a lot of difference: his (and our) Scottishness has a lot more impact on his character — and his characters — than any religion his parents may have had.</p>\n<p>As always, I had forgotten some key parts, but I remembered more of this than of most. It’s still great.</p>\n<p>And I realise that these notes are becoming more about me, and what I remember, than about the books. But that’s fine. It’s my blog, after all, and as much as anything these <em>are</em> for me. They’re just out there in public in case anyone else is interested.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you haven’t read any Banks, then this would be a damn fine place to start. Though it’s interesting to note that — set as it is in the 70s and early 80s — it’s so dated that it feels almost like a period piece. One example: one of the members of the band buys an IBM mainframe and transfers recording-studio tapes to it, so he can play any track at the touch of a button. Something we can do from our pocket computers today.</p>\n<p>But there was one point that I thought seemed anachronistic. Maybe not, but aluminium takeaway cartons? Chinese &amp; curries? In 1973? Hmmm. I mean, it is in the foaming metropolis of Paisley, not Balloch. And even we had a Chinese by 1980, 81, or so. Still, I wonder when those things started to become commonplace.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I think I’ve read it twice before, but (and you won’t be surprised here if you’ve been following along) I don’t remember much about it.</p>\n<p>I didn’t recall, for example, that Sharrow, the protagonist, was a noble; or that it’s set as we approach the decamillenium on and around what I at first assumed to be an Earth colony, although one that is long detached from Earth. And it’s in a similar state to the last one I read, <cite>Feersum Endjinn</cite>, in that we’re in a decadent stage, where technology was more advanced in the past, but things have been lost or forgotten.</p>\n<p>The most notable example of that, of course, is the Lazy Gun, the big maguffin at the heart of the story. I had thought it was semi-mystical, or at least alien in origin. But now I think maybe not, it’s just from the more advanced past.</p>\n<p>Turns out it’s not anything to do with Earth, of course. Golter is a planet round an extra-galactic star. The million-light-year distance to any other star seems to be the “dark background” of the title. Though I still don’t really get why it’s called that.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I still loved it. And strangely the ending felt less bleak than I had remembered. Though it’s still pretty dark. And it turns out he <a href=\"http://www.rulit.me/books/against-a-dark-background-epilogue-read-290563-1.html\">published an epilogue online</a>.

But this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In the pre-git era, you updated your software annually and sent customers floppy disks. But if you’re running a big software platform, you might update your servers constantly—many times a day or every 20 minutes.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>is a bit over the top. There were a lot of changes between sending out floppies and continuous deployment.</p>\n<p>I question his (lack of) capitalisation. The command is <code>git</code>, all lower case. But if you’re talking about the application, you should spell it “Git”, with the capital. I think so, anyway. You would write about “CVS”, even though the command was (is) <code>cvs</code>; and “Subversion,” with the command <code>svn</code>. But at least it’s not as annoying as people who write it in all-caps.</p>\n<p>Lastly, when he says, “Computers are mercurial,” I’m assuming he’s wryly referencing what was once <a href=\"https://www.mercurial-scm.org\">Git’s major rival</a> in the distributed version-control space.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Email apps, especially ones that offer advanced services like “send later,” may be storing our usernames and passwords on their servers.</p>\n<p>To be clear what that means: if you use Gmail, for example, you put your Google username and password into the app when you set it up. You expect the app to store them securely on your device. But some apps may also be storing that username and password — your keys to all the Google services in this example — on computers owned by the company that makes the app. Computers over which neither you nor Google has any control.</p>\n<p>I’m not suggesting that the company I talk about below, or any other, is doing anything nefarious. They <em>need</em> to be able to log in to your mail server in order to send your mail later. But I hadn’t realised until now what that means, and I’m guessing neither will a lot of people.  And to my mind they don’t make what they’re doing clear enough.</p>\n<p>Worst of all, having passwords stored on unknown servers — at the very least, that’s worrying.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/connected/194\">episode194</a> of the <cite>Connected</cite> podcast, <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/people/mykehurley\">Myke Hurley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/people/federicoviticci\">Federico Viticci</a> were reviewing the latest version of the iOS (and Mac) app <a href=\"https://sparkmailapp.com\">Spark</a>. It’s a fine email app, which I was using on my iPhone and iPad. So I was alarmed when they mentioned in passing that mail handled by the app is routed through <a href=\"https://readdle.com\">Readdle’s</a> servers. That didn’t seem likely at first. Spark is an email <em>client</em>. You tell it what servers handle your mail, and it connects to them to receive and send. The servers belonging to the company that makes the app have no business getting involved in that.</p>\n<p>I did some digging. Whether or not <a href=\"https://mykewasright.com\">Myke was right</a>™ about mail going through their servers, the reality turned out to be much worse.</p>\n<h2>Digging</h2>\n<p>I tweeted at the Spark account. Here’s what happened:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SparkMailApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SparkMailApp</a> Hi, I was listening to a podcast today on which it was suggested that if I use Spark, then my email is routed through your servers.

Without such access, our Product won’t be able to provide you with the necessary communication experience. In order for you to take full advantage of additional App and Service features, such as “send later”, “sync between devices” and where allowed by Apple – “push notifications” we use Spark Services. Without using these services, none of the features mentioned above will function.\n</blockquote>\n<p>The wording “Spark requires your credentials to log into your mail system in order to receive, search, compose and send email messages” suggests that Spark the <em>app</em> needs to log into your server, which it does. But nothing about that says that your credentials will be stored on their servers.</p>\n<p>Further down, in point 4, “How Long Personal Data is Stored For,” in a table that includes “Type of information,” we see (emphasis mine) :</p>\n<blockquote>\n  Email address, email content for Spark Services, <strong>mail server credentials</strong>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So there it is. They do store your username and password on their servers, and they do tell you; though only if you read well into the kind of document that notoriously goes unread.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>For features like “send later” they need to store the fact that you want to send an email at a specific time, and log in to your server in order to send it. And to be fair, I’m sure they can’t be alone in keeping that kind of data. Lots of clients offer “send later” and similar services, and all of them will have to log in to your mail server to work. So they have to store your credentials on <em>their</em> servers to do it.</p>\n<p>And consider, if you use Gmail, that means your username and password not just for Gmail, but for <em>all</em> Google’s services, are now stored on somebody else’s servers. Their security might be great, but how do we know?</p>\n<p>The more I think about this, the more concerned I become. Passwords should only be stored in one place: a secure, trusted password manager. But above all, these services need to be much clearer about the fact that they’re storing our passwords.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

The loopers do their killing and body-disposal in the past, but by the time Bruce Willis comes into it, everyone involved is in the same time, 2044, the past of the movie.</p>\n<p>Also I thought I had heard that it wasn’t well thought of, but <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/looper/\">Rotten Tomatoes has it at 82% from audiences and 93% from critics</a>. That’s pretty good, isn’t it?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarysue.com/looper-review/\">This review at The Mary Sue</a> is  good on the weak points. Some interesting discussion in the comments, too.</p>\n<p>The future was unconvincing — people still driving petrol-burning cars in 2044 and 2074? And the status of women was terrible. You can be a sex worker or a farming mom in future America. I mean, OK, we didn’t see the rest of society, but it’s not great. And a major Bechdel fail. Oh yes, and: the currency is silver? Actual, metallic silver? Time travel has really messed things up.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed it on the whole, though, and the ending is great. We could have done without the voiceover, but maybe Rian Johnson, the director, has  plans to release a cut without it in one possible future. Now where have I come across that idea before?</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"title": "Top-Ten Album Lists",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Two album-related memes have been doing the rounds on Facebook lately. Both involve posting cover images of ten favourite albums across ten days. One involves doing so without any comment, but the more interesting one to me involves the poster writing about their thoughts on each album. I was nominated by my friend <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006622569425\">Peter</a> to join in with the long-form version.</p>\n<p>I’m all about owning my own content, as you know, and not having it locked away in Facebook’s walled garden. So my plan is to write about ten albums, but to do so here, on my blog. Links to the posts will automatically be crossposted to Facebook anyway.</p>\n<p>I started compiling a list of possibles, and thinking about starting to write posts. First I decided to restrict it one per artist. Otherwise I could just pick five by The Beatles and five by The Clash.</p>\n<p>But then I played some albums, and thought some more.</p>\n<p>See, I knew right up front that it was going to be almost entirely a white-guy fest. I wanted to approach it honestly, and not try to appear to be anything I’m not, so that’s how it would have to be. It would be reflecting my life as a music fan. As it stands the long list has one woman and no non-white people.</p>\n<p>But as I played those albums — albums I love — and as I thought about them, I realised two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I know these albums too well. I’m not <em>bored</em> of them, but they can drift past without me really being aware of them, through overfamiliarity.</li>\n<li>This won’t be very interesting, and certainly won’t have any surprises for anyone who knows me.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So I’ve come to a decision, I think: I’m going to do it slightly differently. I’m going to write about ten albums that I like <em>now</em>. Ones that I’ve discovered in the last few years, maybe, or that I’ve known for a while but have listened to a lot more in recent years.</p>\n<p>I’m not entirely sure what that list is going to look like. I only have two, maybe three definites on it at the moment, and it’s going to take a while to construct it. But I think it could be a much more interesting list — certainly for me — when it’s done.</p>\n<p>And I’ll do a post with a rundown of what the original list <em>would</em> have been, just for completeness.</p>\n<p>So watch out for those in the next few days.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>This is a great story about how some people have to fix things in the aftermath of something they did that may change the world fundamentally, if not destroy it. With that description it sounds very similar to Ellis’s earlier webcomic (with Paul Duffield), <a href=\"http://www.freakangels.com\">Freak Angels</a>.</p>\n<p>Which is a fair enough assessment, though the triggering event in this case is a combination of AI, the internet, and old magic; as opposed to the psychic powers in the older work. Ellis has deeply embedded the “start late” advice often given to aspiring authors. Both of the works under discussion, and some of his others, start long after the events that set their plots in motion.</p>\n<p>It can be a very effective device. We get to know characters who already know each other, and the past events are revealed gradually, through conversation and flashbacks. And the fact that the protagonists don’t at first fully understand what they did means that we learn along with them.</p>\n<p>This is great, but the only frustrating thing is that these three volumes — comprising fifteen issues of the comic — are to date all that there is. I don’t know if they plan to continue it, but the last issue came out in November, and the story is far from over. Googling has not so far revealed the answer to this.</p>\n<p>Recommended, though.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"title": "Tab Convert",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>That’s <strong>con</strong>vert, with the stress on the first syllable. The noun, in other words. As in, “I am a tab convert.” A convert, that is, to using tabs for indentation of source code, instead of spaces.</p>\n<h2>A Background of Spaces</h2>\n<p>From the earliest time that I learned about the tabs vs spaces debate, I’ve been a spaces guy. This is at least partly because of the influence of my then-colleague <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/author/benjamin-geer\">Benjamin Geer</a>. He has gone on to other, no doubt better, things, but he was probably the best programmer I’ve ever worked with. He introduced me to the idea that you should always use four spaces for indentation. The reason being that if you use tabs, people can have their editor’s tab size set to all sorts of different values, and it leads to source files not looking as you expect them to.</p>\n<p>Whereas spaces are spaces: you can’t go wrong with a space (or four).</p>\n<p>I’ve changed, though. I have become a convert, in my job, and maybe philosophically, to tabs.</p>\n<h2>Stack Overflow Survey</h2>\n<p>About a year ago there was a <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017\">survey of developers on Stack Overflow</a>. Among many questions, they asked about whether people used spaces or tabs. The <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/\">detail that got most attention</a> was that developers who use spaces were paid more on average than those who use tabs. I strongly suspect that correlation is not causation in this case, but it seemed noteworthy at the time.</p>\n<p>More interesting to me was the fact that <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#work-tabs-or-spaces\">more people used tabs</a>, at 42.9% against 37.8%. I was surprised: I thought spaces had won years ago. Though I often wondered (<a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/04/28/3353/\">sometimes publicly</a>, and I’m surprised to see that was only last year) why the default setting for Eclipse was tabs.</p>\n<p>Maybe that default, and others like it, is part of the reason for the statistics. Most people don’t change defaults. On the other hand, surely developers are the kind of people who are <em>most likely</em> to change defaults?</p>\n<p>Anyway, after the survey came out there were various posts about it, notably <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/15/spaces-vs-tabs\">John Gruber</a>, who said he was “a devout user of tabs”. OK, he’s not a developer these days, but there were others who are who said similar things. The one that struck me was one that I can’t locate now that said “tabs are semantic.” In other words, pressing the tab key means “indent here.” Four spaces means… four spaces? Could be an indentation, could be something else.</p>\n<h2>Everything Changes Imperially</h2>\n<p>So I was primed for the idea of switching to tabs, even though I still used spaces in <a href=\"http://tinlion.software/products/pertwee/\">my own projects</a>. And then I <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/03/03/imperial-adventures/\">started my new job at Imperial College</a>. When I first started looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility\">the code</a>, I quickly realised that it was indented with tabs throughout. I checked with my co-worker who is the main contributor. He didn’t mind, but they had always used tabs.</p>\n<p>Obviously I didn’t want to introduce a mixture. That’s what <em>really</em> messes up the display of code in different editors. You have to be consistent within a project. So if I were to change the project to spaces I would have to change every file. That was an unnecessary step; and per the above, I was primed to use tabs. They’re semantic, after all.</p>\n<p>I switched my IDE to indent using tabs, with the tab-stop value set to 4. And so we proceed, tabbing away merrily.</p>\n<p>So far I prefer it this way.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Seriously, during the first part it felt like it was targeted right at me.</p>\n<p>I am, as you probably know, a <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2015/01/05/the-illuminatus-trilogy-by-robert-shea-and-robert-anton-wilson-books-2014-17/\">fan and repeat reader of <cite>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</cite></a>. As clearly are Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, or the KLF, as they used to be known. This book is — what, a spoof of, a homage to? — <cite>Illuminatus</cite>. Explicitly modelled on it, referring back to it constantly.</p>\n<p>Plus there are lots of Beatles references, and I’ve been into them for even longer. Then among the characters are Alan Moore, who (in this corner of the multiverse) is a member — along with Cauty and Drummond — of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Noise_Terror\">Extreme Noise Terror</a>. Our world’s version of that band did collaborate with the KLF, but as far as I can tell they had no connection with Moore.</p>\n<p>So don’t expect to get too much accurate information about popular culture out of this. Plenty of references, though. Other characters include Michelle O’Bama, M’Lady Gaga, Yoko Ono (two versions), Lady Penelope, and her chauffeur/hitman Aloysius Parker.</p>\n<p>It’s a lot of fun. The downside is that it’s not very well written, at least as far as the dialogue is concerned. Most notable is the complete absence of contractions. Which is fine for an odd thing, or maybe to give one character a particular voice, but when no-one uses them, it all gets a little strange.</p>\n<p>The story is fun, though, and I finished it and immediately started rereading <cite>Illuminatus</cite> yet again, so there’s that.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Just over a month ago I posted a <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2018/02/01/4158/\">brief note</a> about job news, saying that more details would be forthcoming. I was, as I said then, just waiting for some paperwork.</p>\n<p>It took longer than I expected to get that paperwork sorted out, but I received and returned the contract yesterday afternoon. On Monday I start work at the <a href=\"http://www.sahsu.org\">Small Area Health Statistics Unit</a> (SAHSU), part of the School of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College.</p>\n<p>That’s quite a mouthful, but in short I’ll be working on programming something called the <a href=\"https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility\">The Rapid Inquiry Facility</a> (RIF), which is an open-source tool for studying health statistics.</p>\n<p>I’m neither a medical researcher nor a statistician, but I am a programmer (or a software engineer, if you want to be fancy). Our job is to understand the needs of someone — usually referred to as “the business,” but I’m guessing that will be different in my new job — and translate those needs into actions in software. That basic definition doesn’t change according to the problem domain. Whether it’s sending payments from one bank to another, checking a person’s right to work on a government database, or doing something with statistical data about health issues, the programmer’s job is to understand what the user needs and make things happen on a screen.</p>\n<p>The big difference for me, I think, will be that in this new role I’ll have the chance to contribute to doing something good in the world. As I said at my interview, I’ve mainly worked in financial software, and while, sure, people need banks, it wasn’t the most socially-usefully thing. The last half-year working at the Home Office had some value, but I was a tiny cog in a huge machine.</p>\n<p>At Imperial I’ll be able to feel that I’m actually contributing something useful to society, as well as doing what should be really interesting work.</p>\n<p>Oh, and: I’ll be back in Paddington, which I know from my Misys days, and it’s a much shorter commute than to Croydon.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"title": "I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead: The Dirty Life and Times of Warren Zevon by Crystal Zevon (Books 2018, 2) 📚🎵",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>You know how they say you shouldn’t meet your heroes? Well it turns out that sometimes that includes not meeting them between the pages of a book. I’m not sure I’d  call Warren Zevon a hero, but he’s definitely a hugely respected and much missed singer and songwriter.</p>\n<p>I knew of the tales of wild and crazy behaviour, though I hadn’t actually read any of them — except inasmuch as they come out in the songs. And anyway, those tales are a dime a dozen in rock’n'roll. A lot of this biography, though, is concerned with the people he hurt.</p>\n<p>Which is fine, not least since the author — his wife and the mother of one of his children — is a major one of those people. Most of his bad behaviour happened while he was an alcoholic — or while he was drinking, I suppose I should say, since the standard twelve-step narrative is that you never stop being one. Alcoholics Anonymous helped him to stop, though he eventually stopped going to meetings. He didn’t drink for seventeen years, and the opening chapter tells us that when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer he had a scotch. Who could blame him for stepping off he wagon at a time like that?</p>\n<p>So he comes across as a far from pleasant character. But my disappointment with the book is more about the complete focus on the man and his relationships, almost to the exclusion of the music.</p>\n<p>“The man and his relationships” sounds like an important set of themes to address in a biography. But in the case of a creative person — or really any person worthy of a biography — a key part of the story of their life is their <em>works</em>. If it’s a writer you’ll expect to read about their books; a politician, their victories and defeats; a general their battles. And of course, a musician, their music. It would be strange to read a biography of Beethoven or the Beatles that told of their personal lives but largely elided the music.</p>\n<p>Which may be the key: this isn’t a <em>biography</em>, as such. It makes no attempt to be comprehensive, and there’s no real narrative. Although there are plenty of reminiscences from Crystal, the vast bulk of the book is reminiscences from people in Zevon’s life, directly quoted and preceded with their names; almost like a play script. Presumably Crystal interviewed them all, but she herself comes across as just one of the interviewees.</p>\n<p>There are quotes from Zevon’s diaries, but he either wrote them in a very fragmented, abbreviated way, or they have been heavily edited. An example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Jan. 12, 1975<br>\n    … Took Jordan, visited Father at the steam baths. He gave me a handsome Seiko watch and $135 … quarreling with Crystal … T-Bone came over for spaghetti and I quaffed vodka martinis all night. T-Bone trounced me soundly at chess which surprised and aggravated me, but pleased me, too, by mellowing my lonely-giant-of-the-intellect trip … Made love.<br>\n  <br>\n  Jan. 15, 1975<br>\n    … Snorted coke which kept Crystal awake all night … she’s thinking of pregnancy and worried about chemicals in her body …\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>(All ellipses in original.)</p>\n<p>After he gets sober the diary entries become more frequent, which is good. But as a fan of his music, I would have liked to read a lot more about it: its creation, how it was accepted or not at the time, stories of gigs and recording studios, and all that. Unfortunately Crystal wasn’t really involved in that part of his life, and the interviewees who were — like Jorge Calderón or Jackson Brown — either weren’t asked to talk about it, or weren’t quoted doing so.</p>\n<p>So not quite the music biography I’d have liked, but not without interest.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

That is both true, and very remiss of me. Trouble is it’s now been quite a while since I saw them both.</p>\n<p>Still, I should be able to gather together a few memory cells.</p>\n<h2><cite>The Last Jedi</cite></h2>\n<p>I went on opening night, as <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/12/14/4017/\">I microblogged</a>.

There are some points that could have been done differently, or left out, or speeded up; and it had the weird effect towards the end of there being a series of times when I thought it was finished, and it still wasn’t. But all in all a fine work. Not as good as <cite>The Force Awakens</cite>, maybe.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>The worst thing about this book is that it tells you, two or three chapters from the end, that it’s only the first half of the story. Now, I knew there are two other books in the series, but I expected the first book to be at least capable of standing alone. Turns out it isn’t: the ending leaves us hanging right after the big reveal.</p>\n<p>The other worst thing about this book is that I’m not really that compelled to read on. I mean, I probably will, but it’s not like when I read <cite><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion\">Hyperion</a></cite>, say, and had to scurry around the city trying to find a copy of the second volume.<sup id=\"fnref-6028-Hyperion\"><a href=\"#fn-6028-Hyperion\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>After all the fuss <a href=\"https://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/26/publishers-and-sinners/\">about it not being published in the UK, and me not being able to get it</a>, I had high expectations. Probably too high, as it turns out.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong: it’s by no means a bad book, and it’s astonishingly accomplished for a first novel. I did enjoy reading it. Its true weakest point— ignore all that complaining above — is that it can be a little bit hard to understand the world she creates. Not impossible, though, and Palmer does go to some efforts to explain it with minimal infodumping. Or at least with infodumping disguised as a conversation with the reader, which works quite well.</p>\n<p>It’s about four hundred years in the future, and since the Church War some two hundred or so earlier, the world no longer exists as countries in the way that we know them. Instead people are members of one of seven “hives,” which they can choose to align themselves with at majority. Or not: some people are hiveless by choice.</p>\n<p>Countries mean less at least in part because of super-fast international transport by “cars,” which I think are probably suborbital rockets or similar. Though they may have a more advanced propulsion system. The most confusing thing is probably that the leaders of the seven hives are characters and each of them has several names. For any given one of them, each of the others might know them by a different nickname, and the narrator uses these interchangeably. It gets hard to keep track of who’s who.</p>\n<p>Global warming appears to have been conquered, or ameliorated to the point where it’s not a major concern. In fact it seems to be very close to a post-scarcity society. People only work at things they want to, and seem to be able to live OK without having to work.</p>\n<p>Apart from “Servicers,” that is. Our narrator, Mycroft Canner, is one of these. People convicted of sufficiently serious crimes can end up as one of these. They are essentially public slaves. They are required to work for seemingly anyone who asks them, and are paid in food and board — and occasionally other treats such as cinema tickets. But they have no other way to get these things.</p>\n<p>I found it quite a disturbing an idea; though it would almost certainly be better than being in prison; and at least they don’t have the death penalty.</p>\n<p>That’s not the most disturbing thing in the book. But I’ll say no more about that.</p>\n<p>As I write about it, my estimation of it is going up. Isn’t that strange? If I write enough about it I’ll probably stop to download <cite>Seven Surrenders</cite>, the next volume.</p>\n<p>Oh, yes, as I said, it says it’s “the first half” of Canner’s story; but there are two more volumes. Are they both short, or is the third one more standalone? There’s only one way to find out.</p>\n<p>But I have a stack of other things to read first. Also I realise I have no idea what the title has to do with the story. 📖</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-6028-Hyperion\">\nIf memory serves: it was a long time ago, and it may not have happened exactly like that. <a href=\"#fnref-6028-Hyperion\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

I was on the other side of the punk/metal wars, of course, and screechy vocals always put me off.</p>\n<p>I completely understand the spirit of that piece, though, and feel the same way about The Clash, the Velvet Underground, probably others.

I don’t know, maybe not; but this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  But we thought we were gonna live forever. The music too.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>is not how things were for me, for us. We didn’t think we’d live beyond the eighties. The nineties at a pinch As Queen put it, we were the ones who:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  grew up tall and proud<br>\n  Under the shadow of the mushroom cloud.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>But so too did the author of the AC/DC piece. He’s a decade older than me, but that still means he experienced the cold war.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s not generation, but location.

Which makes me surprised to read these stories about it not doing very well on opening weekend. And weirdly, from the <em>balcony</em>. I don’t know when I was last in a cinema with a balcony. I mean, the Rio, obviously, though probably not since <cite>Harry Potter 8</cite>; but I hadn’t been in the balcony before, and I don’t think I even realised that it had one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22310528_695400790653923_2498351281467612320_n.jpg\"></p>\n<p>But to the film of the moment. I tried to lower my expectations, I really did. But I’d read that <cite>Guardian</cite> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/blade-runner-2049-review-ryan-gosling-harrison-ford-denis-villeneuve\">review</a>, which was so unbelievably glowing. I listened to Mitch Benn <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_T9DqwB3e0\">hoping they wouldn’t fuck it up</a> and believed that they hadn’t.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_T9DqwB3e0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>But…</p>\n<p>OK, they <em>haven’t</em> fucked it up. But I’m going to have to break ranks with all the legions of newspaper reviewers who love it to death &amp; back (honestly, I can hardly find a bad, or even a mixed, review), and nearly everyone else.</p>\n<p>Because I didn’t enjoy it all that much. I spent a lot of the time (of which there is a <em>lot</em>) saying, “What the fuck is going on here? Why did they do that?” The former is fine, as long as it becomes clear over time, which it generally did. The latter less so: understanding characters’ motivations is fundamental to understanding and enjoying a work of fiction.</p>\n<p>But much worse than those: I spent some of the time bored.</p>\n<p>The main reason for that is that it’s paced like an 80s movie. Which is to say, much more slowly than we are used to today.</p>\n<p>I should have expected that, I suppose. The original <cite>Blade Runner</cite> moves slowly even by 80s standards. That’s part of its visual and storytelling style. So it’s reasonable that a sequel, even one thirty years later, should follow suit. But they could have picked the pace up <em>a bit</em>.</p>\n<p>The reviews all describe it as “thought-provoking” or similar, and it’s true that the questions of what it means to be human or to be artificial are in there. But to my mind there’s not enough of that. Which in a way is linked to another problem: world-building.</p>\n<p><aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-right\">\n        <p>It’s paced like an 80s movie</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside></p>\n<p>As before the world is very visually striking. What we have is the world of <cite>Blade Runner</cite> with thirty years of technological advancements. Like the film, the pace of advancement has been slow, but I suppose that’s not surprising, given how damaged the world is.</p>\n<p>But slowly or quickly, technology advances in parallel with a conversation <em>about</em> that technology. What’s missing here is any in-world debate about the legal and ethical status of replicants. Certainly there’s a nod to the idea that the casual use of “skin-job” is insulting and shouldn’t be used. But it never seemed that insulting anyway — indeed I think it’s only the voiceover version of the original that tells us it <em>is</em> an insult. Deckard likens it to the n-word. (He does so <em>using</em> that word, which, rightly, would not happen today.)</p>\n<p>In a more realistic world there would be a debate about replicants. There would be rights groups campaigning against using them as slaves, and even for them to be given full citizenship status. And from others there would be discrimination against them, abuse of them. That could all be going on in the background of this society — and the debate is not what the film is <em>about</em> — but I think a small acknowledgement that the debate existed would at least hint at a richer society.</p>\n<p><aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-left\">\n        <p>Technology advances in parallel with a conversation <em>about</em> that <br />technology.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside></p>\n\n<p>That all applies to the original too, of  course, but now it’s much more common for the replicants to be living among humans on Earth, so the conversation would be that much more active.</p>\n<p>And speaking of that commonality of the replicants on Earth, one question you might ask is, are there any humans actually left on Earth? Because only two characters appear to be unambiguously human.</p>\n<p>One is K’s boss in the LAPD, Lt Joshi, who could unknowingly be a replicant, though nothing suggests that. The other, Ana Stelline, who creates the memories that are implanted in replicants. She lives in isolation because of sensitivity to the environment, and the implication is that only a human can provide the memories. But since not all of the memories are actually hers, all that needs is gift for imaginative imagery. And, now that we know that replicants are fully-biological beings who can reproduce (whether only with each other or also with humans is unknown), then anything is possible.</p>\n<p>The situation appears to be that anyone with the money and without any disqualifying problem has left Earth. “A new life awaits you in the offworld colonies,” after all. I always suspected that the colonies would consist of grinding hardship based on subsistence farming, but I suppose the idea is you have replicant slaves to do the work.</p>\n<p>\n<aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-right\">\n        <p>There are no robots in these <br /> films.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside>\n</p>\n<p>The Earth that we see is incredibly empty. The original’s LA streets were packed with people, but now it seems sparsely populated at best. Empty highways — because of course nobody’s driving cars anymore. But the air is empty too. Mostly there’s only ever one car flying at a time. All those giant buildings might be filled with people, but you don’t get any sense of them being there.</p>\n<p>San Diego is a literal dump, and Las Vegas a nuclear wasteland. Apart from the still-standing casino hotel, of course. A million bottles of whisky and you choose Johnnie Walker Black Label? Come <em>on</em>. (That brand is owned by Diageo, though, which is the first of the big neon advertising signs you see.)</p>\n<p>I don’t know, I wonder if it was just my expectation of something more striking, more startling. Don’t get me wrong: I didn’t hate it, or even dislike it. I was just disappointed by it. Yet I think I want to see it again.</p>\n<p>I loved the music, by the way, though it was perhaps a bit overwhelming in places.</p>\n<p>\n<aside>\n    <blockquote class=\"pull-left\">\n        <p>I think I want to see it again.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</aside>\n</p>\n<p>And as a last thought: I still see people talking about the replicants being ‘robots’ or ‘androids.’ If it wasn’t clear from the first film, where they bled what seemed to be blood, it is powerfully obvious now: there are no robots in these films. The replicants are fully biological. They are probably more like clones, genetically engineered for enhanced strength and stamina.</p>\n<p>The original book had androids (the clue was in the title); but not these films.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I skimmed part of it, but got annoyed when it seemed to be about rich Silicon Valley entrepreneurs deciding to go “off-grid.” That’s all very well for them, but most of us have to make a living.</p>\n<p>More pertinently, since the main target for the attack was Facebook, it annoyed me because I use Facebook to keep in touch with people that I might otherwise not. For that, it can be very good.</p>\n<p>And yet… it struck a chord with, me to some degree. I realised that Facebook has increasingly become more of a time sink than a pleasure. Not that I spend vast amounts of time on it each day, but when I do open it up, I often end up spending longer than I’d have wanted to. And not reading updates from friends and family, but following links to articles and quizzes and nonsense, most of which I wish I hadn’t bothered with.</p>\n<p>By comparison, a similar length of time spent in my feed reader lets me read blog pieces by people I actively want to hear from, and which I’m generally glad I’ve read.</p>\n<p>But they mostly aren’t friends and family.</p>\n<p>And then there’s the fact that the Facebook algorithm is tuned to show me what <em>it</em> thinks I should see, not what <em>I</em> want to see. What I want to see is all the updates from my friends, in reverse-chronological order. And that’s all. But there’s no guarantee that it will show me everything everyone posts, and the order is close to random at times.</p>\n<p>One way to work round this is to visit people’s individual Facebook pages. You could see all your the posts by all your friends by going to each of their profiles in turn. But that would mean you’d have to keep track of all that: remember who you visited and when, and somehow manage the list of people.</p>\n<p>Keeping track of things is what computers are good at. The software should be doing that for us.</p>\n<p>So I’m thinking that what I want is an app that will do that for me: that will keep a list of my Facebook friends, and show me all their posts (which of course is what Facebook used to do).</p>\n<p>As far as I know, no such app exists. This seems strange and unlikely, but I don’t think Facebook make a public API available for third-party clients, so such an app would have to work by scraping the web pages, which is neither good practice nor much fun.</p>\n<p>Of course, what this means is effectively turning Facebook back into a set of RSS feeds — or now, <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/07/24/some-open-source-software-for-your-delectation/\">especially as I have some experience with them</a>, a set of <a href=\"https://jsonfeed.org/\">JSON Feed feeds</a>. Which would then be usable in all sorts of other places.</p>\n<p>Web scraping may be bad and painful; still, I think I want to write this thing. Watch this space.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

There didn’t seem to be much that was optional about it.</p>\n<p>The Kickstarter connection, though: you’ll be familiar with the idea of ‘stretch goals.’ If not, the idea is that the basic target is to make X amount of money, but if we make X + 10%, or whatever, we’ll be able to do these other things. Develop additional features, make the item in more colours, or whatever. My guess is that the term originally comes from sports.</p>\n<p>So this email included in the subject the phrase ‘stretch targets.’ Meaning we want you to do more this week/month/whatever, than we originally planned. It was clearly written by someone who thinks that the way to develop software faster is to work your staff to the bone. When in fact that’s much more likely to result in people taking shortcuts and making mistakes.</p>\n<p>In this team they’re <em>already</em> working weekends, and now they’re being ‘stretched’ even more. It bodes ill. But perhaps co-opting the language of positive things for something so negative is worse.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><h2>Past</h2>\n<p>I can remember when I first saw <cite>Star Trek</cite>.</p>\n<p>That’s not so unusual, but if my memory is right — and I’ve just more or less confirmed that it is — then when I first saw it was the absolute first time anyone <em>could</em> see it, in this country, at least.</p>\n<p>Here’s the memory (and it’s tied up, as many good things are, with <cite>Doctor Who</cite>).</p>\n<p>It’s 1969. It’s the summer holidays, and we’re in a holiday home with a TV. That in itself makes me doubt the memory, because back then holiday houses just didn’t have TVs. A lot of houses in general didn’t. But this memory has always told me that we were on a family holiday. And it’s Saturday, late afternoon. I’m settling down at the TV, and somebody says — I think it’s my sister — ‘Martin, <cite>Doctor Who</cite> finished, remember?’ Because it was <cite>Doctor Who</cite> time.</p>\n<p>And I said, ‘But this is <em>like</em> <cite>Doctor Who</cite>!’</p>\n<p>And as the new programme started someone else — my Dad, I think — said, with a tone of surprise, ‘He knows all about it!’ And then the <cite>Enterprise</cite> swooshed towards me out of the screen.</p>\n<p>I’ve long wondered how true this memory was. It was 1969; I’d have been five. But I just <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/BBC\">checked</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Initially, the BBC was the first-run broadcaster of Star Trek (12 July 1969-15 December 1971).<br>\n  …<br>\n  The series was shown in four seasons, the first on Saturday evenings at 5:15 pm (in the time slot usually taken by Doctor Who).\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which exactly matches my memory: summer, Saturday, <cite>Doctor Who</cite> slot. And the calendar confirms that the 12th of July 1969 was a Saturday.</p>\n<p>I wouldn’t be five for another month plus. Not a bad bit of early-memory retention. I wouldn’t have remembered it at all, if it wasn’t for one thing: trauma caused by fear that my parents would turn the TV off just as this exciting new programme was starting burned it into my brain.</p>\n<p>My Dad always liked <cite>Star Trek</cite> too, so I guess I was partly responsible for that.</p>\n<h2>Present</h2>\n<p>Yesterday I watched the first two episodes of <cite>Star Trek: Discovery</cite>, which are on Netflix (in the UK and Europe, at least; in the US they’re on CBS’s own new streaming service). And I really enjoyed it. I wouldn’t say it felt like being that nearly-five-year-old again, but it did feel like they’re trying something new and potentially very exciting.</p>\n<p>Today I was looking at <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5171438/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">its entry on IMDB</a>. It turns out there are user-written reviews there, which I don’t think I’d been aware of before.</p>\n<p>Sadly they are almost universally negative. ‘It’s not <cite>Star Trek</cite>,’ is a common theme. But there’s a strong whiff of racism and misogyny coming through. Two non-white women as leads means ‘social justice warriors’ are running the show, it seems. Well from what I’ve read of Gene Roddenbery, I think he’d have been happy to be called a social justice warrior. <cite>Star Trek</cite> was <em>always</em> about diversity and tolerance.</p>\n<h2>Future</h2>\n<p>I don’t know how many episodes of this new series they have lined up, but I know I’m looking forward to watching them. So is my inner five-year-old. So would my Dad have been. And so would Gene.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>If you work with plain text, as I prefer to, then you probably try out different text editors from time to time (or, you know, constantly). I recently tried out a nice one called <a href=\"http://www.bear-writer.com\">Bear</a>. It’s an attractive environment to write in, syncs well between Mac, iPhone, and iPad, has good previewing and exporting features, as well as a host of different themes to suit your preferences. All in all, it’s got a lot going for it. I used it exclusively for a while, and paid the first month of its subscription.</p>\n<p>But I’m dropping it.</p>\n<p>The reason why is simple: although it’s all about plain text notes, it doesn’t store your notes as plain text <em>files</em>. Instead, it keeps them all in some kind of database and syncs that via iCloud.</p>\n<p>Using iCloud for syncing isn’t a problem, but locking my notes away in a form that’s not accessible to any other text editor definitely is.</p>\n<p>Its export features are good, so it’s not that your notes are locked away irretrievably. But while you’re using Bear, you can only edit your notes — or view them, for that matter — <em>in</em> Bear. And that’s just not how I want to work.</p>\n<p>It’s kind of antithetical to whole plain-text ethos, to my mind. You should be able to switch text editors without having to even think about it. Just open the file in the new editor and get on with it.</p>\n<p>Next I tried the unimaginatively-named <a href=\"https://www.notebooksapp.com\">Notebooks</a>. A similar setup with the syncing, but you can point it at a directory of files on the filesystem. It has its own strangenesses, though, in that it wants to keep tight control of the directory structure, and when you look at the directory in Finder or another text editor, you find it has been polluted with <code>plist</code> files, one for each plain-text file.</p>\n<p>So I dumped that one, too.</p>\n<p>And right now I’m trying <a href=\"https://ulyssesapp.com\">Ulysses</a>, which is very much of the moment, because it has just switched to subscription-based pricing, and caused much furore in doing so. I happen to also be trying out the <a href=\"https://setapp.com\">SetApp</a> service, which is interesting in itself, and which includes Ulysses as one of the apps it makes available.</p>\n<p>It’s fine, but is also prone to dropping the odd <code>plist</code> file in my folder, I see.</p>\n<p>In the end I’ll probably stick with <a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\">nvAlt</a> for short-form notes on the Mac, using a folder synced via Dropbox, and <a href=\"http://omz-software.com/editorial/\">Editorial</a> on iOS. Not forgetting <a href=\"https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/\">Drafts</a> on iOS, of course, but you only type things there to export them somewhere else, really. And then <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html\">BBEdit</a> or <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a> for longer pieces.</p>\n<p>Those last two might become the subject of another piece, about how I don’t get what’s so great about BBEdit.  But that’s for another time.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Because with the Tories we’ll only get a disastrously hard crash out.</p>\n<p>Vote to stop the Tories and save the NHS.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>And now, a table of contents.

Labour looked weak. She thought she could get a hugely increased majority for relatively little effort. So despite her repeated promises that should would not, she called a general election.</p>\n<p>Now, however, it might have backfired on her. The polls have shifted (though we know we can’t trust polls). Quite dramatically by some measures. It’s looking like she might end up with a <em>reduced</em> majority. Or even — dare we hope? — a radical change. A Labour majority seems implausible, but a hung parliament? That’s beginning to look a lot like a real possibility.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-fixed-term-parliaments-act\">The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act</h3>\n<p>But what of the act that was supposed to remove prime-ministerial whim from the choice of election date? It turns out it wasn’t worth the paper it was printed on. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011\">Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011</a> contains a clause that allows the current government to call an election if it has the support of the house.</p>\n<p>Not, I note, with a simple majority. Obviously that would be ridiculous for anything really important. No, a two-thirds majority is needed.</p>\n<p>And was easily obtained, owing to the failure of the opposition to oppose; and now May wants to repeal it anyway. But more on both of those later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brexit\">Brexit</h2>\n<p>When the election was called, my <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/04/18/scattered-thoughts-on-the-general-election/\">initial reaction</a> was that it would be all about Brexit. Nothing else loomed so large. And that was why I had concerns about Labour, because Jeremy Corbyn seemed committed to carrying on the madness that the referendum started.</p>\n<p>I wrote then:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n[P]eople will be torn between voting on the normal things they care about: health, security, homes, welfare, the economy… — and the big thing of our time: Brexit.<br>\n…<br>\nI can’t in conscience vote for a Labour party that won’t clearly place itself against Brexit. I just can’t. This means I have to leave the party, I guess. Corbyn called today for “A Brexit that works for all.” No, no, no.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I didn’t leave the party, and though there’s still some truth in that, things have changed. I’m not entirely sure when, or how; but somewhere along the line — the publication of the manifestos was certainly part of it — the normal things began to matter again. They never stopped mattering, of course, but they came back into focus.</p>\n<p>One of the normal things in particular: the NHS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"saving-the-nhs\">Saving the NHS</h2>\n<p>The Tories — modern Tories, at least — have never really supported it. They have always pushed privatisation of it, or as much of it as possible. Though to be fair, the last Labour government at fault there too, with their public-private partnerships.</p>\n<p>Tories, of course, have pushed for privatisation in everything, not just the NHS, at least since Thatcher. But even Thatcher kept her hands off the NHS. Not so this lot. Thatcher didn’t leave much to privatise, so their eyes are firmly on the last great publicly owned body.</p>\n<p>I fear that if May’s lot get back in, especially with an increased majority, we could see the beginning of the end of free universal healthcare in the UK. We are in that much danger.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thoughts-on-corbyn-past-present\">Thoughts on Corbyn, past &amp; present</h2>\n<p>I voted for Corbyn as leader twice. I had my doubts, but he always seemed to be on the right side; and as well, there was no good alternative (not the second time, anyway).</p>\n<h3 id=\"around-the-referendum\">Around the Referendum</h3>\n<p>Then I felt totally let down by Brexit &amp; after. To be fair, his “trigger Article 50 now” comments were slightly misinterpreted, but expressing himself like that just added to the idea that he couldn’t handle himself with the media.</p>\n<p>And that was certainly true in the first several months. It was like he — the party as a whole — had no media management at all.</p>\n<p>And at no time did he resist Brexit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"post-referendum\">Post Referendum</h3>\n<p>Then there was a series of mistakes, or bad decisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The three-line whip on the first Article 50 vote.</li>\n<li>Not resisting the invocation of Article 50 at all, even when criticising it.</li>\n<li>Waving through the vote to have the election. Because even if he didn’t want to stop it, how much better would it have been to make the Tories call a vote of no confidence? If only for the <em>schadenfreude</em>.</li>\n<li>Then he chose not to join the debate because May wasn’t involved? That’s what we call missing an open goal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-big-improvement\">The Big Improvement</h3>\n<p>Things have — and he has — got so much better since then. Somewhere along the line he started to come across as the dignified, statesmanlike man of principle that we knew he was. What changed? Was it better media management, or did the media actually start to give him some proper time?</p>\n<p>I don’t know, but the result is that the polls have turned round dramatically, giving rise to a measure of that most terrifying of things: <em>hope</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"manifesto-destiny\">Manifesto Destiny</h3>\n<p>Everything in the Labour manifesto is better for the country than everything in the Tory one. It’s as simple as that. “For the many, not the few” is the tag line they’ve been using, and it’s great. Simple, to the point, meaningful. And accurate.</p>\n<p>Not to mention costed. No “magic money tree” here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"back-to-brexit\">Back to Brexit</h3>\n<p>Although they haven’t said so, I could see a Labour government offering a second referendum. At least you can imagine them being more open to considering the possibility. Especially, of course, if they were in coalition.</p>\n<p>Now that takes us to the next question: if it’s a hung parliament, can we trust the LibDems not to back the Tories again?</p>\n<p>I mean, surely, this time… But that’s what we thought he last time, and look where that got us. So it’s a worry. But the LibDems are likely to get some of their old seats back, and Labour almost certainly can’t get a majority with the way things have changed in Scotland, so a coalition is our best hope.</p>\n<h2 id=\"may-madness\">May Madness</h2>\n<p>Now let’s turn our attention to our gloryless leader.</p>\n<p>Theresa May has presented an increasingly bizarre face to the world over the last few weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Her “Me, me, me” approach to presenting Tory policy (“If I lose six seats…” you only get one); that’s not how politics in the UK works.</li>\n<li>She wants to reverse the country’s stumbling steps toward better voting systems, such as the proportional system for the London Mayor.</li>\n<li>Politicising the terrorist attacks:\n<ul>\n<li>first troops on the streets, <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/05/27/losing-the-war-on-terror/\">as I discussed</a>;</li>\n<li>and now she wants to tear up human rights legislation. Next it’ll be internment, I shouldn’t wonder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She was seemingly scared to debate the other party leaders on TV. Debates may not be quite standard in British elections yet, but that is the way the world was moving.</li>\n<li>Oh, and along with voting reversals, she wants to <em>repeal</em> the fixed-term parliaments act, for what little use it was.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, it seems like she just wants to go backwards to an imagined Little-England past.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It won’t surprise you in the slightest to hear that I’m strongly advocating voting <em>against</em> the Tories, in whatever way you can have the most effect. I will be voting Labour, of course, but then I live in one of the safest Labour seats in the country, so that doesn’t have a lot of effect.</p>\n<p>However, I’ll also be joining other Labour members from Hackney tomorrow in heading over to Westminster North, which is a Labour marginal. I’ll be helping to get out the vote there.</p>\n<p>To you I say, please vote. Vote to stop the Tory mayhem. Vote to save the NHS.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

And I didn’t realise they were a two-parter.</p>\n<p>Except (spoilers) — oh, they’re not. They’re the first two of an <em>n</em>-parter, where <em>n</em> equals… who knows? At least three, and I’m sort of guessing from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_10)\">titles and directors</a> that it might be four.</p>\n<p>Anyway, in them we have one really good episode, one not so good.</p>\n<p>Episode 6, “Extremis,” was really very good indeed. Right up there with the best of this series so far. And good to get the mystery of the vault revealed early on, rather than letting it drag on to the end of the season and be an anticlimax.</p>\n<p>Episode 7, “The Pyramid at the End of the World,” despite the great title, was weaker, largely because of scientific irrationality and foolish plotting.

It’s one of those ones where a little bit more care, a few easily-insertable words, and it would all have held together much better. The problem with bad science or plotting based on foolish mistakes is that they can dump you out of the story.

Now they’re becoming alarmingly commonplace. I saw two outside Liverpool Street Station yesterday; armed, like the two above, not just with pistols, but with big, two handed things that most people would call “machine guns.” This increasing militarisation of the police was taken a step further this week when the Maybot ordered actual troops onto the streets. And I read that armoured vehicles were going to be deployed at the FA Cup final.</p>\n<p>Armed police on a beach: why?

Worry and low-grade fear aren’t terror, but they’re on the same axis. Overreacting like this is playing into the terrorists’ hands.

Oddly, they don’t explain why. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/25/bbc-store-closing-november/\">This Engadget article</a> says it’s because “people prefer streaming.”</p>\n<p>At least, that’s what the headline says. The article actually says the decision comes “following poor sales and tough competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Video.”</p>\n<p>Which is plausible enough, I suppose. Though I doubt that most people could explain the difference between a streaming service and one in which you have to download the file first. And in any case, Netflix and I think Amazon also allow you to download now.</p>\n<p>In fact my guess would be more that people prefer subscriptions. Amazon and Netflix are compelling because once your monthly fee is paid you can always watch anything they have. With the Store you had to buy specific titles, and there’s always that hesitation about paying before you watch something.</p>\n<p>I only ever used it to watch a couple of episodes of something I had left too late to see on iPlayer. specifically, one episode of <cite>Undercover</cite>. Apparently I spent £1.89, and I’ll be getting a £2.50 Amazon voucher to make up for it. Whee, an investment.</p>\n<p>So I guess I was part of the poor sales.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there is the opinion of some — and it would be of many in Britain, I imagine — that BBC programmes should just be available. We shouldn’t have to pay for them again. “We’re not just listeners and viewers, it belongs to us,” as a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q2iZuU5WM\">great man once sang</a>.</p>\n<p>Maybe that’s the solution to the arguments over funding: treat the licence fee as a subscription charge. Increase it, make it optional, but include access to the BBC’s entire back catalogue.</p>\n<p>But the Engadget article goes on to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  If the rumours are true, BritBox — <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/07/bbc-itv-britbox-streaming-service-launch/\">the BBC- and ITV-owned streaming service that launched in the US earlier this year</a> — could be expanded to host more of the BBC’s back catalogue and eventually launch in the UK.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>BBC <em>and</em> ITV? Together? Well I never.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Back in Balloch in 1981, 82 or so we use to play a Pac-Man clone called Spout Rolla. But there are no references to it on the internet, as far as I can tell. So this is my story about it.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time a gang of kids — thinking they were adults, but not really — used to go to the pub, and play a game.</p>\n<p>The pub was actually the bar of a place called <a href=\"http://www.duckbay.co.uk\">Duck Bay Marina</a>. I see from that link that they now call it “Duck Bay Hotel.” Either way, it was a couple of miles outside Balloch, on the west bank of Loch Lomond.</p>\n<p>Why did we go there, when there were pubs in the town? Two reasons, I suspect. One, some of us had driving licences and the chance to use our parents’ cars, so why not? (I wasn’t yet one of them at that point.) And two, it had video games in the foyer.</p>\n<p>That had a dual advantage. We could play the games, and those of us who, let’s say, weren’t quite strictly within the parameters of the legal drinking age, could stay out of sight of the staff.</p>\n<p>So: usually two machines, as I recall, plus maybe a fruit machine or two. I first played Frogger there. It was the era when arcade games had started to extend beyond shooting things in space to other tests of skill, like crossing rivers on logs.</p>\n<p>Spout Rolla was in a similar vein. But it was a clear derivative of — let’s be honest, rip-off of — Pac-Man. I’m not sure I’d actually played Pac-Man at that point, but I must have been aware of it.</p>\n<p>The idea was you guided a paint brush moving around a watery maze, painting the maze behind it. Fish would come out and try to catch your brush. If you painted all the maze you got a new screen (which I think might just have been the same maze in different colours, maybe speeded up a bit).</p>\n<p>Instead of the power-pills of Pac-Man, there was one part of the maze that had a paint roller in it. If you approached the roller from the right direction, it went with you and you accelerated just for that section. Then you could turn back and roll over the fish that were following you, for extra points. And that was it.</p>\n<p>Simpler times, simpler pleasures, I guess. It never made much sense, but we liked it.</p>\n<p>Thing is, everything’s on the net today, right? Well, apparently not. When I googled it today, I found two surprising thing. First, that there are no references to “Spout Rolla game” to be found, with or without quotes round the first two words. Second, that <a href=\"https://mapcarta.com/17620080\">Spout Rolla is a place in Scotland</a>, namely a waterfall in Perth and Kinross.<sup id=\"fnref-3345-waterfall\"><a href=\"#fn-3345-waterfall\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Could this possibly be that most unlikely of things (at least before Rockstar Games): a Scottish game?</p>\n<p>My son suggested that there would be people my age trying to remember what the game was called. So I tried googling for a description of it: <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pac-man+clone+fish+paint+roller&amp;t=ipad&amp;ia=videos\">pac-man clone fish paint roller</a>. That search has selected videos, which I didn’t. But I did find a possible explanation.</p>\n<p>It seems there was a game called <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/arcade_crush\">Crush Roller, also known as Make Trax</a>, and the one I remember could be a rebadged version of that. Plus you can play it at that link. As with many games of the time, it’s not as satisfying playing them with arrow keys as it was with a joystick.</p>\n<p>So, no, it’s not Scottish, but it could possibly have been rebadged for the Scottish market. Or maybe just that one in Duck Bay, who knows.</p>\n<p>The only thing is that, seeing that version, I had forgotten about there being <em>two</em> rollers. I was fairly sure there was only one, but playing it felt familiar, so I guess Crush Roller/Make Trax is it.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-3345-waterfall\">\nInitially the only <a href=\"https://sv.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spout_Rolla\">Wikipedia page for it</a> I could find was in Swedish. But latterly (2019-12-08), I find it’s better known as “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sput_Rolla\">Sput Rolla</a>.” According to the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_waterfalls_of_Scotland\">List of waterfalls of Scotland</a>” article, “‘Spout’ is another common word found throughout England and Scotland for particular types of fall though it is usually replaced by ‘sput’ in the formerly Gaelic-speaking parts of the latter.” <a href=\"#fnref-3345-waterfall\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

And at Easter, which still feels like the right time of the year.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/11/28/raven-and-what/\">as you’ll know</a>, I thought last season was the best season of New Who. I may have been being a tad hyperbolic there… but not entirely.</p>\n<p>And now we’ve got “The Pilot,” the first episode of the new season. Introducing <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4929530/\">Pearl Mackie</a> as Bill Potts. Among other things, I’ve got to say that this would be a great jumping-on point; a fine episode for someone new to the series to start.</p>\n<p>The story was good, not great; there were unnecessary Daleks, but if that means they’re going to otherwise be given a rest for this season, I won’t complain; and we’ve got the mysterious vault that The Doctor and Nardole are investigating. I suspect it might be most of the season before we find out what’s going on with that.</p>\n<p>Nice references to the past with the pictures of River and Susan; and the people who were fighting the Daleks were <a href=\"tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Dalek-Movellan_War\">Movellans</a>, apparently. I learned this on Jason Snell’s <a href=\"https://www.theincomparable.com/teevee/doctorwho/\">Doctor Who Flashcast</a> podcast. I knew I recognised them, so I thought they must be <a href=\"http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Thal\">Thals</a>, and that we were right back at the start of it all. It’s a very long time since I saw either.</p>\n<p>So, The Doctor has been lecturing at Bristol University for maybe fifty years? Intriguing. And the mini-trailer that we got as well as the usual “Next time…” is even more so. Both Missy and John Simm (presumably as The Master). The start of The Doctor’s regeneration sequence. We know he’s going to regenerate, but not, presumably till the last episode.</p>\n<p>Though on that point, Capaldi said on <cite>The Graham Norton Show</cite> that he had already filmed his part of the regeneration scene, and the only thing they still had to film was the Christmas special. Not surprisingly he wouldn’t give an explanation of that paradox.</p>\n<p>I have a theory, or suggestion for how things might develop. They won’t do this, and they shouldn’t; but bear with me.</p>\n<p>In a reversal of the now-common trope of The Doctor’s companion falling for him, The Doctor falls for Bill. She, of course, is not interested. So The Doctor regenerates into a female form.</p>\n<p>That would be to put Bill’s sexuality too much to the fore, and of course be wildly unlike The Doctor. But it amused me to consider for a few minutes.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

That implies a path laid out for us, an unshakeable future that is planned and unchangeable. And it is entitled.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That is a perfectly normal use of the modern sense of the word “entitled,” and it still slightly bothers me, as it has lo! these several years.</p>\n<p>Because what it really means is that the person isn’t actually entitled to the thing in question. The older sense of “entitle” is to have the right to something — literally to have the <em>title</em>.</p>\n<p>The modern meaning — the “He’s so entitled” formulation — really means “He’s behaving as if he were entitled to…”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/entitle\">Dictionary.com gives the definition of <em>entitle</em></a> as:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  to give (a person or thing) a title, right, or claim to something; furnish with grounds for laying claim\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Merriam-Webster is similar;</p>\n<blockquote>\n  1:  to give a title to :  designate<br>\n  2:  to furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming something this ticket entitles the bearer to free admission\n</blockquote>\n<p>And neither has the modern meaning at all.</p>\n<p>But I’m slightly horrified to find that the built-in dictionary in MacOS <em>only</em> has the modern meaning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  adjective<br>\n  believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment: kids who feel so entitled and think the world will revolve around them\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s interesting, though, that its definition of <em>entitle</em> is similar to the two web-based ones. And <a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/entitled\">Cambridge</a> has <a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/entitle\">both</a>. It seems the difference is whether you use the verb or the adjective. The latter is the only one with the modern meaning.</p>\n<p>Language changes, and that’s fine. But I wish that people who use it in the modern fashion understood what it is they’re saying, and what it can sound like they’re saying.

I guess societies can go back as well as forward.</p>\n<h2>“Taking Flight,” by Una McCormack</h2>\n<p>Another rich person mooches around with no real aim in life, this time in a society that has genetically engineered slaves.</p>\n<h2>“Presence,” by Helen Oyeyemi</h2>\n<p>This is the most disjointed, disconnected of the stories. A heterosexual married couple avoid communicating with each other because she’s convinced he’s about to leave her. Until they do, and it turns out instead that he wants to postpone their holiday so they can try out some sort of therapy for grieving people that he has developed. They do, and things get strange. There’s potential here, but all the initial setup about them not communicating is just ignored after they get to the point, so it could have mostly been left out. It really feels like it wants to be two or more different stories.</p>\n<h2>“The Apologists,” by Tade Thompson</h2>\n<p>A super-advanced alien race have accidentally killed all by five people of the human race. The five are put to work helping the aliens reconstruct a simulacrum of Earth, while a daily apology is blasted at them out of a sound system (hence the title). They seem surprisingly untraumatised by this situation.</p>\n<h2>“The Arrival of Missives” (Extract), by Aliya Whiteley</h2>\n<p>Not sure why this is an extract. Probably the original work is too long to fit in the booklet. A during the First World War a sixteen-year-old girl is in love with her teacher. She decides she has to let him know. The extract ends just when something out of the ordinary is revealed.</p>\n<h2>Thoughts and Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Well, I haven’t made them sound very good, have I? I did actually enjoy reading them all, but reduced to capsule summaries, they aren’t going to win any awards. Oh, wait…</p>\n<p>I’ve no idea which one I’ll vote for.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

She dangled there all night, and in the morning, when they came to cut the body down, she was still alive.’ Webster became known as Half-Hanged Mary.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>But I can’t help thinking, if there’s anything to the story, wouldn’t they have taken her survival as <em>further evidence</em> of her witchy nature, and made sure they killed her next time? As it is, it sounds like she lived on.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

At some point in the evening I realised I wasn’t going to write a post, so I just said, “Fine: that’s allowed.”</p>\n<p>Today I started by going for a swim. After my <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/21/recent-events/\">new regime of exercise last summer</a>, I got out of the habit once I <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/02/recent-events-2/\">started a new contract</a>. So it was good to get back to it. (Which is not to say I haven’t swum or gone to the gym in all that time, but it’s been a few weeks at the moment.)</p>\n<p>After that I took a <a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com\">HackerRank test</a> for a new job opportunity. It’s a site that does programming tests. This one was, I suspect, a disaster. I hate doing that kind of thing: you’ve got a timer running, and the problem you’re trying to solve is unlike anything you’d have to do professionally… Anyway, suffice to say, it didn’t go terribly well.</p>\n<p>This evening was all about falling asleep in front of the telly. We tried to watch <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2920540/?ref_=nv_sr_1\"><cite>20,000 Days On Earth</cite></a>, the film about Nick Cave from a few years back. I got it a few Christmases or birthdays ago, but hadn’t got round to watching it till now. I enjoyed what I saw of it, but there was definite falling asleep on the sofa and missing chunks. Oh well, it’s a DVD: we can always go back.</p>\n<p>Oh yes: there was also a trip to Westfield, the time-void where hours go to die.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Yesterday a member posted a link to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39444025?SThisFB\">BBC story about the sexuality</a> of the new companion in <cite>Doctor Who</cite>. “Doctor Who gets first openly gay companion,” it says. Nice to know, but no big deal in 2017, right?</p>\n<p>Wrong, sadly. I woke to 81 comments on the FB post. That’s a huge number by the normal standards of the group. It’s not very chatty. It turned out that a raving homophobe had stormed into the group and started to shout about the corruption of youth and I don’t know what all. The comments were a combination of his, and of calmer and more tolerant heads both calling him out and trying to debate rationally with him. To no avail.</p>\n<p>I had no choice — nor any desire — but to kick him out the group and block him. I wrote <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/BritishScienceFictionAssociation/permalink/10154445193132045/\">the following</a>, and I thought I should preserve it here;</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I’ve just had to eject a member from the group for making offensive remarks to other members. And worse, making remarks offensive to other members.</p>\n<p>  Specifically he was being offensive to all our LGBT members, and everyone who supports them, or who just supports humanity and common decency.<br>\n  Oh, wait, that’s <strong>all</strong> the other members, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>  Folks, I don’t need to tell you this, but it’s 2017. You can no longer argue that characters in popular TV programmes should not reflect the whole range of people in society. Nor can you make the argument that a character’s sexuality should have no place in <cite>Doctor Who</cite>, when it plainly has had a place at least since 2005.</p>\n<p>  Or don’t these people remember Rose being in love with The Doctor? Martha pining over him? Hell, go back further: Jo went off and married a male ecologist. And I’m sure at least a couple of other female companions went off with guys.</p>\n<p>  <strong>Flaunting</strong> their heterosexuality.</p>\n<p>  We won’t get any of that with Bill, at least.</p>\n<p>  Unless the next Doctor is a woman.\n</p></blockquote>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Borrowing that title from (what used to be) a regular section in Dave Langford’s <cite><a href=\"http://news.ansible.uk\">Ansible</a></cite> newsletter.</p>\n<p>The publishing sin in question, though, is quite astonishingly egregious, if the story is true. And I have no reason to doubt it.</p>\n<p>There’s a book called <cite><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/too-like-the-lightning-ada-palmer/1122537906?ean=9780765378002\">Too Like the Lightning</a></cite>, by Ada Palmer. I read a review of it a year or so back and thought it sounded really interesting. But I didn’t get round to trying to get it at the time.</p>\n<p>Something reminded me of it recently, and I tracked it down, at least to the publisher’s site that I linked to there. But I wanted to buy a copy on Kindle, and Amazon had no sign of it. This is relatively rare nowadays. Especially in SF, surely.</p>\n<p>I tried again a couple of times, but to no avail. There are a few chapters available on the Tor website; and they were one of the first major publishers to really push ebooks without DRM, so you’d expect something there, but no.</p>\n<p>I think you can get a Nook copy at the site above, but Nook? I mean, come on.</p>\n<p>Anyway, eventually I duckducked in the modern style, which is to say I just typed the question: “why is ‘too like the lightning’ not available on kindle”.</p>\n<p>I was led to a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5wwmo9/ada_palmer_ama_author_of_too_like_the_lightning/?st=j0pneb2r&amp;sh=d911c934\">Reddit AMA with the author</a>, wherein she said this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  That [making the book available on the UK Kindle store] can only happen if a UK publisher decides to publish it. Unfortunately <strong>UK publishers rarely publish female SF authors; a lot of them feel strongly that only male SF authors are likely to sell</strong>. If you want it to come out in the UK Kindle store, the best option is to write a quick e-mail to a couple of your favorite UK SP publishers to tell them you’re eager for these books — hearing from readers makes a big difference when publishers are considering picking up an author for localization.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Emphasis mine. If this is true — and again, I have no reason to doubt her word — I am beyond horrified that such an attitude can be prevalent at UK publishers. In 2017.</p>\n<p>Obviously what I want to do now is to buy a physical copy, here in the UK. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Lightning-Terra-Ignota-Assistant-Professor-History-Palmer/0765378019/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490566148&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=too+like+the+lightning\">It’s listed on Amazon UK</a>, but it’s not clear whether it’s an import from the US, or what. (Also very strange is the author’s credit in that entry: “Assistant Professor of History Ada Palmer.” It even makes it into the URL.)</p>\n<p>As well as blatant sexism, this is an example of the ridiculous regionalism that publishers still try to force onto the internet age. Also film and TV companies. Luckily Apple stopped the music business doing that.</p>\n<p>Bits don’t see borders. And neither should we. But that’s very much another conversation.</p>\n<p>Actually, you know what I’m going to do? I’m going to see if I can order it from <a href=\"http://pagesofhackney.co.uk\">my local bookshop</a>. Support your local, as well as fight sexism in a small way.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Today’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/22/how-the-new-electronics-ban-serves-the-trump-agenda/?utm_term=.0ee6e06efb73\">Washington Post WorldView</a> newsletter throws more light, a lot of shade, and a lot more confusion onto the <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/03/21/stupid-fawning-lapdog-government-apes-the-us-again/\">ban I linked to last night</a>, on taking laptops and tablets in hand luggage from certain airports.</p>\n<p>First, I didn’t realise that the list of affected airports is different between the UK and the US. Second, for the US, it is just a small set of airports, not all airports in the affected countries. The UK takes the broader approach — but for a different set of countries.</p>\n<p>The most interesting point to my mind is that this may all be Trump trying to help American businesses:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/us-unveils-new-restrictions-on-travelers-from-eight-muslim-majority-countries/2017/03/21/d4efd080-0dcb-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html?utm_term=.f8fd93ddc28d\">pressed by reporters</a>, officials in both countries said the measures were not a response to a specific threat, but rather the result of intelligence assessments that concluded groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda are seeking new methods to sow terror in the skies, possibly through hidden bombs in electronic equipment.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>And later:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Farrell and Newman suggested Tuesday’s order is an example of the Trump administration “weaponizing interdependence” — using its leverage in a world where American airports are key “nodes” in global air travel to weaken competitors. My colleague Max Bearak <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/21/what-is-the-logic-behind-trumps-new-electronics-ban-people-are-stumped/?utm_term=.41d88b6c74d5\">detailed how this could be a part of Trump’s wider protectionist agenda</a>. In February, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-08/u-s-airline-chiefs-set-to-talk-jobs-traffic-control-with-trump\">met with executives of U.S. airlines</a> and pledged that he would help them compete against foreign carriers that receive subsidies from their home governments.</p>\n<p>  “A lot of that competition is subsidized by governments, big league,” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/21/what-is-the-logic-behind-trumps-new-electronics-ban-people-are-stumped/?utm_term=.41d88b6c74d5\">said</a> Trump at that meeting. “I’ve heard that complaint from different people in this room. Probably about one hour after I got elected, I was inundated with calls from your industry and many other industries, because it’s a very unfair situation.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So unfair. But if that’s what’s behind it, what the hell does our glorious leader get out of going along with a slightly modified version of it? It’s certainly not to protect British airlines, as they (unlike American airlines) are affected by the ban. Maybe my “lapdog” dig was exactly right. For years Tony Blair was referred too as George W Bush’s poodle. Maybe Theresa May is adopting the same role for Trump. Which is a horrifying thought.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/us-unveils-new-restrictions-on-travelers-from-eight-muslim-majority-countries/2017/03/21/d4efd080-0dcb-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html?utm_term=.0c6ec86f35ee&amp;wpisrc=nl_todayworld&amp;wpmm=1\">Another WaPo article</a> contradicts all that, though, suggesting that the whole thing might be based on some credible concerns:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  The U.S. restrictions were prompted by a growing concern within the government that terrorists who have long sought to develop hard-to-detect bombs hidden inside electronic devices may have put renewed effort into that work, according to people familiar with the matter\n</blockquote>\n<p>But it asks the question and fails to get a satisfactory answer, “Why not ban all electronics on flights, then?”</p>\n<blockquote>\n  People familiar with the discussions said the restrictions were designed to defeat the particular type of threat that is of greatest concern: the possibility that terrorists could smuggle explosives inside electronics and manually detonate them once on a plane.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if that makes sense (after all, its not like a computer in the hold is (or could hide) some kind of timing device): why just from a strange subset of airports, even in the countries of concern?</p>\n<p>And if it’s all based on a real threat, why the US/UK difference?</p>\n<p>They also raise the real concern that journalists, activists, and just ordinary citizens, will be separated from their personal information, leaving it under the control of unknown people.</p>\n<p>Buckle up, folks, this ride is only going to get stranger and more unpleasant.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

But I was just having another go, and I noticed that the version on the website is 1.0 (BETA 6.1), while I had BETA 4. A quick download and we’re up and running: it works!\n\nNow I just have to keep my MacBook running at all times. Oh well.\n\n[^recall]: I know, you probably won’t.\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Couple of thoughts about the news, tonight. First of all, CNN <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/13/politics/sean-spicer-donald-trump-wiretapping/index.html?utm_campaign=digest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=app\">reports</a> on Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s “counselor,” and her strange thoughts about microwaves:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other,” Conway said, before suggesting that surveillance could take place through phones, TVs or “microwaves that turn into cameras.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I want one of these magic microwaves. I mean, think about it: you can reheat your leftovers, then take a photograph of them and post it to Instagram. All from the same device.</p>\n<p>More sanely (at least slightly) they seem to be backing off from the nonsensical wiretapping accusations. According to Sean Spicer, the Whitehouse press secretary:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “The President used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So that’s OK, then.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"edition.cnn.com/2017/03/05/opinions/trump-tweets-fun-over-obeidallah-opinion/index.html?iid=ob_lockedrail_bottomlist\">another article</a> they treat it all more seriously, pointing out that doing down your predecessors is a tactic of dictators everywhere:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n  They, too, use the apparatus of government to support their whims. And worse, they also seek to punish their predecessors in office and political opponents — as we have seen in countries from Iran to Zambia to, of course, Russia.\n</p>\n<p>  How long until we hear Trump surrogates suggest that Obama might be guilty of a crime?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Closer to home, the UK government’s Mayhem programme involved them <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39262081?utm_campaign=digest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=app\">forcing through the Brexit bill</a>, so we’re teetering along the slippery slope, getting ready to run towards the cliff of deadly metaphors.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Corbyn has things in hand, though. He tweeted:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Deeply disappointing that govt denied the people, through Parliament, Brexit oversight &amp; refused to guarantee the rights of EU nationals</p>\n<p>— Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/841389075710017537\">March 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We will continue to demand that the stress they, and Brits in the EU, are being put under is ended, and they are given the right to remain</p>\n<p>— Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/841389122874933248\">March 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Labour at every stage will challenge govt plans for a bargain basement Brexit with our alternative that puts jobs &amp; living standards first</p>\n<p>— Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/841389197005053953\">March 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>This is the same Jeremy Corbyn who, just a few weeks ago, put a three-line whip in place to make his MPs vote in favour of the initial version of the bill — which is identical to the version that has now been passed, since the Lords’ amendments were all rolled back.</p>\n<p>I voted for him as leader, twice, but I regret it now, I’ve got to say. He’s a decent guy, and I agree with him on many — even most — issues. But on this, the most important thing facing our country today, leading to potentially the biggest disaster since the Second World War, he’s been completely useless. Worse: complicit.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Shhh: a secret gig!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Or something very like that. It was on the Friday night at the Mean Fiddler. Which I don’t think I had ever been to at that time, and which was a bastard long way from Tooting. But I wasn’t going to miss the chance to see SLF in a small club.</p>\n<p>What I mainly remember was that the Academy gig the next night was a bit of a letdown after the intensity of seeing them at the Mean Fiddler.</p>\n<p>But anyway, the point of all of this is that as far as I remember things, this all was — or was billed as — their farewell tour. That’s why the t-shirt (which I still have) says “Game Over.”</p>\n<p>Now obviously they’re around again, and I’ve seen them since, and bought albums they’ve released since. But my memory says they broke up in 87 (or it could have been 88, but I think not (though actually March 88 if <a href=\"http://www.setlist.fm/setlists/stiff-little-fingers-7bd6b20c.html?page=32\">this setlist site</a> is to be believed)), and then reformed later. But Wikipedia and <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/stiff-little-fingers-mn0000937098/biography\">All Music</a> both say I’m wrong.</p>\n<p>I don’t know. Who would <em>you</em> trust?</p>\n<p>Actually probably not me. I’m becoming more convinced as I look at that setlist site, that I must have seen them several times at the Academy, after moving to London in 87, and the supposed farewell tour must have been later. In which case the Mean Fiddler was a bastard long way from Walthamstow, but that’s still true.</p>\n<p>The second odd experience was that I clicked onto the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stiff_Little_Fingers\">Wikipedia talk page</a> to see whether the history was disputed at all. It isn’t, but around five sections in there’s a section entitled “the?”, in which someone asks whether they were ever referred to as “the Stiff Little Fingers.”</p>\n<p>And back in 2007 some guy called “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Devilgate\">Devilgate</a>” answered firmly in the negative.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

In fact, having written that, I just have: <a href=\"/categories/language\">language</a> (hopefully that link will work once I publish this).</p>\n<p>Today I want to talk about the word “pivot.” As you know, pivot has come, over the last few years, to mean change direction, especially in a political context. A recent example from the <cite>New Yorker</cite>: <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dont-be-fooled-donald-trump-didnt-pivot\">Don’t Be Fooled. Donald Trump Didn’t Pivot</a>.</p>\n<p>It sort of makes sense, but like many knew usages, I can’t help but wonder <em>why</em> it has come into this use.</p>\n<p>And for this one I also can’t help but wonder to what extent <cite>Friends</cite> is responsible.</p>\n<p>You’ll know the episode I’m thinking of, if you’ve seen it: Ross is moving in to a new apartment, and being too cheap to pay the delivery charge, ropes Rachel in to help him move a sofa. Inevitably they get stuck on the stairs, and he keeps shouting at her, “Pivot! Pivot!” to try to get her to turn the sofa in an unspecified direction.</p>\n<p>Of course, he might have been using it quite precisely: the sofa probably needed to rotate about a fixed point, which is what “pivot” originally meant.</p>\n<p>What it has come to mean, in politics, is a change of direction less than a U-turn (or flip-flop); but still quite a substantial one. I suppose it has a sense of turning without moving forward at the same time. Though I may be overthinking it there. It’s quite descriptive, but it seems like it has becoming ubiquitous incredibly quickly; and is already practically a cliche.</p>\n<p>Of course that’s just my view of the <a href=\"/blog/2017/02/08/optics/\">optics</a> of the thing.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Though I notice the article is two years old. It just came to my attention via <strike>Facebook</strike> one of Twitter’s occasional emails.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  David Tredinnick said astrology, along with complementary medicine, could take pressure off NHS doctors, but acknowledged that any attempt to spend taxpayers’ money on consulting the stars would cause “a huge row”.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Getting his defence in early, he goes on to say that his likely critics (he names Brian Cox specifically):</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “… are also ignorant, because they never study the subject and just say that it is all to do with what appears in the newspapers, which it is not, and they are deeply prejudiced, and racially prejudiced, which is troubling.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nice tactic: he knows he’s talking bullshit, so accuses people of racism. Last time I checked, astrology wasn’t a race.</p>\n<p>Nor was stupidity.</p>\n<p>And in the unlikely event that anyone reading this thinks I’m just being reflexively mean and as bad as the critics he fears, here’s a considered scientific opinion. The only possible known way the positions of the planets and stars at our birth could affect us is by gravity. And while gravity does travel all through the universe, it is very, very weak — the weakest of the fundamental forces. Just look at how hard it was to measure gravitational waves. We were only able to do that in the last year, and it took colliding black holes to make enough of a splash for us to measure.</p>\n<p>Is it possible that heavenly bodies affect us in some other, as yet unknown way? Yes. And here’s what science says about that: show us how, and we’ll study it. Demonstrate the mechanism by which this influence happens, and we’ll write down the equations that govern it and learn all about it. We’ll have to throw out all existing models of physics, but if you bring the evidence, that’s what we’ll do.</p>\n<p>That’s science.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>More trouble with the home network today. We had a smart electricity meter installed a few days ago. Though without the “smart” part, because they couldn’t get a good enough signal down in our basement. You’d think they’d have considered that possibility in designing them, since that’s the kind of place where a lot of people’s meters are. Anyway, I think it was interfering with our powerline connection.</p>\n<p>We have a BT HomeHub as our main router and connection out to the fibre. But the wifi was a bit crap up at the top of house. So about a year back I got a couple of powerline connectors and used them to extend the 5GHz network upstairs, using another router that we had accidentally acquired as the other access point.</p>\n<p>It worked fine, until just the other day. The first symptom was that the Sonos app couldn’t connect to the speaker. I did some diagnosis, and everything was just weird. We could mostly connect to the outside world without any trouble, but I couldn’t connect to the HomeHub’s web interface by name. Nor, I think, by IP address. And then in one of my experiments I tried a slightly different IP address (one that shouldn’t have existed on our network), and I found myself at… a Sky box.</p>\n<p>Now you know my dislike for that bunch. There’s no way I’d let their networking hardware on my LAN, any more than I’d subscribe to their channels. and in any case, just, what?</p>\n<p>I wondered if our network could somehow have got crossed with one of the neighbours’. But it seemed so improbable. The neighbouring network would need to be using the same <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-service-set-identifier-816547\">SSID</a>, at the very least.</p>\n<p>As you’d imagine, I started taking components out to try to isolate the problem. With just the BT HomeHub in place, things were back to normal. But as soon as I began adding parts, everything went weird.</p>\n<p>Eventually I concluded — guessed, really — that the smart meter might be using powerline itself. We’re supposed to get a screen-based device for monitoring usage, and maybe that communicates with the meter over powerline. And the meter could have an embedded sky router? That seems unlikely, but maybe Sky have the contract to do the phoning home for EDF.</p>\n<p>Anyway, since the root of the problem seemed to be at least partly to do with IP address conflicts, I decided to factory-reset everything and rebuild with a different IP address range (I’ve never used <code>172.16.0.0</code> before). Along with a new wifi SSID and password.</p>\n<p>And so far so good. But I’m having trouble getting the second router to route properly via the first, so upstairs is going to be problematic till I can solve that.</p>\n<p>All this is doing, of course, is making me wish that we could get <a href=\"https://eero.com\">Eeros</a> in the UK. A self-configuring mesh network is exactly what we need, and not all this jerry-rigged nonsense.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

It must know what it actually is.<br>\n  [...]<br>\n  only the court to which we all subscribe can give an answer: the European Court in Luxembourg.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>He/she (I’m guessing “he,” from the writing style) says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  But a case which—along with Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley, Steven Agnew, a Green member of the Northern Irish Assembly and Keith Taylor, a Green MEP—I am bringing in the Dublin High Court seeks to give us the power to travel back if we need it.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>And he explains that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  We access it via a national court. And it can’t be one of ours. One of the complaints in the Dublin case is that the other 27 have breached the Treaty by excluding us from Council meetings before we’ve notified under Article 50. And that complaint can only be made by a court in one of those 27. The Irish court is the natural choice\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which all seems fair. The idea seems to be that the European Court of Justice could rule definitively that we could revoke our triggering of Article 50 at the end of the two-year negotiating period. And if the deal is bad, or especially if there isn’t one, parliament is likely to call another referendum in those circumstances, wherein we’ll know exactly what we’re voting for, and get it right this time.</p>\n<p>A small hope, like I say. And it doesn’t protect us from the damage that’s being inflicted in the meantime.</p>\n<p>But a small hope is better than none at all.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

At which time I was going to be traveling to King’s Cross to get a train to Edinburgh, which is a wee bit inconvenient.</p>\n<p>As it happened by just after ten I was <em>at</em> KX, and buying my lunch for the journey. But of course at that time I had forgotten about the tickets. By the time I remembered it was 12:44. The Palladium only holds just over 2000, so there wasn’t much hope.</p>\n<p>But I wasn’t helped by Ticketmaster’s ludicrous captcha overkill. Seemed like every time I moved from one page to another I had to click an “I am not a robot” checkbox and then select all the pictures containing street signs, or pickup trucks, or storefronts, from an array of tiny shitty pictures. Pickup trucks and storefronts? We barely have the former in this country, and we don’t use the latter term. And sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s in the pictures. I was doing this on a phone, after all.</p>\n<p>I wonder how serious their problem with automated ticket-buying bots is. I guess it must be an issue, given that the whole business of an inflated resale markets and touts at venues still exists.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all gone in London, but you may have a chance elsewhere.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I’m far from alone in that attitude, of course. But this means, most notably, that I would never get Sky TV. That has only ever mildly bothered me on the odd occasion when they’re showing a film I’d like to see that isn’t available elsewhere.</p>\n<p>But things have taken a turn for the worse lately, and it’s largely the fault of an American TV company that I generally heartily approve of: HBO.</p>\n<p>Actually the rot probably started to set in when Sky got the rights for <cite>Mad Men</cite> Season 5, after the first four had been on BBC 2. I’ve still never got round to seeing the later seasons.</p>\n<p>But the problem with HBO shows is that Sky has the exclusive UK right for something like five years. And that means I haven’t been able to see <cite>Westworld</cite>. Which is a shame, because everyone was talking about it a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>More worryingly by a long way for me, though, is that the new series of <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, which is not being made by HBO, but something called Showtime.

				"content_text": "\nFurther to my <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/24/i-wrote-to-my-mp/\">letter to Diane Abbot</a>, I saw her last night on <cite>Question Time</cite>. Disappointingly she was trotting out the line that, irrespective of what they believe, MPs are now tied down by the “democratic will of the people.”\n\nThat is utter nonsense.\n\n## Did the Referendum Give a Democratic Mandate?\n\nThe referendum, as <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/06/25/sixty-three-percent/\">I have said before</a>, did not provide a sufficient majority to change the country’s constitution. In fact, it did not provide a majority at all: thirty-seven percent of the electorate voted to leave. That is under <em>no</em> circumstances a democratic mandate.\n\n## Do MPs Have to Abide by the Referendum’s Result?\n\nThe referendum was advisory, not binding. That was very clear in the act of parliament that enabled it, though it wasn’t mentioned at all in the discussions running up to the event itself. The MPs were asleep at the wheel when the bill went through parliament: if they had given it the thought it deserved, they would have made its advisory nature explicit in the wording of the question; and more importantly, they would have set a proper threshold for it to take effect. A two-thirds majority is common in cases like this.[^inattentive]\n\nMPs make up the house of commons, half of parliament, the sovereign body in the UK. Their role is to scrutinise legislation and to vote on it in accordance with what they understand to be the best interests of the country.\n\nNo-one can say that Brexit would be in the best interests of the country. (Well, OK, they can say it; but they are demonstrably wrong.) MPs not only <em>can</em> vote against the triggering of Article 50: doing so is their <em>duty</em>.\n\n## Why Have Most MPs Switched to Being in Favour of Brexit?\n\nOr at least that’s the way it seems.\n\nI honestly don’t know. I  have my theory, though. They are running scared of the tabloid newspapers. And maybe, as one of my friends suggested on Facebook the other day, literally scared for their lives if they were to resist the Brexit onslaught. Remembering the tragedy of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36555996\">Jo Cox</a>, of course.\n\nIf the latter is really why they are doing it, then the terrorists have won. And even if it’s only fear of the tabloids, then the tabloid terrorists have won. If I were inclined that way I would call the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> and <cite>Sun</cite> traitors to their country for trying to ruin the British economy and damage British society, by forcing us out of the EU and assaulting the European Convention on Human Rights (which, if it needs to be said again and again, was written by Britons and is nothing to do with the EU).\n\n## What’s to be done?\n\nBuggered if I know. If our democratically elected representatives won’t do what they’re elected for and act in the best interests of the country, then I can only conclude that we’re fucked.\n\n[^inattentive]: And to be fair, we, the public, and the media, were equally inattentive to what the bill actually said.\n",

But yes, you read that right: I interrupted reading a Banksie. Now even though it’s a reread, that’s not something that happens normally.</p>\n<p>But then this is not a normal Banksie. My memory of it was that although I hadn’t loved it, it was good enough. But all I remembered from it was two scenes, and the overall background.</p>\n<p>I’ve got to say now, I’m afraid, that it’s down there with <cite>Canal Dreams</cite> as my least favourite. In fact when I reread <cite>Canal Dreams</cite> at some point in the past, I found it was better than I had remembered. This, though: this was worse than I remembered.</p>\n<p>I mean, it’s not <em>terrible</em>. If it were written by someone else, it would probably be fine. But no more than that, I’d imagine: no more than <em>fine</em>.</p>\n<p>What’s wrong with it? Well, it’s just not compelling in the way I expect Banks’s books to be. There are no  characters to speak of, except for the narrator, who is not especially endearing. That shouldn’t matter, but he’s not particularly anything else, either. His attitude to the war-torn environment in which he finds himself is essentially that it is inconveniencing him (and, to be fair, depriving him of his ancestral home).</p>\n<p>But the guy owns a castle. I mean, how sympathetic is he going to be?</p>\n<p>I don’t know, I think the main problem is just that it’s so bloody <em>bleak</em>. I was convinced that it must have been written while he was getting divorced, or otherwise going through a dark period in his life, but <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Banks\">the Wikipedia article</a> doesn’t suggest anything of the sort.</p>\n<p>Anyway, there we go. Another reread. But not one that I can imagine coming back to again. And there are plenty others still to come.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

As a Labour Party member, and one who voted for Jeremy Corbyn as leader twice, I’m very disappointed by the recent reports that he is planning to require MPs to vote in favour of triggering Article 50.</p>\n<p>I know it would be unpopular with certain tabloid papers if parliament were to prevent Brexit. But in truth I think it would be popular in the country. It seems highly likely to me that if there were a second referendum now, the majority would vote in favour of staying in the EU.</p>\n<p>That may be wishful thinking, but I don’t believe so: people have both realised they were lied to, and seen something of what Brexit will mean to the economy, to jobs, and to British society.</p>\n<p>And in any case, parliament is sovereign, and the majority in the referendum was far too small to justify what is, in effect, a constitutional change. Surely an MP’s duty is to vote in the way that is best for the country, and it is clear that leaving the EU would not be in the UK’s best interests.</p>\n<p>I urge you to resist the tyranny of the right-wing press, and go with the majority of Hackney North and Stoke Newington voters, and please: vote against triggering Article 50.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>Martin McCallion</p></blockquote>\n<p>That ought to do it, eh?</p>\n</body></html>\n",

He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president.<br>\n  …<br>\n  He has poisoned our water forever. Nixon will be remembered as a classic case of a smart man shitting in his own nest. But he also shit in our nests, and that was the crime that history will burn on his memory like a brand. By disgracing and degrading the Presidency of the United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>They were a crooked bunch, though, the Republicans back then. This on Spiro Agnew:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  He was a flat-out, knee-crawling thug with the morals of a weasel on speed. But he was Nixon’s vice president for five years, and he only resigned when he was caught red-handed taking cash bribes across his desk in the White House.\n</p></blockquote>\n\nWhich is not exactly accurate according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon\">Wikipedia article</a>, but it’s not too far off.\n\nThe quote Gruber draws our attention to is this:\n<blockquote>\n  Some people will say that words like scum and rotten are wrong for Objective Journalism — which is true, but they miss the point. It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place. He looked so good on paper that you could almost vote for him sight unseen. He seemed so all-American, so much like Horatio Alger, that he was able to slip through the cracks of Objective Journalism. You had to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly, and the shock of recognition was often painful.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhich reminds me of something I’ve been thinking about for a long time. Which is that I don’t think I <em>want</em> journalism to be objective. At least not in the area of political commentary. News is different, of course. But to me the best journalistic writing comes about when the writer’s personality comes through. When their unique voice can be heard in every paragraph. HST was of course the exemplar of that, but you don’t have to be as extreme as him to write things that have some heart and soul about them, that do more than just recite the facts.\n\nIndeed, that journalistic objectivity is part of the problem.

Journalists need to be able say, “This person says x but they’re wrong because of y and z.”\n\nAnd that isn’t necessarily even being subjective. It’s just being willing to not treat both sides of a debate as equal when they’re not.\n\nBack to HST on Nixon, and the crookedness of the Republicans:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  Two years after he quit, he told a TV journalist that “if the president does it, it can’t be illegal.”\n</blockquote>\n\nwhich is something that Trump has quoted, I believe.

As well as the many integrations and efficient handling of archiving and deleting emails, I like it because it is one of the only apps that lets you order mail in the One True Way.</p>\n<p>Which in case you’re wondering is oldest at the top. Newest at the top is fine for blogs and similar news-based things, but it’s not right for anything else. Call me old-fashioned, but that was the default in Eudora and probably in Mutt and Elm and all those too, and it was and remains the best way.</p>\n<p>Even Outlook lets you order it oldest-first. Though disturbingly few people take advantage of it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that’s not the point. The point is that today Dispatch let me down. I was typing a reply on my iPad this morning. The reply composition window looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/blog/wp-content/89068/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_5a7.jpeg\" alt=\"Fullsizeoutput 5a7\" title=\"fullsizeoutput_5a7.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:20px\"></p>\n<p>I did <em>something</em> — I’m not sure what — that made the composition window slide off to the right. Part of it was still visible, so I tried tapping on it. And it disappeared.</p>\n<p>There was no prompt, and nothing in my drafts folder. All that I had typed was gone, like tears in rain.</p>\n<p>I’ve just been trying to reproduce it, and I can, up to a point: if you slide the compose window to the right it goes off out of the way, like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/blog/wp-content/89068/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_5ab.jpeg\" alt=\"Fullsizeoutput 5ab\" title=\"fullsizeoutput_5ab.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:20px\"></p>\n<p>Which is actually quite useful, because it makes the compose window non-modal and lets you interact with your other messages. But somehow something can go wrong, even though I can’t make it happen now.</p>\n<p>Not the end of the world. I retyped the mail. But that’s not good enough, Dispatch.

I’m not sure about the title, but it’s a good piece, by Paul Mason (in fact, looking at the URL I suspect that wasn’t the original title).</p>\n<p>He starts by talking about <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com\">SoundCloud</a>, which is, for me at least, one of those sites that you would never think of going to; you just follow a link to something on it. Mind you, increasingly many sites are like that, and have been since perhaps the early days of blogging. Anyway, Mason says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The Berlin-based music service started as a super-cool platform for people who made music and wanted to share it. Last week, its owners admitted it was losing a million dollars a week, and could run out of cash before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>  …</p>\n<p>  The whole future of the little orange cloud now rests on whether it can get people to subscribe – for money.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which is interesting, and it’s one of those things that the net is a better place for it existing, and I’d be sad to see go away — but I can’t imagine ever subscribing to it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In the same week, another achingly cool online publisher, this time of blogs, Medium, also hit trouble.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>“Achingly cool”? Medium? I’m not convinced (disclaimer: for what it’s worth, my posts are automatically crossposted to Medium, among other places).</p>\n<p>He goes on to talk about how none of the social media sites is profitable, except of course for Facebook. He refers to</p>\n<blockquote>\n  the ailing internet platforms – not just Soundcloud and Medium but Ello, a wannabe rival to Facebook, and Tumblr\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tumblr is ailing? that seems surprising, considering how popular it is. But who knows (it’s also one of the other places I mentioned above). He goes on to exhort us to return to these sites, dust off our old user IDs and so on, and enjoy them again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  It will feel a bit like time travel – back to the period around 2010-12, when social media was associated with postmodernity, self-produced music and revolt, not fake news, white supremacy and rule by old men. But usage alone will not save the collaborative tools. We need new, cooperative ownership models. If basic word processors are effectively now shipped free with every device, so too could be a nonprofit music-sharing service, a free blogging platform and a place to keep in contact with our friends, without intrusive data-farming and a deluge of ads.\n</blockquote>\n<p>As to that, a free blogging platform — while not “shipped”, is easily available: <a href=\"https://wordpress.com\">Wordpress</a>. And there are others, of course. But it links back to what I was <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2017/01/07/independent-microblogging/\">saying the other day</a>: you’ve got to own your own content if you want it to be safe from services disappearing.</p>\n<p>As to that “railways” reference in the title, here’s how he finishes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  Medium, Soundcloud and ultimately Twitter are – like the railways – worth saving even if they cannot be run at a profit. 2017 can and should be a year in which the users of platforms reclaim these freedoms not as privileges but as rights.\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve got a lot of time for that view, actually, but those sites are mostly set up on a capitalist model (even if they have a community spirit), and I can’t see that changing any time soon.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I’ve <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/25/self-hosting/\">posted briefly about this before</a> (though that was Google, rather than Twitter). Sure, Twitter isn’t likely to go bust and delete everyone’s tweets without any warning.

So all you should have to do is type (Debian-based example):</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install PACKAGE-NAME\n</code></pre>\n<p>and away you go. Right?</p>\n<p>Well, usually. But today, not for me.</p>\n<p>I have a NAS box from Western Digital, which is really a little Linux server with a biggish disk drive. Some time ago I replaced the shipped distro with a newer one, but it was so long ago, and it’s been so quiet and reliable that I can’t remember what version, exactly.</p>\n<p>So first, there seems to be no way to interrogate it to see what distro it is. I mean, there <em>must</em> be, and <a href=\"https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/find-linux-distribution-name-version-number/\">this page</a> lists several ways, but none of them work on this box. I mean, <code>uname</code> shows me the kernel version and all that, but not the distro.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all that doesn’t really matter. I was only doing it to install <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node</a>, and I was only wanting to install Node so that I could run <a href=\"https://github.com/stephen/airsonos\">AirSonos</a>. We got a <a href=\"http://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/play1.html\">Sonos Play:1</a> for the kitchen recently, and it’s great, but the one weakness is that it doesn’t support playing from an arbitrary source one your phone, such as, say, your podcast app of choice (<a href=\"https://overcast.fm\">Overcast</a>, obvs).</p>\n<p>AirSonos is supposed to effectively turn the Sonos into an AirPlay speaker, so you can easily send audio to it from iOS devices. And you want it to be running on a server, so it’s available all the time.</p>\n<p>But it turns out that Node does not want to install on my NAS. Either by <code>apt-get</code>, as above, or by downloading the binary and unpacking it. (That installs it, obviously, but it won’t run.)</p>\n<p>I’m going to try running <a href=\"http://sonoair.mihosoft.eu\">SonoAir</a> on my MacBook. That’s a wrapper round AirSonos, and obviously it’ll only work (assuming it does at all) when my MacBook is awake. But life’s too short.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

This book is presented as a mysterious dossier which has been given to an FBI agent to analyse. It consists of a series of extracts from government and newspaper reports, and comments by someone who signs themselves “The Archivist.” These are further annotated by the FBI agent.</p>\n<p>The subject matter is mysteries: the many UFO reports, going back to Roswell and before; the mysterious goings on around Twin Peaks itself; stories of the Illuminati and the masons, and so on. Some of the quoted reports are, I assume, real. Many are part of the <cite>Twin Peaks</cite> universe.

Celebrity deaths? 2016 is well behind us — though regarding Trump and Brexit, the worst is still ahead.</p>\n<p>But anyway, I haven’t said anything about my <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/05/18/relaunch/\">work status</a> since <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/21/recent-events/\">back in the summer</a>. So I should bring things up to date.</p>\n<p>I had a few interviews, but no serious interest. Then July was ending, and I was beginning to think that soon we’d be going on holiday, and once we got back it would be nearly September. That was longer than I fancied going without having something lined up.</p>\n<p>And then I got a call from a recruiter telling me there was a bank in the City looking for someone with my exact skill set for a six-month contract. It was supporting — and to some extent building on — the products that I used to make at Misys. That wasn’t quite what I had seen myself doing. I was looking for something that was more of a change, more of a challenge.</p>\n<p>But I went in to talk to them and it all sounded pretty good. A significant number of the people who work there are ex-Misys, and I know them, so it would make for a relatively smooth transition.</p>\n<p>But a contract. I hadn’t really intended to go down that route. Still, the idea of being a freelancer appealed. I’d like to have a go at indie development one of these days, and the two can be complementary. We’ll see where that goes. But I decided to go for it. Set up the limited company (more on that in a later post), discussed the contract (including while I was on holiday) and started at the end of August.</p>\n<p>And it’s… OK. The people are good, the location is great. But the work is not that interesting, and the internal politics are… interesting.</p>\n<p>And there’s the pressure of knowing that you’re dealing (sometimes) with a live system. With real people’s actual money. Having only worked for a software company before, that feels unexpectedly high-pressure.</p>\n<p>All things considered, when my contract is up for renewal at the end of February, I don’t think I’ll be renewing it (even assuming they offer it to me, which they probably will). So I’ll be looking for another position shortly. Maybe contract, maybe permanent again. It depends what comes up.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

I thought it was now long gone, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BookshopGlasgow\">apparently not</a>. I was there, probably with my Mum — no, undoubtedly, as I didn’t go to Glasgow on my own till I was about sixteen — I’m guessing in about January, to spend Christmas money (often given in the form of <a href=\"http://www.nationalbooktokens.com\">Book Tokens</a> in those days, of course).</p>\n<p>I bought a stack of books. I don’t now recall what any of them were, but they were almost certainly mostly or entirely SF.</p>\n<p>As was the freebie that I got by accident. If memory serves I paid at the checkout and gathered up my books, or more likely the assistant put them in a bag for me, and then when I got on to the train back to Balloch, I took them out to have a look.</p>\n<p>And found I had more than I’d bargained for. Worse, more than I’d paid for. There was an extra book in my bag. One that I had never seen before, that I hadn’t chosen. One with an interesting title.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?1763\"><cite>Again, Dangerous Visions, Book 2</cite></a>, edited by Harlan Ellison.</p>\n<p>My immediate feeling was guilt. I had, effectively, stolen a book. I was a good Catholic boy, and would never have stolen anything.</p>\n<p>Then surprise: how had it got there? Presumably the assistant had mixed it up with the purchases of the person before me. There was probably someone sitting on a train right at that moment, realising that one of their books was missing. Poor them.</p>\n<p>Poor them, but lucky me. I don’t think I told my Mum it had happened. Or if I did, she must have said not to worry, it was too late to do anything; and that doesn’t sound like her. One way or another, we made no attempt to return it.</p>\n<p>But I think among the confusion and excitement of it all, I must have been slightly annoyed that it was the second volume: not much use without that first. And that “Again”: did that mean that the whole thing was some kind of follow-on?</p>\n<p>Obviously I know now that it did. When I went to university a few years later and met a community of fans, when they mentioned the famous <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Visions\"><cite>Dangerous Visions</cite></a> (non-) trilogy, I had some idea of what they were talking about.</p>\n<p>I’d like to say that it was some kind of formative experience. That reading those legendary short stories changed my approach to the genre, or my understanding of fiction, or what have you. But I can’t really say that it did.</p>\n<p>I eventually read the stories. Not having the earlier volumes of an anthology doesn’t cause any problem. Though I think I took the original, <cite>Dangerous Visions</cite> out of the library. Some of them were great, but I don’t recall finding any of them particularly memorable (though you never know: some things burrow deep). But one of the titles stuck with me, and is why I started writing this today.</p>\n<p>That was “A Mouse in the Walls of the Global Village,” by Dean Koontz. Though I couldn’t have told you who it was by, and I’m quite surprised to find that it’s Koontz, who I think of as a horror author.</p>\n<p>It came to mind because of something my beloved was saying about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/26/george-osborne-yuval-noah-harari-conversation?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">this interview between George Osborne and Yuval Noah Harari</a>. She mentioned the “global village” idea, and my mind jumped back to the story and the cascade of memories that go with that book. I downloaded the Kindle version of the book (and the first one) and started writing this.</p>\n<p>As I recall, that global village involved telepathy, and is very much not the one we are living in. But that doesn’t matter. It’s time to reacquaint myself with some old New Wave SF.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

That is, not every bookshop put it in the right section. After all, what is the right section? History? Sociology?

It was published in 1994 and consists of interviews with a selection of the women who were relatively newly on the scene, or were established but getting some more visibility, around that time. It was the time of Riot Grrrl, among other movements.</p>\n<p>So among the interviewees are Courtney Love, Huggy Bear, Liz Phair, Tanya Donnelly, Kristin Hersh, Kim Gordon… even Bjork. But there’s someone missing from the book. Nearly all of the interviewees, when talking about their influences or other women who were doing something interesting at the time, mention PJ Harvey. And she is not interviewed. Which is a shame. I would have loved to have read her thoughts on making music back then (or now, for that matter). And I’m sure Amy Raphael would have loved to interview her, so I’m guessing she didn’t want to do it.</p>\n<p>But aside from that, it’s an interesting work. Very much a document of its time, though no doubt the problems and challenges that these women faced have not changed that much. A similar book today, though, would have a very different complement of interviewees; and indeed would need a different subtitle: women musicians are much more prominent in pop and R&amp;B today, from Beyoncé on down. But maybe not so much in rock, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>Well worth a read, though.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

				"title": "Some Thoughts On Software Development",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>Before the job interview that I <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2016/07/19/2461/\">mentioned the other day</a>, the company asked me to answer some questions in writing. I didn’t get the job, but I was pleased with my written answers (and they presumably helped me to get the interview, at least). So I thought I’d reuse them as a blog post. None of this should be surprising for anyone who knows anything about the software development field, but it’s interesting to reflect on how things have changed across my career.</p>\n<h3>What are some of the fundamental changes in your approach to software development you have adopted in the last few years?</h3>\n<p>There are two main changes that are fundamental and independent of languages and deployment environments: agile techniques and test-driven development (TDD).</p>\n<h4>Agile</h4>\n<p>Moving from waterfall to agile development was probably the most significant change to development practices in the industry. We always knew that breaking work down into smaller units led to better estimating, more modular code, and just better software. The genius of agile was to extend that understanding to the period of time spent on a block of work. A two-week sprint, with its work being specifically estimated, planned and developed, is just infinitely more manageable than a project phase lasting months.</p>\n<p>Add to that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>self-organising teams which include someone from the customer or end user — or at least someone whose role is to represent the user;</li>\n<li>accepting that change will happen, and embracing it;</li>\n<li>and the discipline of saying that some features <em>won’t</em> be developed;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and we have a recipe for success.</p>\n<h4>TDD</h4>\n<p>Good developers always understood that testing was essential, and did it. But they used to follow a written test plan, or just have an idea of what needed to be tested and work to that. Testing was manual, hard to repeat, and error-prone.</p>\n<p>TDD brought automation. So instead of writing a document listing the required tests, we can write code. That inherently makes the tests rerunnable, so regressions get caught before they become a problem.</p>\n<p>But almost more important than that is the idea of writing the tests first. In an ideal world you write a comprehensive set of tests, write functional code until all the tests pass, and you’re done. It may not always work out exactly like that — in particular, adding tests to a mature codebase can be problematic — but writing tests first encourages us to write code that is easy to test, which tends to lead to better-designed, more modular code.</p>\n<p>An added bonus is that the tests can help to document the code, by showing our expectations. And of course they make refactoring easy and safe, as long as they are in place before you start.</p>\n<h3>If you were to start your last project over again, what would you do differently?</h3>\n<p>The project I’m thinking of involved rewriting the product’s GUI into a modern, responsive, browser-independent form, using HTML 5 and Twitter Bootstrap.</p>\n<p>The existing version was an old frames-based web app that only worked fully in Internet Explorer, and had to be tweaked when each new version of that browser came out. We had long wanted to modernise it, but there were always other demands on development time.</p>\n<p>Eventually I got a chance to try a proof of concept for the change. The application uses JSPs and Struts action classes, and the brief was to continue using these as much as possible. I decided to start with one of the main display pages, the one that users spend most of their time in. The idea was to give a quick demonstration of what was possible; and it did, to a point. But what I hadn’t realised was that frames are not part of HTML 5. There are ways to keep using them, but it’s not easy, and not good practice.</p>\n<p>So while the new look and feel of a single page was clear, it was far from clear how the various pages would interact, how they would be brought together to form the whole UI,  without frames.</p>\n<p>If I were to start the project again now, my first step would be to work out how to link the pages together into a single interface, in the absence of frames. Most likely I would use one or other of the forms of JSP includes.</p>\n<p>However, if there was the budget to do a more complete rewrite — by which I mean one that did not necessarily seek to use the existing JSPs — I would probably make much greater use of JavaScript and Ajax, and use the action classes just to provide data to the Ajax calls.</p>\n<h3>What is your approach to testing, and how would you test your application?</h3>\n<p>I would use a mixture of automated unit testing using JUnit, automated GUI testing, and actual user testing, if at all possible.</p>\n<p>This fits well with what I was saying above. There are, broadly, three levels of testing: unit, integration, and system. Though writing automated unit tests is a development activity, rather than a testing one. Certainly we wouldn’t expect dedicated QA testers to work at the unit-test level.</p>\n<p>So let’s assume that we have satisfactory unit-test coverage and we are interested in testing the application as a whole. Automation is obviously key here, as well, both because it allows us to easily repeat the tests regularly — for every checkin, in an ideal world (and see below); and because it removes the need for testers to manually step through a written script, which is boring and error-prone.</p>\n<p>I have used Selenium for automated GUI testing, with some success. It takes a significant amount of development work, because it’s doing a significant thing, but the effort should pay off.</p>\n<p>However, even after all that, there is still no alternative to having someone sit down and actually <em>use</em> the application. Automated testing might pick up outright errors in how the user interaction works. But it won’t catch fine details like misaligned elements, typos in onscreen text, or just generally how it feels to use the application.</p>\n<h3>What are the benefits of Continuous Integration?</h3>\n<p>Continuous Integration takes us beyond the traditional daily build. It does more than just building, and does it more frequently than just daily.</p>\n<p>At the simplest level it ensures that, for every commit, an incremental build of the complete product is made, and all the unit tests are run. In the most advanced case, as well as building and testing, the product can be deployed to test servers and integration tests such as the automated GUI tests mentioned above can be run. Realistically those tend to take longer, so it’s unlikely that you would do them for <em>every</em> commit, but they can certainly be run multiple times daily.</p>\n<p>So we get the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>frequent builds catch problems in code integration;</li>\n<li>unit tests are run frequently, catching any regressions;</li>\n<li>integration tests are run regularly, catching other problems;</li>\n<li>general confidence in the product is increased;</li>\n<li>developers are happy to commit changes frequently.</li>\n</ul>\n</body></html>\n",

Or sooner, if May goes to the country over Brexit or otherwise.</p>\n<p>In the end I wonder if Corbyn’s biggest problem isn’t just handling the Media.

Their point – renewing Trident was party policy, so the leader should not be speaking against it – was a valid one, but the floor of the House of Commons during the most important event of the parliamentary week, is not the place to argue about it.\n\nThe idea of Britain still being a nuclear power, and the doctrine of deterrence, are even more ludicrous now than they were during the 80s when I was a member of CND. But like I say, there’s a time and a place to have that argument, and it’s the party conference.\n\nMaya Goodfellow has a great piece about it all in <cite>The Guardian</cite>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe coup itself is unique in recent times, but Labour’s navel gazing is not.<br>\n…<br>\nThe tribalism that grasps the Labour party is part of its problem. There’s an idea among lifelong supporters and MPs that you’re born Labour, you call the party your own and you will never leave it. This makes some sense – these are people whose families for generations have been Labour members, who spend their weekends canvassing and invest all their spare time, emotional energy and money into the party. They want to feel they have control over it.<br>\n…<br>\nBut it [the tribalism] is also partly responsible for the current divisions. The people who feel entitled to call the party their own have competing viewpoints; some of them want to see a leftward shift and others range from wanting Miliband 2.0 to the rebirth of Blairism.<br>\n…<br>\nThe idea too often seems to be “Vote for Labour because we aren’t the Tories”.<br>\n…<br>\nInstead of slinging insults at opponents or branding them all Blairites, Corbyn supporters would do better to focus on the task at hand – winning a future general election.<br>\n<footer> —<cite><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/22/corbyn-labour-crisis-politics-tribalism-winning-elections\">When will Labour’s tribal warfare come to an end?</a></cite></footer>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That idea of the divisions on the left go further than just the Labour party. I thought it was well summed up by this banner that I saw on the Palestine Solidarity march two years ago:\n\n<img style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px\" title=\"Banner on march\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/89068/2023/img-2826.jpg\" alt=\"March with banner showing 'CPGB-ML Communist Pary of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist)'\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" border=\"2\">\n\n“Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist),” it says. You can just feel the layers of splits down the years that have led it to such an unwieldy name. Splits on the left are far from new. It’s an old criticism that we spend more time fighting among ourselves than fighting the real enemies.\n\nOr in this case, than working out how to get back into power. Because going back to Lincoln[^abe] and his compromises, to Hillary and her desire to get things done: it’s all for nothing if we don’t get a Labour government into power.\n\nThe problem is that Corbyn is “unelectable.” Is he? I’m not sure we know that. He’s sometimes compared to Michael Foot, who famously failed to win an election. But things are very different today from how they were in the eighties. It won’t be easy, but a Labour Party that got fully behind a left-wing leader might well be in a position to win power in 2020, when the next election is due. Or sooner, if May goes to the country over Brexit or otherwise.\n\nIn the end I wonder if Corbyn’s biggest problem isn’t just handling the Media. Maybe he needs an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell\">Alistair Campbell</a> figure (or hell, why not: a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Tucker\">Malcolm Tucker</a> one). Does he even <em>have</em> a press secretary or Director of Communications?\n\nAll of this leaves me not knowing how to vote in the new leadership election. My heart is with Corbyn, as most of his policies <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/09/09/leadership/\">match my own principles</a>. But if the MPs won’t get behind him again, then we’ll be right back where we are now, with the party not providing a useful opposition, and with no likelihood of electoral success.[^split]\n\nOwen Smith, on the other hand, seems more likely to fight for us to remain in the EU. But can we trust him?\n\nAnd either way, what will it do to the party as a whole? A party divided against itself, or worse, a party split in two, has no chance of forming a government.</p>\n</body></html>\n\n\n[^spielberg]: Though I wonder whether anyone with less Hollywood power than Spielberg could have got a film made that was so much about talking and legal and political manoeuvring.\n\n[^abe]: No left-winger, of course, though seeing the Republican Party today, it’s impossible to understand how he could have been one of its founders.\n\n[^split]: Because, I contend, of the split, rather then necessarily the leadership.\n",

If you haven’t heard it, it’s on <a href=\"https://itun.es/gb/k4Sj?i=2543099\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1PDRLVAkuiX1javMK1ZBLo\">Spotify</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw4w-kdu_34\">YouTube</a>, where I understand the younglings like to go.\n\n<blockquote>\n  Both guitars got the fuzz tone on<br>\n  The drummer's standing upright pounding along<br>\n  A howl, a tone, a feedback whine<br>\n  Biker boys meet the college kind\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter one of the choruses where he sings, “How in the world were they making that sound?/Velvet Underground,” he says, “Like this,” and launches into a verse of “Sister Ray.” It’s all very, very cool.</body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: Though to be fair, I should thank a group of friends from school that I’m not in touch with anymore for getting me into them. But let’s leave that aside for now.\n\n\n\n[^fn2]: Though let’s face it, we mostly do. If there was a god, and it didn’t want us to listen to loud music, then why would it have invented amplification?\n",

I was considering sending the memory back to Crucial and hoping I could get I refund. But then I tried one more thing. One of the new 8GB sticks along with one of the old 2GB ones.\n\nAnd it booted up, smooth as a cliche.\n\nOf course I tried swapping out one 8GB stick for the other, to check for the possibility that one of them actually was bad. But both of them worked. So it seems that this MacBook can take more than 8GB, but not as much as 16. Which is strange, but never mind.\n\nI'd have to say, though, that the difference in performance wasn't obvious. But I didn't spend  lot of time with it like that, because I still had the SSD to install. That's very slightly more involved, needing as it does a Torx screwdriver. But it's very easy.\n\nBefore all that I had made sure my old hard drive was thoroughly backed up, you won't be surprised to hear.\n\nI booted up in the new configuration and told the Mac to set itself up as a new installation. It downloaded El Capitan over the air and installed away.\n\nThere was one slight glitch in this process. Something went wrong with the installation and I started getting a kernel panic on bootup. I don't quite recall the details now, but I just reformatted the SSD and installed again, and it all went fine.\n\nAnd the difference... The difference is <em>astonishing</em>. Even with many apps open (I currently have twelve), and a whole stack of tabs in Safari, using it is <em>effortless</em>. Apps switch without the slightest lag. I can start anything up with only a few bounces. I've hardly even <em>seen</em> the rainbow.\n\nEven Lightroom, which is the heaviest-weight app I use on here, starts in under ten seconds.\n\nIn short, this is the way a computer should be.</p></body></html>\n",

For Jeremy Corbyn.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a member of the party before.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> I always thought that I was too independent to toe a party line; too many of my anarchist ideals, forged in the fires of punk, still stood.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe. But my anarchism, such as it was, was always on the socialist wing. And I recognise the idealism that drove it. I&rsquo;d like to think that humans could live without governments and leaders &ndash; that we are perfectible, and could form a working society through cooperation. But the fact is, of course, that that is not yet the case. And until it is, there are things worth standing up for, worth believing in. Worth fighting for.</p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to toe a line; but in May we crossed a line. After five years of a Tory government in all but name, we have a named one. David Cameron and his regime will go down in history as worse than Thatcher&rsquo;s; but until he does go down, we have to deal with the effects of it.</p>\n<p>On the morning after the election I resolved to join the Labour party and do what I could to help. This wasn&rsquo;t about electing a new leader, though I realised that would be part of it. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t about Jeremy Corbyn: I made the decision before Ed Miliband had even resigned, and enacted it before the leadership candidates had been nominated.</p>\n<p>And for what it&rsquo;s worth, I joined as a full member, not one of these £3 Supporters that we&rsquo;ve been hearing so much about.</p>\n<p>I think the aftermath of the Scottish referendum had some effect on my decision. Seeing how the failure of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote energised the SNP and led many supporters to join led me to hope that something similar would happen with Labour. As indeed it has.</p>\n<p>Anyway, getting back to that choice of leader. It&rsquo;s long past time that Labour had a woman as its leader, but neither of those standing are right for me. Where we are right now, Corbyn&rsquo;s views most closely match my own values. When he says things like this:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ndash; &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Economy in 2020<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>that is exactly the kind of thing I&rsquo;ve been saying about tax for years.</p>\n<p>There is much else.

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>There has been little in the news lately but the refugee crisis and the Labour leadership election. I'm here to talk, briefly, before the polls close on Thursday, about the latter.\n\nI just voted, and guess what? For Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nI've never been a member of the party before.[^fn1] I always thought that I was too independent to toe a party line; too many of my anarchist ideals, forged in the fires of punk, still stood.\n\nWell, maybe. But my anarchism, such as it was, was always on the socialist wing. And I recognise the idealism that drove it. I'd like to think that humans could live without governments and leaders -- that we are perfectible, and could form a working society through cooperation. But the fact is, of course, that that is not yet the case. And until it is, there are things worth standing up for, worth believing in. Worth fighting for.\n\nI didn't want to toe a line; but in May we crossed a line. After five years of a Tory government in all but name, we have a named one. David Cameron and his regime will go down in history as worse than Thatcher's; but until he does go down, we have to deal with the effects of it.\n\nOn the morning after the election I resolved to join the Labour party and do what I could to help. This wasn't about electing a new leader, though I realised that would be part of it. It certainly wasn't about Jeremy Corbyn: I made the decision before Ed Miliband had even resigned, and enacted it before the leadership candidates had been nominated.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I joined as a full member, not one of these £3 Supporters that we've been hearing so much about.\n\nI think the aftermath of the Scottish referendum had some effect on my decision. Seeing how the failure of the \"Yes\" vote energised the SNP and led many supporters to join led me to hope that something similar would happen with Labour. As indeed it has.\n\nAnyway, getting back to that choice of leader. It's long past time that Labour had a woman as its leader, but neither of those standing are right for me. Where we are right now, Corbyn's views most closely match my own values. When he says things like this:\n\n</p><blockquote>\n  Paying tax is not a burden. It is the subscription we pay to live in a civilised society.\n  \n  -- \"<a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/jeremyforlabour/pages/70/attachments/original/1437556345/TheEconomyIn2020_JeremyCorbyn-220715.pdf?1437556345\">The Economy in 2020</a>\"\n</blockquote>\n\nthat is exactly the kind of thing I've been saying about tax for years.\n\nThere is much else. I'm not convinced about leaving NATO, but I don't think it's a fundamental policy. I do think we shouldn't waste vast amounts of money on replacing Trident. The cold war is over, more or less.[^fn2] And even if Russia is getting alarmingly expansionist these days, a British not-really-independent nuclear missile submarine is going to worry them much.\n\nCorbyn might not be electable -- I doubt that analysis, but let's go with it for now -- but he should at least lead a Labour party in opposition that <em>actually opposes the government</em>. Which, with its slim majority, could actually be vulnerable.\n\nInteresting times ahead.</body></html>\n\n\n[^fn1]: The title of my blog is partly a nod to my long-time support of it, though.\n\n\n\n[^fn2]: I nearly typed \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars\">the cod war</a>\", which is also long over, but was much less terrifying.\n",

				"content_text": "\n<html><body><p>I'm taking the <a href=\"http://tempest.fluidartist.com/non-fiction/the-challenge/\">Tempest Challenge</a>.\n\nI was somewhere in the middle of the <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2015/03/22/emotionally-weird-by-kate-atkinson-books-2015-3/\">third book</a> I read this year when I heard of it, and I realised that all my reading so far was books by women, and so why not?\n\nThe idea of the challenge, in case you haven't clicked through, is to:\n\n</p><blockquote>\n  take <em><strong>One Year</strong></em> off from reading fiction by straight, white, cisgender male authors and instead read fiction by authors who come from minority or marginalized groups. This includes women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ authors along with a wide variety of other marginalized identities from which to create a reading list: people with disabilities; poor and working class authors; writers with non-Christian religious or spiritual beliefs; and for Americans, even reading books in translation by authors of any background will open up new viewpoints.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhich, when you list as many categories of author as that, sounds pretty easy. And so it is.\n\nSo far, as you'll have seen from my published notes to date, I've just read books by women. No trouble there. I'm currently reading <cite>Wild Seed</cite> by Octavia E Butler, which also adds African-American to the mix.\n\nThe only problem -- and it is, let's face it, a very minor one -- is when I see a book on my shelves that I think, \"Oh, I must read that;\" and then I think, \"but not this year.\" (Though it occurs that if I were to take \"writers with non-Christian religious or spiritual beliefs\" at face value, then I could, for example, carry on my Iain Banks re-read; but such writers -- atheist writers, at least -- are far from marginalised in Britain. And it wouldn't really be in the spirit.)\n\nI'm making two exceptions: one is a book I started last year, about the music scene in New York in the 70s. It's important preparation for our trip to New York in the summer, so I intend to finish that.\n\nThe other is if <a href=\"http://robert-galbraith.com\">Robert Galbraith</a> has a new book out this year. :-) And in getting that link I discover that it's due out in the autumn, which is pleasing to hear.\n\nApparently some people are offended by the very existence of this kind of challenge. Mostly straight white men, I wouldn't be surprised to hear. It's \"censorship\", apparently. I mean, what?\n\nYou'll read all about my reading adventures here.</body></html>\n",

Anyway, it’s all a bit arbitrary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vivalbertine.com\">Viv Albertine</a>, as I’m sure you know, was the guitarist in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Slits\">The Slits</a>. They had only a short time in punk’s limelight (though as I learned from this, they released a second album, not just the one I’m familiar with).</p>\n<p>This book is half about her early years and the punk days, and half about after. She went on to work as a filmmaker and then struggled to have a child, had serious health problems. Eventually she re-taught herself to play guitar, and started performing again (I <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2011/11/13/smashing-things-up-for-35-years/\">saw her supporting the Damned</a> a couple of years back, and then supporting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devilgate/statuses/345925502747435008?tw_i=345925502747435008&amp;tw_e=details&amp;tw_p=archive\">Siouxsie at Meltdown</a> a year and half back).</p>\n<p>It’s really interesting reading about a time I lived through, events I experienced — from afar, true, but still ones I felt part of — from someone else’s point of view. Especially that of someone who was at the heart of many of the events.</p>\n<p>And she writes with some style; it’s a compelling read. She makes some strange choices: for example, she only ever refers to her sister as “my sister”; we never get her name. Similarly with the man she marries. At first he’s “The Biker”, and then “my husband”.</p>\n<p>I suppose it’s a matter of protecting the privacy of people who are still alive — especially in the latter case, because he doesn’t come out of it terribly well. Indeed, it may be the case that the only people who are named are those who were already in the public eye to some degree.</p>\n<p>Any road, if you are into music, especially punk, at all, I would highly recommend reading this. I plan to get her new album — which came out two years ago, it turns out — <cite>The Vermilion Border</cite>.</p>\n</body></html>\n",
